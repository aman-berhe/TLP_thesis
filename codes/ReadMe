The codes are orgonized as Test file (jupyter Notebooks) and python codes as .py file.
Here are the python files that I have used:

1. Scene_Clustering_Representations.py: This file have different representations/embeddings of the texts in the subtite for clustering puposes
2. Segmentation_lib.py: It includes the segmentation and different preprocessing of the text files, There are different methods/functions the main one is sequence segmentation and preprocessing. There are 	also some metrics but not neccessary because they are also in the evaluationMetrics.py file
3. EvaluationMetrics.py: All the evaluation metrics are in this file
4. Subtitle_Truthvalues.py: This file manipulates the subtitle files and generate the truth values of the scenes for evaluation reasons.


Each of the python files have different function/methods and those are commented how the work and their inputs.


Keep track of this files for more updates:
