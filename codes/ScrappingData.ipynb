They're savages.<br/> One lot steals a goat from another lot, before you know it they're ripping each other to pieces.<br/> I've never seen wildlings do a thing like this.<br/> I never seen a thing like this, not ever in my life.<br/> How close did you get? - Close as any man would.<br/> - We should head back to the Wall.<br/> Do the dead frighten you? Our orders were to track the wildlings.<br/> We tracked them.<br/> They won't trouble us no more.<br/> You don't think he'll ask us how they died? Get back on your horse.<br/> Whatever did it to them could do it to us.<br/> They even killed the children.<br/> It's a good thing we're not children.<br/> You want to run away south, run away.<br/> Of course, they will behead you as a deserter.<br/> If I don't catch you first.<br/> Get back on your horse.<br/> I won't say it again.<br/> Your dead men seem to have moved camp.<br/> They were here.<br/> See where they went.<br/> What is it? It's Go on, Father's watching.<br/> And your mother.<br/> Fine work, as always.<br/> Well done.<br/> Thank you.<br/> I love the detail that you've managed to get in these corners.<br/> Quite beautiful.<br/> The stitching Oh, no, no, no.<br/> This stitch is very - It's beautiful.<br/> - Thank you.<br/> And which one of you was a marksman at ten? Keep practicing, Bran.<br/> Go on.<br/> Don't think too much, Bran.<br/> Relax your bow arm.<br/> - Quick, Bran! - Faster.<br/> Lord Stark! My lady.<br/> A guardsman just rode in from the hills.<br/> They've captured a deserter from the Night's Watch.<br/> Get the lads to saddle their horses.<br/> Do you have to? He swore an oath, Cat.<br/> Law is law, my lady.<br/> Tell Bran he's coming too.<br/> Ned.<br/> Ten is too young to see such things.<br/> He won't be a boy forever.<br/> And winter is coming.<br/> Good lad, go run back and get the rest.<br/> White walkers.<br/> I saw the white walkers.<br/> White walkers.<br/> The white walkers, I saw them.<br/> I know I broke my oath.<br/> And I know I'm a deserter.<br/> I should have gone back to the Wall and warned them, but I saw what I saw.<br/> I saw the white walkers.<br/> People need to know.<br/> If you can get word to my family tell them I'm no coward.<br/> Tell them I'm sorry.<br/> Forgive me, Lord.<br/> In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, - the first of his name - Don't look away.<br/> King of the Andals and the First Men - Father will know if you do.<br/> Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm, I, Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, sentence you to die.<br/> You did well.<br/> You understand why I did it? Jon said he was a deserter.<br/> But do you understand why I had to kill him? \"Our way is the old way\"? The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword.<br/> Is it true he saw the white walkers? The white walkers have been gone for thousands of years.<br/> So he was lying? A madman sees what he sees.<br/> What is it? Mountain lion? There are no mountain lions in these woods.<br/> It's a freak.<br/> It's a direwolf.<br/> Tough old beast.<br/> There are no direwolves south of the Wall.<br/> Now there are five.<br/> You want to hold it? Where will they go? Their mother's dead.<br/> They don't belong down here.<br/> Better a quick death.<br/> They won't last without their mother.<br/> - Right.<br/> Give it here.<br/> - No! Put away your blade.<br/> - I take orders from your father, not you.<br/> - Please, Father! I'm sorry, Bran.<br/> Lord Stark? There are five pups.<br/> One for each of the Stark children.<br/> The direwolf is the sigil of your house.<br/> They were meant to have them.<br/> You will train them yourselves.<br/> You will feed them yourselves.<br/> And if they die, you will bury them yourselves.<br/> What about you? I'm not a Stark.<br/> Get on.<br/> What is it? The runt of the litter.<br/> That one's yours, Snow.<br/> As your brother, I feel it's my duty to warn you you worry too much.<br/> - It's starting to show.<br/> - And you never worry about anything.<br/> When we were seven and you jumped off the cliffs at Casterly Rock, you were never afraid.<br/> There was nothing to be afraid of until you told Father.<br/> \"We're Lannisters.<br/> Lannisters don't act like fools.<br/>\" - What if Jon Arryn told someone? - But who would he tell? My husband.<br/> If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now.<br/> Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn't know, it died with him.<br/> And Robert will choose a new Hand of the King, someone to do his job while he's off fucking boars and hunting whores.<br/> Or is it the other way around? And life will go on.<br/> You should be the Hand of the King.<br/> That's an honor I can do without.<br/> Their days are too long, their lives are too short.<br/> All these years, and I still feel like an outsider when I come here.<br/> You have five northern children.<br/> You're not an outsider.<br/> I wonder if the old gods agree.<br/> It's your gods with all the rules.<br/> I am so sorry, my love.<br/> - Tell me.<br/> - There was a raven from King's Landing.<br/> Jon Arryn is dead.<br/> A fever took him.<br/> I know he was like a father to you.<br/> - Your sister, the boy? - They both have their health, gods be good.<br/> The raven brought more news.<br/> The king rides for Winterfell with the queen and all the rest of them.<br/> If he's coming this far north there's only one thing he's after.<br/> You can always say no, Ned.<br/> We'll need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion's chamber.<br/> - I'm told he reads all night.<br/> - I'm told he drinks all night.<br/> How much could he possibly drink? A man of his stature? We've brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar.<br/> Perhaps we'll find out.<br/> In any case, candles.<br/> Why is your mother so dead set on us getting pretty for the king? It's for the queen, I bet.<br/> I hear she's a sleek bit of mink.<br/> I hear the prince is a right royal prick.<br/> Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick.<br/> Go on, Tommy, shear him good.<br/> He's never met a girl he likes better than his own hair.<br/> Gods, but they grow fast.<br/> Brandon! I saw the king.<br/> He's got hundreds of people.<br/> How many times have I told you? No climbing.<br/> But he's coming right now, down our road.<br/> I want you to promise me, no more climbing.<br/> I promise.<br/> - Do you know what? - What? You always look at your feet before you lie.<br/> Run and find your father.<br/> Tell him the king is close.<br/> Where's Arya? Sansa, where's your sister? - Hey, hey, hey, hey.<br/> - Oh.<br/> What are you doing with that on? Go on.<br/> Move! Your Grace.<br/> You've got fat.<br/> - Cat! - Your Grace.<br/> Nine years Why haven't I seen you? Where the hell have you been? Guarding the North for you, Your Grace.<br/> Winterfell is yours.<br/> - Where's the Imp? - Will you shut up? Who have we here? You must be Robb.<br/> My, you're a pretty one.<br/> Your name is? Arya.<br/> Oh, show us your muscles.<br/> You'll be a soldier.<br/> That's Jaime Lannister, the queen's twin brother.<br/> Would you please shut up? My queen.<br/> Take me to your crypt.<br/> I want to pay my respects.<br/> We've been riding for a month, my love.<br/> Surely the dead can wait.<br/> Ned.<br/> Where's the Imp? Where is our brother? Go and find the little beast.<br/> Tell me about Jon Arryn.<br/> One minute he was fine and then burned right through him, whatever it was.<br/> I loved that man.<br/> We both did.<br/> He never had to teach you much, but me? You remember me at 16? All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls.<br/> - He showed me what was what.<br/> - Aye.<br/> Don't look at me like that.<br/> It's not his fault I didn't listen.<br/> I need you, Ned, down at King's Landing, not up here where you're no damn use to anybody.<br/> Lord Eddard Stark I would name you the Hand of the King.<br/> I'm not worthy of the honor.<br/> I'm not trying to honor you.<br/> I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink and whore my way to an early grave.<br/> Damn it, Ned, stand up.<br/> You helped me win the Iron Throne, now help me keep the damn thing.<br/> We were meant to rule together.<br/> If your sister had lived, we'd have been bound by blood.<br/> Well, it's not too late.<br/> I have a son, you have a daughter.<br/> We'll join our houses.<br/> It is true what they say about the northern girls.<br/> Did you hear the king's in Winterfell? I did hear something about that.<br/> And the queen and her twin brother.<br/> They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.<br/> And the other brother? - The queen has two brothers? - There's the pretty one and there's the clever one.<br/> Mmm I hear they call him the Imp.<br/> I hear he hates that nickname.<br/> Oh? I hear he's more than earned it.<br/> I hear he's a drunken little lecher, prone to all manner of perversions.<br/> Clever girl.<br/> We've been expecting you, Lord Tyrion.<br/> Have you? - Already? - Oh! The gods gave me one blessing.<br/> - Don't get up.<br/> - My lord.<br/> Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother? You have much to teach me, no doubt, but our sister craves your attention.<br/> She has odd cravings, our sister.<br/> A family trait.<br/> Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown.<br/> - Don't leave me alone with these people.<br/> - I'm sorry, I've begun the feast a bit early.<br/> And this is the first of many courses.<br/> I thought you might say that.<br/> But since we're short on time Come on, girls.<br/> See you at sundown.<br/> Close the door! Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her.<br/> She was my sister.<br/> This is where she belongs.<br/> She belonged with me.<br/> In my dreams, I kill him every night.<br/> It's done, Your Grace.<br/> The Targaryens are gone.<br/> Not all of them.<br/> Daenerys! Daenerys.<br/> There's our bride-to-be.<br/> Look, a gift from Illyrio.<br/> Touch it.<br/> Go on, feel the fabric.<br/> Mmm.<br/> Isn't he a gracious host? We've been his guests for over a year and he's never asked us for anything.<br/> Illyrio's no fool.<br/> He knows I won't forget my friends when I come into my throne.<br/> You still slouch.<br/> Let them see.<br/> You have a woman's body now.<br/> I need you to be perfect today.<br/> Can you do that for me? You don't want to wake the dragon, do you? No.<br/> When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say it began today.<br/> It's too hot, my lady.<br/> Where is he? The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality.<br/> May I present my honored guests? Viserys of House Targaryen, the third of his name, the rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, and his sister, Daenerys of House Targaryen.<br/> Do you see how long his hair is? When Dothraki are defeated in combat they cut off their braid so the whole world can see their shame.<br/> Khal Drogo has never been defeated.<br/> He's a savage, of course, but he's one of the finest killers alive.<br/> And you will be his queen.<br/> Come forward, my dear.<br/> Where is he going? - The ceremony is over.<br/> - But he But he didn't say anything.<br/> Did he like her? Trust me, Your Grace, if he didn't like her, we'd know.<br/> It won't be long now.<br/> Soon you will cross the narrow sea and take back your father's throne.<br/> The people drink secret toasts to your health.<br/> They cry out for their true king.<br/> When will they be married? Soon.<br/> The Dothraki never stay still for long.<br/> Is it true they lie with their horses? I wouldn't ask Khal Drogo.<br/> Do you take me for a fool? I take you for a king.<br/> Kings lack the caution of common men.<br/> My apologies if I've given offense.<br/> I know how to play a man like Drogo.<br/> I give him a queen and he gives me an army.<br/> I don't want to be his queen.<br/> I want to go home.<br/> So do I.<br/> I want us both to go home, but they took it from us.<br/> So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home? I don't know.<br/> We go home with an army.<br/> With Khal Drogo's army.<br/> I would let his whole tribe fuck you, all 40,000 men and their horses too, if that's what it took.<br/> Do you think Joffrey will like me? What if he thinks I'm ugly? Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.<br/> He's so handsome.<br/> When would we be married? Soon? Or do we have to wait? Hush now.<br/> Your father hasn't even said yes.<br/> Why would he say no? He'd be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.<br/> He'd have to leave home.<br/> He'd have to leave me.<br/> And so would you.<br/> You left your home to come here.<br/> And I'd be queen someday.<br/> Please make Father say yes! - Sansa - Please, please! It's the only thing I ever wanted.<br/> Fill that up! Boys, Rodrik, come on.<br/> Come on! Come here, you little beauty! Is he dead yet? Uncle Benjen.<br/> You got bigger.<br/> Rode all day.<br/> Didn't want to leave you alone with the Lannisters.<br/> Why aren't you at the feast? Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst.<br/> Well, you're always welcome on the Wall.<br/> No bastard was ever refused a seat there.<br/> So take me with you when you go back.<br/> - Jon - Father will let me if you ask him.<br/> I know he will.<br/> The Wall isn't going anywhere.<br/> I'm ready to swear your oath.<br/> You don't understand what you'd be giving up.<br/> We have no families.<br/> - None of us will ever father sons.<br/> - I don't care about that.<br/> You might, if you knew what it meant.<br/> I'd better get inside, rescue your father from his guests.<br/> We'll talk later.<br/> Your uncle's in the Night's Watch.<br/> What are you doing back there? Preparing for a night with your family.<br/> I've always wanted to see the Wall.<br/> You're Tyrion Lannister, the queen's brother? My greatest accomplishment.<br/> And you, you're Ned Stark's bastard, aren't you? Did I offend you? Sorry.<br/> You are the bastard, though.<br/> Lord Eddard Stark is my father.<br/> And Lady Stark is not your mother, making you the bastard.<br/> Let me give you some advice, bastard.<br/> Never forget what you are.<br/> The rest of the world will not.<br/> Wear it like armor and it can never be used to hurt you.<br/> What the hell do you know about being a bastard? All dwarves are bastards in their father's eyes.<br/> You at a feast it's like a bear in a trap.<br/> The boy I beheaded - did you know him? - Of course I did.<br/> Just a lad.<br/> But he was tough, Ned, a true ranger.<br/> He was talking madness.<br/> Said the walkers slaughtered his friends.<br/> The two he was with are still missing.<br/> Hmph.<br/> A wildling ambush.<br/> Maybe.<br/> Direwolves south of the Wall, talk of the walkers, and my brother might be the next Hand of the King.<br/> Winter is coming.<br/> - Uncle Benjen.<br/> - Robb boy.<br/> - How are you? - I'm good.<br/> Is this your first time in the North, Your Grace? Yes.<br/> Lovely country.<br/> I'm sure it's very grim after King's Landing.<br/> I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time.<br/> Hello, little dove.<br/> But you are a beauty.<br/> - How old are you? - Thirteen, Your Grace.<br/> You're tall.<br/> Still growing? I think so, Your Grace.<br/> And have you bled yet? No, Your Grace.<br/> Your dress, did you make it? Such talent.<br/> You must make something for me.<br/> I hear we might share a grandchild someday.<br/> I hear the same.<br/> Your daughter will do well in the capital.<br/> Such a beauty shouldn't stay hidden up here forever.<br/> - Your pardon.<br/> - I hear we might be neighbors soon.<br/> - I hope it's true.<br/> - Yes, the king has honored me with his offer.<br/> I'm sure we'll have a tournament to celebrate your new title, if you accept.<br/> <br/>\n",
