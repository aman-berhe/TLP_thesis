1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,834
If a photon is directed through a plane
with two slits in it...

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,149
...and either is observed...

3
00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:07,549
...it will not go through both.
If unobserved. it will.

4
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:11,109
If it's observed after it's left the
plane. but before it hits its target...

5
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:13,839
-...it will not've gone through both slits.
-Agreed.

6
00:00:13,999 --> 00:00:15,068
What's your point?

7
00:00:15,239 --> 00:00:18,072
There's no point.
I just think it's a good idea for a T-shirt.

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,914
-Excuse me.
-Hang on.

9
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,077
One across is Aegean.
eight down is Nabokov.

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,629
Twenty-six across is MCM.

11
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:35,788
Fourteen down is--

12
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:37,711
Move your finger.

13
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,599
--phylum. which makes 14 across
Port-au-Prince.

14
00:00:41,999 --> 00:00:45,833
See. Papa Doc's capital idea.
that's Port-au-Prince.

15
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:47,992
Haiti.

16
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,198
-Can I help you?
-Yes.

17
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,911
Urn. is this the high-IO sperm bank?

18
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:00,597
If you have to ask.
maybe you shouldn't be here.

19
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,635
I think this is the place.

20
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,713
-Fi|| these out.
-Thank you.

21
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:07,949
-We'll be right back.
-Oh. take your time.

22
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:10,679
I'll just finish my crossword puzzle.

23
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,395
Oh. wait.

24
00:01:23,199 --> 00:01:25,235
Leonard. I don't think I can do this.

25
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:27,913
What. are you kidding? You're a semipro.

26
00:01:28,559 --> 00:01:30,754
No. We are committing genetic fraud.

27
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,992
There's no guarantee our sperm's
going to generate high-IO offspring.

28
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,149
Think about that.

29
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,438
l have a sister with the same basic
DNA mix who hostesses at Fuddruckers.

30
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,631
Sheldon. this was your idea.

31
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:44,871
A little extra money to get fractional T1
bandwidth in the apartment?

32
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:48,236
I know.
And I do yearn for faster downloads.

33
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:51,592
There's some poor woman
who's gonna pin her hopes on my sperm.

34
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:54,637
What if she winds up with a toddler
who doesn't know if he should use...

35
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,156
...a differential to solve for the area
under a curve?

36
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,756
-|'m sure she'll still love him.
-I wouldn't.

37
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,838
Well. what do you wanna do?

38
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,309
-I want to leave.
-Okay.

39
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:09,595
-What's the protocol for leaving?
-I don't know.

40
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,751
I've never reneged
on a proffer of sperm before.

41
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,033
Let's try just walking out.

42
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:17,028
Okay.

43
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,709
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

44
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:29,232
Nice meeting you.

45
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,956
-Are you still mad about the sperm bank?
-No.

46
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,752
You wanna hear an interesting thing
about stairs?

47
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,239
Not really.

48
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,278
If the height of a step is off
by as little as two millimeters...

49
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,477
-...most people will trip.
-I don't care.

50
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:49,031
Two millime--? That doesn't seem right.

51
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,634
It's true. I did a series of experiments
when l was 12.

52
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:53,471
My father broke his clavicle.

53
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:56,395
Is that why they sent you
to boarding school?

54
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,154
No. That was the result
of my work with lasers.

55
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,075
New neighbor?

56
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,434
SHELDON:
Evidently.

57
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,637
Significant improvement
over the old neighbor.

58
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,430
Two-hundred pound transvestite
with a skin condition? Yes. she is.

59
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,394
Oh. hi.

60
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,549
-Hi.
-Hi.

61
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:20,198
-Hi.
-Hi.

62
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,713
Hi?

63
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,440
We don't mean to interrupt.
We live across the hall.

64
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,953
Oh. that's nice.

65
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:30,308
No. We don't live together. I mean...

66
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,429
...we live together. but in separate.
heterosexual bedrooms.

67
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,996
Okay. well.
guess I'm your new neighbor.

68
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,195
-Penny.
-Leonard. Sheldon.

69
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,918
-Hi.
-Hi.

70
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,752
Hi.

71
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,599
Well....

72
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,393
Oh. welcome to the building.

73
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:50,789
Oh. thank you.
Maybe we can have coffee sometime.

74
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,949
-Oh. great.
-Great.

75
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,758
-Great.
-Great.

76
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,799
Well. bye.

77
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,837
-Bye.
-Bye.

78
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,032
Should we have invited her for lunch?

79
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,112
No. We're gonna start season two
of Battlestar Galactica.

80
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:08,795
We already watched
the season two DVDs.

81
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,518
Not with commentary.

82
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,158
I think we should be good neighbors.

83
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,072
lnvite her over. make her feel welcome.

84
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,752
We never invited Louie/Louise over.

85
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,116
Well. and that was wrong of us.

86
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,554
We need to widen our circle.

87
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,632
l have a very wide circle.

88
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:29,757
l have 212 friends on MySpace.

89
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:32,993
Yes. and you've never met one of them.

90
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:34,872
That's the beauty of it.

91
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,957
I'm gonna invite her over.

92
00:04:39,119 --> 00:04:41,713
We'll have a nice meal and chat.

93
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:45,110
Chat? We don't chat.
at least not off-line.

94
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,754
Well. it's not difficult.

95
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,477
You just listen to what she says...

96
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:53,109
...and then you say something
appropriate in response.

97
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,479
To what end?

98
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,549
-Hi. Again.
-Hi.

99
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,915
-Hi.
-Hi.

100
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,559
Anyway...

101
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,678
...we brought home Indian food...

102
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:08,510
...and I know that
moving can be stressful...

103
00:05:08,679 --> 00:05:10,795
...and | find
that when I'm undergoing stress...

104
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,111
...that good food and company can have
a comforting effect.

105
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,908
Also. curry's a natural laxative and
I don't have to tell you that. you know...

106
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,278
...a clean colon is just one less thing
to worry about.

107
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:27,119
I'm no expert.
but in the context of a lunch invitation...

108
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:29,839
...you might wanna skip the reference
to bowel movements.

109
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:32,071
Oh. you're inviting me over to eat?

110
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,068
Yes.

111
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,231
Oh. that's so nice. I'd love to.

112
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:37,388
Great.

113
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,755
So. what do you guys do for fun
around here?

114
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,271
Well. today we tried masturbating
for money.

115
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,237
-Okay. well. make yourself at home.
-Okay.

116
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,710
-Thank you.
-You're very welcome.

117
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,437
[MOUTHS]
You're very welcome.

118
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,592
This looks like some serious stuff.
Leonard. did you do this?

119
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,069
Actually. that's my work.

120
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,589
Wow.

121
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,637
Yeah. well. it's just some
quantum mechanics...

122
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,189
...with a little string theory doodling
around the edges.

123
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,873
That part's just a joke.

124
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,112
It's a spoof of the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation.

125
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:38,355
So you're. like. one of those
Beautiful Mind genius guys.

126
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,833
Yeah.

127
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,994
This is really impressive.

128
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,277
l have a board. if you like boards.
This is my board.

129
00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:48,318
Holy smokes.

130
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,631
If by “holy smokes." you mean
a derivative restatement of the stuff...

131
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:55,030
...you can find scribbled on the wall
of any men's room at MIT. sure.

132
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,953
-What?
-Oh. come on.

133
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,590
Who hasn't seen this differential below
“here I sit brokenhearted“?

134
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,639
I didn't have to invent 26 dimensions
just to make the math come out.

135
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,438
-I didn't invent them. They're there.
-In what universe?

136
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,318
In all of them. that is the point.

137
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:12,037
Do you guys mind if I start?

138
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,792
-Penny.
-Yeah?

139
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,995
That's where I sit.

140
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:18,557
So sit next to me.

141
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,798
-No. I sit there.
-What's the difference?

142
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,428
-What's the difference?
-Here we go.

143
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,672
In winter. that seat is close enough
to the radiator to remain warm...

144
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,956
...yet not so close
as to cause perspiration.

145
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:36,158
In summer. it's in a cross breeze created
by opening windows there and there.

146
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,834
lt faces the television at an angle that is
neither direct...

147
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,228
...discouraging
conversation...

148
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:42,754
...nor so far wide
as to create a parallax distortion.

149
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:46,832
I could go on.
but I think I've made my point.

150
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,314
Do you want me to move?

151
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,232
-We||....
-Just sit somewhere else.

152
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:55,952
Fine.

153
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:14,995
Sheldon. sit.

154
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,479
Ah.

155
00:08:19,239 --> 00:08:22,390
-Well. this is nice.
-We don't have a lot of company over.

156
00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:24,993
That's not true.
Koothrappali and Wolowitz come over.

157
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,149
Yes. I know.

158
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,071
Tuesday night we played Klingon Boggle
until 1 in the morning.

159
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:29,877
-Yeah. I remember.
-I resent you saying...

160
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,393
-...we don't have company.
-Sorry.

161
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:33,993
-That has a negative social implication.
-I said I'm sorry.

162
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,355
So...

163
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:37,838
...Klingon Boggle?

164
00:08:37,999 --> 00:08:42,390
Yeah. It's like regular Boggle.
but in Klingon.

165
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:47,512
That's probably enough about us.
So tell us about you.

166
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,873
Me? Okay.

167
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,476
I'm a Sagittarius. which probably tells
you way more than you need to know.

168
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:56,949
Yes. it tells us that you participate
in the mass cultural delusion...

169
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,032
...that the sun's position relative
to arbitrary constellations...

170
00:09:00,199 --> 00:09:03,350
...at the time of your birth
somehow affects your personality.

171
00:09:05,599 --> 00:09:07,157
Participate in the what?
