00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:20,558
How great this place looks?

345
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:23,228
-Oh. boy. I was afraid of this.
-What?

346
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,834
These instructions
are a pictographic representation...

347
00:18:25,999 --> 00:18:28,672
...of the least imaginative way
to assemble these components.

348
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:31,558
This right here
is why Sweden has no space program.

349
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,792
-It looked pretty good in the store.
-It is an inefficient design.

350
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:37,517
For example.
Penny has a flatscreen TV...

351
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,590
...which means all this space
behind it is wasted.

352
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,320
-We could put her stereo back there.
-And control it how?

353
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,553
Run an infrared repeater.
photocell here. emitter here. easy-peasy.

354
00:18:47,199 --> 00:18:49,508
-Good point. How will you cool it?
-Guys. I got this.

355
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,749
-Hang on. Penny.
-How about fans?

356
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,195
-Here and here.
-A|so inefficient. and might be loud.

357
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,793
How about a liquid cooler?
A little aquarium pump here.

358
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,393
Run some quarter-inch PVC--

359
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:01,311
Guys. this is actually really simple.

360
00:19:01,999 --> 00:19:03,557
Hold on. honey. men at work.

361
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:09,149
PVC comes here. Maybe a little
corrugated sheet metal as radiator here.

362
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:12,629
Show me where we put a drip tray.
a sluice and a overflow reservoir?

363
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,597
If water's involved.
we'll ground the crap out of the thing.

364
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,275
Guys. it's hot in here.
I think I'll just take off all my clothes.

365
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,472
Oh. I've got it.

366
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,711
What if we replaced
panels A. B and F and crossbar H...

367
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,154
...with aircraft-grade aluminum?

368
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:33,230
-Entire thing's one big heat sink.
-Perfect.

369
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,836
Leonard and Sheldon. go to the junkyard
and get 6 square meters of aluminum.

370
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,592
Raj and I
will get the oxyacetylene torch.

371
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,749
-Meet in an hour?
-Done.

372
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,511
Got it.

373
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,475
Okay. this place does look pretty good.
