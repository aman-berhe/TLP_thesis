00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,831
Five. six. seven.

172
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:32,311
I think Mrs. Tishman's
got her eye on you.

173
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,950
I've been there. You're in for a treat.

[SINGING AUGUSTANA'S “BOSTON"l

175
00:09:51,119 --> 00:09:52,108
Oh. good Lord.

176
00:10:02,439 --> 00:10:04,350
God. that's a good song.

177
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,957
If you're compiling a mix CD
for a double suicide.

178
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:12,115
Oh. I hope that scratching post
is for you.

179
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,158
I know what you're thinking.
I've taken your asthma into account.

180
00:10:15,319 --> 00:10:17,230
There's a feline geneticist in San Diego...

181
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,312
...who's developed
the cutest little hypoallergenic calicos.

182
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,277
-Listen--
-|'ve been thinking about names.

183
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:26,751
I'm kind of torn between Einstein.
Newton and Sergeant Fuzzy Boots.

184
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,913
Do you think you can satisfy
your need for a relationship...

185
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,196
...with a genetically-altered cat?

186
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,035
Maybe. if it's a cute little cuddly cat.

187
00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:38,633
Oh. come on. Leonard....

188
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,958
This is obviously about Penny.

189
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,479
It doesn't matter.

190
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:48,437
The woman's not interested in me.
The woman rejected me.

191
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,875
Okay. look. Ahem.

192
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:54,915
You have as much of a chance of having
a sexual relationship with Penny...

193
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,991
...as the Hubble telescope does
of discovering...

194
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,593
...at the center of a black hole...

195
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:01,990
...is a little man with a flashlight
searching for a circuit breaker.

196
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:09,069
Nevertheless. I do feel obligated
to point out to you...

197
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,196
...that she did not reject you.

198
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:13,197
You did not ask her out.

199
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:16,038
You're right.

200
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:18,191
I didn't ask her. I should ask her out.

201
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,476
No. no. no. That was not my point.

202
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:23,718
My point was. don't buy a cat.

203
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:25,790
No. but you're right.

204
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,030
I should march over there
and ask her out.

205
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:31,471
Oh. goody. we're getting a cat.

206
00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:35,230
Oh. yeah-- No.

207
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,197
-Oh. hey. Leonard.
-Good afternoon. Penny.

208
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,635
So. hi. hey. Uh....

209
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,631
l was wondering
if you had plans for dinner.

210
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,119
Uh. you mean. dinner tonight?

211
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:51,027
There is an inherent ambiguity
in the word “dinner.“

212
00:11:51,199 --> 00:11:53,952
Technically.
it refers to the largest meal of the day.

213
00:11:54,119 --> 00:11:56,508
So to clarify here.
by dinner. I mean supper.

214
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:58,597
-Supper?
-Or dinner. you know.

215
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:02,347
l was thinking 6:30 if you can go.
or a different time.

216
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:03,634
Uh. 6:30 is great.

217
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,199
ReaHy?

218
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,150
-Great.
-Yeah. I like hanging out with you guys.

219
00:12:09,319 --> 00:12:10,308
Us guys?

220
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,233
Oh. you know. Sheldon. Howard. Raj.
Who all is coming?

221
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,599
They...

222
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,594
...might all be there.

223
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,280
Or a subset of them might be there.

224
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:24,634
Algebraically speaking.
there are too many unknowns.

225
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,711
For example.
Sheldon had Ouizno's for lunch.

226
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,313
Sometimes he finds that filling.
other times he doesn't.

227
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,677
It's no fault of Ouizno's.
They have a varied menu.

228
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,718
Okay. whatever. it sounds like fun.

229
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:37,758
Great.

230
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,353
-Did we say a time?
-Six-thirty.

231
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,509
Still good?

232
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:42,271
-|t's fine.
-|t's not carved in stone.

233
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:43,633
No. Six-thirty is great.

234
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,791
I'll get my chisel. Heh-heh.

235
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,392
Why?

236
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:54,239
To carve the--
Okay. I'll see you at 6:30.

237
00:13:04,439 --> 00:13:06,191
How do I look?

238
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:12,191
Could you be more specific?

239
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,149
Can you tell I'm perspiring a little?

240
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,192
No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns
under your arms conceal it nicely.

241
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,078
-What time is your date?
-Six-thirty.

242
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,554
Perfect. that gives you
two hours and 15 minutes...

243
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,757
...for that dense molecular cloud
of Aramis to dissipate.

244
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,917
-|s it too much?
-Not if you're a rugby team.

245
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,353
By the way. you didn't join us
because you stuffed yourself...

246
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,636
...with a chicken carbonara sub
at Ouizno's.

247
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,149
Why would I join you?

248
00:13:44,119 --> 00:13:45,552
No reason.

249
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:50,188
Oh. you know what?
Maybe this isn't such a good idea.

250
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,669
Oh, no, well. now.
there's always the possibility...

251
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:54,909
...that alcohol and poor judgment
on her part...

252
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,355
...might lead to a nice romantic evening.

253
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:01,956
You're right. Alcohol. poor judgment.
It could go well.

254
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:05,471
Of course. there's the other possibility
that this day kicks off...

255
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:08,597
...an unpleasant six months of you
passing awkwardly in the hall...

256
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:11,512
...until one of you breaks down
and moves to another zip code.

257
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,832
You could have stopped at.
“It could go well.“

258
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,356
If I could have. I would have.

259
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:20,227
I mean. I'm a perfectly nice guy.
There's no reason...

260
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,073
...we couldn't go to the restaurant
and have a lovely dinner.

261
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,711
Maybe take a walk afterwards.
talk about things we have in common.

262
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,553
“You love pottery? I love pottery.“

263
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,474
You know. there's a pause.
We both know what's happening.

264
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,551
We kiss. It's a little tentative at first.

265
00:14:35,719 --> 00:14:38,597
But I realize. she's kissing me back.
she's biting my lower lip.

266
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:40,795
She wants me.
This thing is going the distance.

267
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,871
We're gonna have sex.
Oh. God. oh. my God.

268
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,994
Is the sex starting now?

269
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,954
I'm having a panic attack.

270
00:14:50,119 --> 00:14:53,316
Oh. okay. Well. then. calm down.

271
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,277
If I could.
I wouldn't be having an attack.

272
00:14:55,439 --> 00:14:57,748
-That's why they call it a panic attack.
-All right.

273
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,399
Would you just sit down?

274
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:02,027
-Yeah. sit down. Now close your eyes.
-Why?

275
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,349
-We|l. just do it.
-Okay.

276
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,398
Now. try to increase
your alpha-wave activity.

277
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:09,198
-What?
-|t's a biofeedback technique.

278
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,396
lt's relaxation
through brainwave manipulation.

279
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:13,629
| read it
in Journal a! American Neuroscience.

280
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,394
It was sparsely sourced.
but I think the science is valid.

281
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:19,027
I probably have it here somewhere.

282
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,236
Who am I kidding?
lcan't go through with this.

283
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,072
-You need to call her and cancel.
-Me?

284
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,673
-Yes.
-What should I tell her?

285
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,149
-I don't know. Tell her I'm sick.
-Okay.

286
00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:29,753
Not the kind that would make her
wanna take care of me.

287
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,959
But nothing so critical that she'll feel
uncomfortable if I wanna try this again.

288
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,509
Got it. So I'm assuming
nothing venereal.

289
00:15:40,999 --> 00:15:43,467
I'll just tell her that you had
a routine colonoscopy...

290
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:45,391
...and haven't quite bounced back.

291
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:47,868
-Give me the phone.
-I thought you wanted to cancel.

292
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:50,712
lcan't. If I don't show up.
she'll still be expecting you.

293
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,152
Why would she be expecting me?

294
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:57,998
Stop asking me all these questions.
I need to take another shower.

295
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,997
Are the rest of the guys
meeting us here?

296
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,116
Oh. yeah. No.

297
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:07,590
Turns out that Raj and Howard
had to work...

298
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:12,992
...and Sheldon had a colonoscopy.
and he hasn't quite bounced back yet.

299
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,110
Ooh. my uncle just had
a colonoscopy.

300
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:20,192
You're kidding. Well. then.
that's something we have in common.

301
00:16:20,719 --> 00:16:22,357
How?

302
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:28,754
We both have people in our lives who
wanna nip intestinal polyps in the bud.

303
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,390
So. what's new in the world of physics?

304
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,959
Nothing.

305
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,273
Really? Nothing?

306
00:16:41,439 --> 00:16:44,078
Well. with the exception
of string theory...

307
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,708
...not much has happened
since the 1930s...

308
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,518
...and you can't prove string theory.

309
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:53,912
At best you can say. "Hey. look. my idea
has an internal logical consistency.“

310
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,515
Ah. Well. I'm sure things will pick up.

311
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:04,350
What's new at the Cheesecake Factory?

312
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,875
Oh. uh. not much.

313
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,237
Oh. we do have a chocolate key lime
that's moving pretty well.

314
00:17:11,399 --> 00:17:12,878
Good.

315
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,713
Good.

316
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,513
Uh. what about
your. uh. hallway friend?

317
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,912
Doug? Oh. yeah. I don't know. I mean.
you know. he's nice and funny. but--

318
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,229
-Can I get you started with some drinks?
-No. Bzzz.

319
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,516
-You were saying. “But....“?
-|'d like a drink.

320
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,797
Just say the “but“ thing about Doug.
and then I'll get her back.

321
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:38,118
Okay. well. it--
ldon't know. It's just me.

322
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:40,349
I'm still getting over this break-up
with Kurt.

323
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,193
And this thing with Doug
would just be rebound sex.

324
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,759
Ugh. Don't get me started
on rebound sex.

325
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,519
It's just-- It's my pattern.

326
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,796
I break up. then I find some cute guy...

327
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,555
...and then it's just
36 meaningless hours of....

328
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,869
You know.

329
00:17:58,839 --> 00:18:00,192
I'm not sure that I do. Um....

330
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,110
Is that one 36-hour experience
or is that 36 hours spread out over...

331
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:09,635
...say. one glorious summer?

332
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:11,198
No. It's usually over a weekend.

333
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:13,998
And trust me.
you do not feel good after it.

334
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:16,509
Well. chafing. right?

335
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,629
Emotionally.

336
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,597
Of course. yeah. Emotional chafing.

337
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,430
Hey. do you wanna see something cool?

338
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,839
I can make this olive go into this glass
without touching it.

339
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,594
-How?
-Physics.

340
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,796
Wow. centrifugal force.

341
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,157
Actually. it's centripetal force.
which is an inward force...

342
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,471
...generated by the glass
acting on the olive. Ooh.

343
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:54,473
Excuse me.

344
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,632
Now. if you were biting on the olive...

345
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:01,189
...you'd be on a non-inertial
reference frame and would--

346
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,631
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. I'm okay.

347
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:07,712
Did you spill ketchup?

348
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,110
-No.
-|'m not okay.

349
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,272
You don't wanna go
to the emergency room?

350
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,429
No. no. I'm okay.

351
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:17,952
lt's stopped bleeding.

352
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,953
Anyway. you did throw up.
Isn't that a sign of a concussion?

353
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,237
Yes. but I get carsick too. so....

354
00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:25,388
Okay.

355
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,198
Sorry about your car. by the way.

356
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,830
Oh. no. it's fine.
You got most of it out the window.

357
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,237
The poor guy on the bike.

358
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,869
I had a nice time.

359
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,878
Yeah. me too.

360
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,147
Well. um. good night.

361
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,114
Good night.

362
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:45,637
-Leonard.
-Yeah?

363
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,555
Was this supposed to be a date?

364
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,912
This?

365
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,391
No.

366
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:55,592
No. of course not.

367
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:58,831
This was just you and me hanging out
with guys who didn't show up...

368
00:19:58,999 --> 00:20:01,991
...because of work and a colonoscopy.

369
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:04,712
Okay. I was just checking.

370
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,072
When I take a girl on a date.
and I do. heh...

371
00:20:11,439 --> 00:20:13,270
...she knows she's been dated.

372
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,831
Capital D. Heh.

373
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,597
Bold face. underlined. like. dated.

374
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,239
I think I might have a concussion.
I'm gonna go lay down.

375
00:20:25,399 --> 00:20:26,798
Good night.

376
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,437
-So how was your date?
-Awesome. Heh.

377
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,392
Score one for liquor and poor judgment.
