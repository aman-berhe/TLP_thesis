Okay. Raj. here you go.

170
00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:46,473
All right. Who's next?

171
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,279
I'd like to try a Slippery Nipple.

172
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,790
Okay. you're cut off.

173
00:08:57,359 --> 00:08:58,678
Anybody need a refill?

174

Where did my life go. Penny?

00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,750
Is there another Penny here?

179
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,274
I had such plans. I had dreams.

180
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,671
I was going to be the Indira Gandhi

181

But with a penis. of course.

182
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:27,788
It's amazing.

183
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:29,358
Ever since I was a little boy...

184
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,272
...my father wanted me
to be a gynecologist like him.

185
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,228
How can I be a gynecologist?
I can barely look a woman in the eye.

186
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:42,796
You know what? I'm not going
to let my parents control my future.

187
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,358
It's time for a showdown.

192
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,591

Haven't you been listening?
I cannot talk to women.

-No. no. let's see how long it takes him.

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,269
...you say you can't talk to women
but you've been talking to me.

199
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,510
And now we'll never know.

200
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,747
You're right. I--

201
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,319
I am talking to you.

202
00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:24,713
Hello. Penny. How are you?

203
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,354
I'm fine.

204
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:28,714
Okay. now. I need to
make sure I have a Lalita...

205
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:30,790

206
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,516
It's a sweet green miracle.

00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:39,876
If you're gonna drink on this date.
just promise me you won't overdo it.

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,514
Overdo what?

everything's going to be hunky dunky?

00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:52,107
Yeah. that.

213
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:55,396
Why don't you bring her to my restaurant
so I can keep an eye on you?

214
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,118
Okay.

215
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,197
What's the plan? Let's say he meets her.
he likes her. they get married.

216
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,079
What's he gonna do.
stay drunk for the rest of his life?

00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,118
Well. you are.

00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,271
Little Lalita.

222
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,919
That's kind of fun to say.

-You should try it.
-Oh. it's okay.

225
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,196
You have lost so much weight.

226
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,670
That must have been difficult for you
because you were so. so fat.

227

Do you remember?

00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:46,756
-Yes. I do.
-Of course you do.

229
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,559

Mm! Are you aware that dentists
have an extremely high suicide rate?

Not as high as air traffic controllers.

I'm pretty sure her name's Lalita.

No. no. Princess Panchali

Oh. no. it isn't.

It's about an Indian princess
who befriends a monkey...

256
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:16,077
...who was mocked by the other monkeys
because he was different.

257
00:13:16,239 --> 00:13:19,276
For some reason.
I related to it quite strongly.

I imagine you smell very nice too.

So. Sheldon. tell me more about
this princess you say I look like.

289
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:51,518
It was said that the gods
fashioned her eyes out of the stars...

290
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:55,513
...and that roses were ashamed to bloom
in the presence of her ruby lips.

was to get my parents off my case.

I don't need to be getting
this old-world crap from you.

But you're not Princess Panchali.
