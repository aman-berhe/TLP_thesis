to be fighting with your best friend.

Oh. I hadn't thought about it like that.

194
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:09,551
I wonder if I've been experiencing
physiological manifestations...

of unconscious emotional turmoil.

should talk to him.

I know Leonard values you as a friend.

203
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,917
He told me without your little idea...

204
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,389
...there was no way he could've come
up with this whole experiment thing.

205

Excuse me. Little idea?

206
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,152
Yeah. he tried to explain it to me.
I didn't really understand it--

207
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,153
Of course you didn't.
He said “little idea“?

Oh. Well. no.

In what words. then. exactly?

Instead of arguing about this. why--?
