out you had lied...

172
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,714
...so she's agreed to operate
as if the original lie is still in force.

173
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,990
So she's expecting me to lie about going
to a symposium in Pasadena...

174
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:32,949
...when in actuality. we're pretending to
go to a drug intervention in Long Beach.

00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:34,872
Un-unravelable.

176
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:42,032
Oh, hey, Penny. Wow. look at you.
all ready for your showcase.

Oh.

180
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:52,274
-Well. thank you.
-You know. I gotta tell you.

181
00:09:52,439 --> 00:09:55,511
A lot of friends would let their friend
go alone. but that's not you.

182
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,228
You are the kind of guy
who stands by a friend when....

183
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,198
When he has a symposium to go to.

184
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,350
I don't know what to say.

-Oh. okay. all right. good.

-Oh. boy. group hug.
-Uh-uh.

187

-Uh-uh?
-Okay. So. what's up?

188
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:21,598
Penny is on her way to perform a one-
night showcase production of Rent...

189
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:24,910
...which we are unable to attend.
because we're going to a symposium...

190
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,278
...on molecular positronium
given by Dr. Emil Farmanfarmian.

191
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,752
Wait. Farmanfarmian is speaking
and you're bogarting the symposium?

192
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,270
-Howard. I'm sorry. we would've--
-No. no. you're quark-blocking us.

-Howard--
-|t's your Millennium Falcon...

...you and Chewbacca do
whatever you wanna do.

197
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,636
Me and Princess Leia here will find
some other way to spend the evening.

198
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,391
Howard. wait.

199
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:57,471
Sheldon. I think we should tell them.

200
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,874
Okay. sure.

201
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:01,552
I don't see a problem with that.

202
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:04,750
There's no symposium.

203
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:06,910
Leonard lied to me.
Isn't that right. Leonard?

204
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,513
Well....

205
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,510
-I don't know what to say.
-|t's okay. I do.

206
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:15,193
Look. Leonard is helping Sheldon
through a family crisis.

207
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:19,830
He made up the whole story about
the symposium with Dr. Farmanfarmian--

208
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,989
-Good for you.
-Ha! Yeah.

209
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:24,277
He didn't want Sheldon
to be embarrassed.

210
00:11:24,439 --> 00:11:26,350
There's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

211
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,351
Every family in America has a relative...

212
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:31,511
...holed up in a garage somewhere
huffing paint thinner.

213
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,998
No. I'm lost too.
I think she skipped a step.

214
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:38,227
Now. look. Sheldon's cousin Leo
escaped rehab...

215
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,992
...and he's in a Motel 8 in Long Beach.

216
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,310
The whole family's going out
for an intervention.

217
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:45,073
Leonard is driving Sheldon down
to help him through this...

218
00:11:45,239 --> 00:11:48,914
-...because he's such a good man.
-Oh. another hug? Thank you.

219
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,709
-All right. you guys. Good luck.
-Thanks. Penny.

-Yeah. break a leg.

So road trip to Long Beach.

222
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:59,834
-We're not going to Long Beach.
-Why not?

223
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:02,911
Because Sheldon doesn't have
a drug-addicted cousin Leopold.

224
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:04,797
Oh. too bad.

225
00:12:05,479 --> 00:12:07,674
I've always wanted to go to Long Beach.

226
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,513
It's a very nice community.
The Queen Mary is docked there.

227
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:13,910
Once the largest liner in the world.
it's now a hotel and restaurant...

228
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,958
...where they host a surprisingly gripping
murder-mystery dinner.

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:18,828
-Sounds fun.
-|'m game.

-Shotgun.
-No. no. no.

231
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:25,075
Leonard gets nauseous unless
he sits in front. and even then it's iffy.

232
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:30,075
Wait. are we really going to Long Beach?

Let it go. Sheldon.

The murderer was the first mate

No. that's the least of our worries.

00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:49,431
I've been doing research on addiction...

...both the biochemical
and behavioral aspects...

with the current version of our lie.

It's fine. she bought it. it's over.

Sadly. it's not.

Substance abuse is a lifelong struggle.

But beyond that.
l have realized the Leo I described...

245
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,112
...would not have agreed
to go to rehab.

246
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,111
Why not?

247
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,633
Because Leo's a middle child.

There's no Leo. How can you say that?

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,028
You didn't read the bio. did you?

250
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,158
He's not just a middle child.
he is the quintessential middle child.

From a broken home. to boot.
Psychologically speaking...

...the attention he gets by rebelling.
even to the point of destruction...

253
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,353

than help he would get at rehab.

As a result. I've often felt like
an outsider. never really fitting in...

for my substance-abuse problem.

You see. while Leo would not
have gone into rehab...
