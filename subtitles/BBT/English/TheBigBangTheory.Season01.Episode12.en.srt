1
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,718
Here's the problem with teleportation.

2
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:13,190
Lay it on me.

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,078
Assuming a device could be invented...

4
00:00:15,239 --> 00:00:18,754
...which would identify the state of
matter of an individual in one location...

5
00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:21,638
...and transmit that to a distant location
for reassembly...

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,950
...you wouldn't have
transported the individual...

7
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:29,034
...you would have destroyed him in one
location and re-created him in another.

8
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:32,115
How about that.

9
00:00:32,879 --> 00:00:34,437
I would never use a transporter.

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,160
The original Sheldon
would have to be disintegrated...

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,959
...in order to create a new Sheldon.

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,313
Would the new Sheldon be in any way
an improvement on the old Sheldon?

13
00:00:45,199 --> 00:00:47,394
No. he would be exactly the same.

14
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,357
That is a problem.

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,714
So you see it too?

16
00:00:51,639 --> 00:00:53,675
Dr. Hofstadter. Dr. Cooper.

17
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,989
Dr. Gablehauser.

18
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,435
Gentlemen.
I'd like you to meet Dennis Kim.

19
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:00,318
Dennis is a highly sought-after
doctoral candidate.

20
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:02,515
We're hoping to have him
do graduate work here.

21
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,797
-Graduate work. very impressive.
-And he's only 15 years old.

22
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:09,668
Not bad.
I myself started graduate school at 14.

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,196
Well. I lost a year while my family
was tunneling out of North Korea.

24
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,152
Advantage. Kim.

25
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:20,670
I thought maybe you
could show Dennis around.

26
00:01:20,839 --> 00:01:24,036
Let him see why we're the best
physics research facility in the country.

27
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,189
I know you're not.

28
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,557
You don't have an Open Science Grid
computer or a free electron laser.

29
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,188
The string theory research
being done is a dead end.

30
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,909
Excuse me. that is my research.
and it is by no means a dead end.

31
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,992
Well. obviously. you don't see it yet.
but trust me. you will.

32
00:01:40,679 --> 00:01:42,192
Dennis. we've discussed this.

33
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:44,634
We're in the process
of updating our equipment.

34
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,869
We welcome your input
on our research goals.

35
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,474
We agree to look the other way
if you use 20 percent...

36
00:01:49,639 --> 00:01:52,870
...of the money you attract to smuggle
your grandfather out of Pyongyang.

37
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,515
We want him here. boys.

38
00:01:56,679 --> 00:01:58,112
-Make it happen.
-Yes. sir.

39
00:01:58,279 --> 00:02:00,031
You can count on us. We're on it.

40
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,395
What the hell do you mean. “dead end“?

41
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,632
I mean. the whole landscape
of false vacuums in string theory...

42
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:08,029
...could be as large
as 10 to the 500th power.

43
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,189
In addition--

44
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,634
Ooh. look. chocolate milk.

45
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:16,317
I sense a disturbance in the force.

46
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,630
[IMITATING YODA]
A bad feeling I have about this. Mm.

47
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:45,477
So how long have you been in America?

48
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,039
-A year and a half.
-No kidding.

49
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,272
-You speak English really well.
-So do you.

50
00:02:50,679 --> 00:02:54,911
Except for your tendency
to end sentences with prepositions.

51
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,350
What are you talking about?

52
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,271
That.

53
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,868
He's not wrong.

54
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,029
All right. and this is my office.

55
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,509
-|s this part of the tour?
-Nope. Goodbye.

56
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,516
Sheldon.
we've hardly shown him anything.

57
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,150
All right. this is my desk.
These are my books.

58
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,992
This is my door.
Please close it behind you. goodbye.

59
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:21,309

in quantum loop corrections.

60

Keen observation. goodbye.

61
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,634
You see where you
went wrong. don't you?

62
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,028
-Leonard.
-Ha.

63
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,919
-Yeah?
-Get him out.

64
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:34,631
Come. I'll show you the rec center.
They've got Nautilus equipment.

65
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,518

66
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,955
Not heavy ones.

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,831
...a Lorentz invariant
or field theory approach.

69
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,278
You think I haven't considered it?

70
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:49,556
-You really think I haven't considered it?
-Have you considered it?

71
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,191
-Get him out. Leonard.
-Come on. Dennis.

72
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:56,032
I'll show you the radiation lab.

73
00:03:56,359 --> 00:03:58,395
Wow. You won the Stevenson Award?

74
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,469
Yes. In fact.
I am the youngest person ever to win it.

75
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,876
Really? How old?

76
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,314
Fourteen and a half.

77
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,516
Mm. You were the youngest
ever to win it.

78
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,555
It's like looking
into an obnoxious mirror. isn't it?

79
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,195
Mm. This is really delicious. isn't it?

80
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,311
Still can't talk to me
unless you're drunk. huh?

81
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,233
Oh. sweetie. you are so damaged.

82
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,720
Hey. I'm damaged too.

83
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,155
How about a hug for Howie?

84
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:42,391
Sure. Raj. hug Howard.

[SHELDON SIGHS]

86
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,873
Something you'd like to share?

87
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,155
A tale of woe perhaps?

88
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:52,913
Fifteen years old.

89
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,755
Dennis Kim is 15 years old
and he's already correcting my work.

90
00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:00,628
Today. I went from being
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart to....

91
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,152
You know. that other guy.

92
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,388

93
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,759
Oh. God.
now even you're smarter than me.

94
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,910
You know. you don't have
so many friends...

95
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:12,115
...that you can afford
to start insulting them.

96
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,996
Just eat. Sheldon. You'll feel better.

97
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,354
Why waste food?

98
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,794
When a cow goes dry.
they don't keep feeding it...

99

...they just take her out
and shoot her between the eyes.

100
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:26,188
I'm confused.
Did Sheldon stop giving milk?

101
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:28,557
You can't let this kid get to you.

102
00:05:28,719 --> 00:05:32,029
You knew that someday. someone would
come along who's younger and smarter.

103
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,760
Yes. but I assumed
I would've been dead hundreds of years.

104
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:38,309
And that there'd be an asterisk
by his name because he'd be a cyborg.

00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,791
So you got a little competition.
I really don't see what the big deal is.

106
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,918
Of course you don't.
You've never excelled at anything.

107
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,429
I don't understand. exactly how did
he get any friends in the first place?

108
00:05:52,239 --> 00:05:54,434
We liked Leonard.

109
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,798
What are you gonna do. just give up?

110
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,510
Yes. it's what
a rational person does...

111
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,830
...when his entire
life's work is invalidated...

00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,673
...by a postpubescent Asian wunderkind.

113

He ceases his fruitless efforts. he
donates his body to scientific research...

114
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:13,193
...and he waits to die.

115
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,995
I'm confused again. Is he waiting. or do
we get to shoot him between the eyes?

-Hey.
-Hey.

-My career is not over.
-Great.

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,032
But since Dennis Kim
has rendered my research pointless...

So. what exactly is it you do?

I know you chatter on about it all the
time. but I've never really paid attention.

00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:51,591
Right now. I'm designing an experiment
to study the soft component...

Oh. sure you do.

00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,520
Now see. what's this here
in the schematic. a laser array?

130
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,318
-Yes.
-Now. hmm....

131
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:07,431
What happens if you use argon lasers
instead of helium-neon?

132
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:09,830
-It would blow up.
-Are you sure?

133
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,708
-Pretty sure.
-“Pretty sure“ is not very scientific.

134
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,509
Is this how you normally work?
Just hunches and guesses and stuff?

-All right.
-Go away.

For three years.
you've never come by to say hello.

155
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:24,708
Well. up until now.
I've had better things to do.

156
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,670
So. what are we making today?

157
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,796
A small payload
support structure...

158
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,076
...for a European science
experimental package...

159
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,832
...that's going up
on the next space shuttle.

160
00:08:33,999 --> 00:08:35,432
Really? How does it work?

161
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,636
It will be attached to the payload bay...

162
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,236
...and the sensor apparatus
will rest on it.

163
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,789
Ah-ha.

164
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,629
So it's a shelf.

165
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:49,634
No. you don't understand.

166
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,951
During acceleration. it needs
to stay perfectly level and provide--

167
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:54,472
Yeah. okay. it's a shelf.

168
00:08:55,199 --> 00:08:56,678
I notice you're using titanium.

169
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,070
Did you give any consideration
to carbon nanotubes?

170
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,073
They're lighter. cheaper

00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:48,395
-He's back.
-Yeah. mission accomplished.

339
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,632
Forget the mission. How did that
little yutz get a girl on his own?

340
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:54,475
I guess times have changed
since we were young.

341
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,631
Smart is the new sexy.

342
00:17:57,399 --> 00:18:00,277
Then why do we go home alone
every night? We're still smart.

343
00:18:00,719 --> 00:18:02,232
Maybe we're too smart.

344
00:18:02,399 --> 00:18:04,117
So smart. it's off-putting.

345
00:18:05,399 --> 00:18:07,788
Yeah. let's go with that.

346
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,589
Unbelievable.

347
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,228
Components I built
are on the space station...

348
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:18,038
...and | get a ticket
for launching a rocket in the park.

349
00:18:18,199 --> 00:18:20,429
I don't know if the ticket
was so much for the launch...

350
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,953
...as for telling the policewoman:

351
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,271
“You have to frisk me.
l have another rocket in my pants.“

352
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:27,357
Hey. look at that.

353
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,990
lt's Dennis Kim.

354
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:33,468
Wow. I almost didn't recognize him.

355
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,551
I kind of feel bad
about what we did to him.

356
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,599
Yeah. we really ruined his life.

357
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,279
Screw him. he was weak.
