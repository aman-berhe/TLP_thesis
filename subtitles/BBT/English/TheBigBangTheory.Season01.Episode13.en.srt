00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,669
So?

169
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:56,235
So nothing. Let's destroy him.

170
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,913
SHELDON:
Gentlemen.

171
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:01,309
RAJESH:
Hee-hee-hee!

172
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:08,627
Okay. we're gonna need a strong fourth
for our team.

173
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,428
You know who is apparently very smart
is the girl who played TV's Blossom.

174
00:09:13,879 --> 00:09:16,188
She got a Ph.D. in neuroscience
or something.

175
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,319
Raj. we're not getting TV's Blossom
to join our Physics Bowl team.

176
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,230
How about the girl from
The Wonder Years?

177
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,395
Gentlemen. I believe I've found
the solution to all our problems.

178
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,318
We can't ask Leslie Winkle.

179
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,038
Why? Because you slept together...

180
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,829
...and when she was done with you. she
discarded you like last night's chutney?

181
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,833
Yes.

182
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,348
-You gotta take one for the team.
-Yeah. Sack up. dude.

183
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:51,232
Fine.

184
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,668
Here | go. taking one for the team...

185
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,796
...in the sack.

186
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:01,149
-Hey. Leslie.
-Hi. guys.

187
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,550
Ahem. So. Leslie.
l have a question for you...

188
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,633
...and it might be a little awkward.
you know. given that l--

189
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,916
Hit that thing.

190
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,029
There's no reason to feel uncomfortable
because we've seen each other's faces...

191
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,556
...and naked bodies contorted
in the sweet agony of coitus.

192
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:24,668
There's not? Gee. because it sure
sounds like there should be.

193
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,109
Any aspects of our sexual relationship.
regarding your preferences...

194
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,556
...your idiosyncrasies. your performance.
are protected by the inherent...

195
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,712
-...confidentia|ity of the bedroom.
-That's all very comforting...

196
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:37,631
...but I'd like to get on
my question now.

197
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,240
-Proceed.
-We are entering the Physics Bowl...

198
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,391
-...and we need a fourth.
-No. thanks.

199
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,597
I'm really busy with my like-sign dilepton
supersymmetry search.

200
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:49,557
Dilepton shmylepton. we need you.

201
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,395
Sorry.

202
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,793
Well. we tried.

203
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:58,111
We'll just have to face Sheldon
manu y manu y menu a manu.

204
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,475
Wait. you're going up against
Sheldon Cooper?

205
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:03,870
-Yes.
-That arrogant. misogynistic doorknob...

206
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,873
...that told me I should abandon
my work with high-energy particles...

207
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,157
...for laundry and childbearing?

208
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,918
She's in.

209
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,792
PENNY:
So how do you feel?

210
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:20,837
Nice and loose? Come to play?
Got your game face on?

211
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,918
-Are you ready?
ALL: Oh.

212
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,752
Yeah. You don't have to stay
for the whole thing.

213
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,513
Oh. no. no. I want to.
Sounds really interesting.

214
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,669
Okay.

215
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,639
-Gent|emen.
-She|don.

216
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,792
-She|don.
-Hee-hee-hee.

217
00:11:42,199 --> 00:11:43,871
Sheldon.

218
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,231
I'm just gonna sit down.

219
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:52,317
So is that your team?

220
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,999
Actually. I don't need a team.

221
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:57,947
I could easily defeat you single-handedly.
but the rules require four.

222
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:02,272
So may I introduce the third-floor janitor.
the lady from the lunch room and--

223
00:12:02,439 --> 00:12:06,148
My Spanish is not good.
--either her son or her butcher.

224
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:07,953
And what about your team?

225
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,032
What rat have you recruited
to the SS. Sinking Ship?

226
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,156
LESLIE:
Hello. Sheldon.

227
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,709
Leslie Winkle.

228
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:19,268
Yeah. Leslie Winkle.
The answer to the question:

229
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,079
“Who made Sheldon Cooper cry
like a little girl?“

230
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,959
Yes. well. I'm polymerized tree sap.
and you're an inorganic adhesive.

231
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,749
So whatever verbal projectile you launch
in my direction is reflected off of me...

232
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,037
...returns on its original trajectory.
and adheres to you.

233
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:36,875
Oh. ouch.

234
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,880
Okay. if everyone could please
take your seats?

235
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,357
Here's your T-shirt.

236
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,639
PMS?

237
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,756
It's a couple days early.

238
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,399
No.

239
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,154
It stands for Perpetual Motion Squad.

240
00:13:00,319 --> 00:13:02,230
Oh. right. of course.
What was I thinking?

241
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:09,034
Good afternoon. everyone. and
welcome to this year's Physics Bowl.

242
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,636
Today's preliminary match
features two great teams:

243
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:18,755
AA versus PMS.

244
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,831
All night long. y'all.

245
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,112
Okay. well. let's jump right in.
First question.

246
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:33,400
For 10 points. “What is the isospin
singlet partner of the pi-zero meson?“

247
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,595
[BUZZER SOUNDS]

248
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:36,511
-PMS?
-The eta meson.

249
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,908
Correct.

250
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,233
-Formal protest.
-On what grounds?

251
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,392
The Velcro on my wrist brace
caught on my shirt.

252
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,393
Denied. All right. for 10 points.

253
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,269
“What is the lightest element on Earth
with no stable isotope?“

[BUZZER SOUNDS]

255
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,671
-AA?
-Of course. the answer is technetium.

256
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,512
Terrific.

257
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:00,275
Next question. “What is the force
between two uncharged plates...

258
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,191
...due to quantum vacuum fluctuation?“

259
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,349
[BUZZER SOUNDS]

260
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,191
-PMS?
-And Sheldon can suck on...

261
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,157
-...the Casimir effect.
GABLEHAUSER: Correct.

262
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,119
“How does a quantum computer
factor large numbers?“

263
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,268
[BUZZER SOUNDS]

264
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,953
-PMS?
-Shor's algorithm.

265
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,109
GABLEHAUSER:
Correct.

266
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,156
Four-point-one-eight-five-five times 10
to the seventh ergs per calorie.

267
00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:28,196
Prévost's theory of exchanges.

268
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,590
Lambda equals one over pi-R-squared N.

269
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:32,511
Seven hundred and sixty degrees Celsius.

270
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,638
The approximate temperature
of the young lady in the front row.

271
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,516
Mr. Wolowitz.
this is your second warning.

272
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,474
A sigma particle.

273
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,871
Yes. assuming the hypothetical planet
has a mass greater than the Earth.

274
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:46,597
GABLEHAUSER:
Correct.

275
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:54,788
Ladies and gentlemen.
I hold in my hand the final question.

276
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:01,909
The score now stands.
AA. 1150. PMS. 1175.

277
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,276
So for 100 points and the match...

278
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:09,751
...please turn your attention
to the formula on the screens.

279
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,558
Solve the equation.

280
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,998
Holy crap.

281
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,515
What the hell is that?

282
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,195
It looks like something they found
on the ship at Roswell.

283
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:24,874
-Come on. think. Leslie?
-|t's not gonna work if you rush me.

284
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,669
-You have to let me get there.
-You're never gonna let that go. are you?

285
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:30,033
Ten seconds.

286
00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:34,308
[BUZZER SOUNDS]

287
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,754
PMS?

288
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,831
Sorry. I panicked.

289
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,829
Then guess.

290
00:15:40,999 --> 00:15:42,591
Um....

291
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,112
Eight.

292
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,994
Point four.

293
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,316
I'm sorry. that's incorrect.

294
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,268
AA. if you can answer correctly.
the match is yours.

00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,432
He doesn't have it. He's got squat.

[BUZZER SOUNDS]

298
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,390
The answer is minus eight pi alpha.

299
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,391
Hang on a second.
That's not our answer.

300
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,437
-What are you doing?
-Answering question.

302
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,031
How do you know anything
about physics?

Here. I am janitor.
ln former Soviet Union. I am physicist.

That's a delightful little story.

307

Our arrangement was
you sit and not say anything.

308
00:16:43,599 --> 00:16:46,033
-I answer the questions.
-You didn't answer question.

309
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,317

now in your beloved Russia...

-Then what is it?

-I want a different question.
-You can't.

-No. l decline to provide one.

319

That's too bad because the answer
your teammate gave was correct.

320
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,949
That's your opinion.

...that you would rather lose by yourself
than win as part of a team?
