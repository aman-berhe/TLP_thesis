Leonard. it's 2 in the morning.

164
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,075
-So?
-So it's my turn.

165
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:08,878
Why'd you set it
for the day before yesterday?

166
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:12,475
Because I wanna go back and keep
myself from getting a time machine.

167
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:15,836
You can't. If you were to prevent
yourself from buying it in the past...

168
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,912
...you would not have it available
to stop yourself from buying it.

169
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:20,353
Ergo. you would still have it.

170
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:23,158
This is a classic
rookie time-travel mistake.

171
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,956
Can I go back and prevent you
from explaining that to me?

172
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,429
Same paradox.

173
00:10:30,599 --> 00:10:33,397
If you were to travel back in time
and knock me unconscious...

174
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:35,993
...you would not have the conversation
motivating you...

175
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:38,389
...to go back and knock me unconscious.

176
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:41,914
What if I knocked you unconscious
right now?

177
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,396
It won't change the past.

178
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,108

181

Well. it was a number of things.
First. the late hour.

182

seems very low-energy.

who own time machines.

Your inability
to successfully woo Penny...

195

of the time machine.

-In addition. your premise is flawed.
