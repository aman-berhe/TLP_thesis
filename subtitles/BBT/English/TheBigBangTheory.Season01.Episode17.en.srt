That's what you did.

7
00:00:17,599 --> 00:00:21,717
I assumed. as in a number of languages.
that the gesture was part of the phrase.

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,348
-Well. it's not.
-Why am I supposed to know that?

9
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:27,875
As teacher. it's your obligation
to separate your personal idiosyncrasies...

10
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,439
...from the subject matter.

11

-l'm glad you decided to learn Mandarin.
-Why?

My apologies. Leonard.
I'm only as good as my teacher.

...as tangerine chicken.
and I intend to confront them.

Not surprising.
Penny's emotional responses...

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,958
...originate in the primitive portion
of brain. the amygdala.

36
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,793
While speech is centered
in the recently developed neocortex.

giving scientific credence...

38
00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:38,518
...to the notion
of being rendered speechless.

39
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:45,875

and try talking to her again.

Good idea.
Sit with her. hold her. comfort her.

48
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,913
And if the moment feels right.
see if you can cop a feel.

for the Leonard character.

Not necessarily. I'm often surprised
by my lack of familiarity with Leonard.

197
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,590
Just the other day. I discovered
he not only has a loofah. he hides it.

Why do you suppose a man
would be ashamed of having a loofah?

that despite his lactose intolerance...

Okay. so here's the thing.

210
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,553
I guess you're aware
that Leonard asked me out.

211
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,392
Well. he didn't actually say anything.

212
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:01,357
But when he came back to the apartment.
he was doing a dance...

213
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,317

the happy hippos in Fantasia.

Oh. that's nice.

215
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,110

the thing I wanted to talk to about is...

216

There are a number of options and....

222
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,632
I'm really not familiar enough

like it. sit somewhere else next time?

Okay.

228

Here's the thing.

229
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:52,711
So I've known for a while now that
Leonard has had a little crush on me--

230
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,552
A little crush?

231
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,074
Well. I suppose so.

232
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,915
In the same way Menelaus
had a little crush on Helen of Troy.

233
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,678
I don't really know who they are--

234
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,398
Menelaus was the brother
of Agamemnon--

235
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,073
Yeah. I don't care. Listen.

236
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,832
The point is...

237
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,639
...Leonard isn't the kind of guy
I usually go out with.

238
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,110
Leonard isn't the kind of guy
anyone usually goes out with.

239
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,753
Would you be open to rotating
the couch clockwise 30 degrees?

240
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,198
No. What I'm saying is. Leonard
might be different in a good way.

241
00:13:22,599 --> 00:13:25,591
And obviously. my usual choices
have not worked out so well.

242
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:29,752
Your last one worked out well
for Koothrappali. He got a free iPod.

243
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,231
Oh. glare.

244
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:34,708
But on the other hand...

245
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,236
...if things don't go well with Leonard.
I risk losing a really good friend.

246
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,071
I mean. he's not looking for a fling.

247
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,028
He's the kind that gets into a relationship
for. like you would say. light-years.

248
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:45,268
I would not say that.

249
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,869
No one would say that.
A light-year is a unit of distance. not time.

and they think duration.

when or if the poison has been released...

273
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,839

can be thought of as both alive and dead.

that you'll find out which it is.

I should go out with Leonard?
