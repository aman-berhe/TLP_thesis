1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,390
So. what you're eating
is not technically yogurt.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,710
It doesn't have enough
live acidophilus cultures.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,997
It's really just ice milk
with carrageenan added for thickness.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,790
-Well. that's very interesting.
-|t's also not pink and has no berries.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,315
Yeah. but it doesn't really
answer my question.

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,994
-What was your question again?
-Do you want some?

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,593
Ah.

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,076
-Right. No. I'm lactose intolerant.
-Right.

9
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:26,275
-So gas.
-Yeah. got it.

10
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,793
Well. good night.

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,757
-What are you doing?
-There was a draft.

12
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,639
PENNY:
ldidn't feel a draft.

13
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,509
-Why don't we just go into your--?
-Oh. yeah.

14
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,510
Maybe we should
slow things down a little.

15
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:58,113
No. I didn't mean
to go into your apartment to go fast.

16
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,838
No. I know.

17
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,032
I know what you meant.
It's just this is only our first date.

18
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,189
Okay. Sure. No problem.

19
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,555
Why don't we just figure out
where we're going...

20
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:08,755
...and when we want to get there?

21
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,629
And then rate of speed
equals distance over time.

22
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,310
Solve for R.

23
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,873
Or we could just wing it.

24
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,756
That might work too.

25
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,351
-Good night. Leonard.
-Good night.

26
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:30,991
He's coming. Screen saver.

27
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,350
Oh. hey. Leonard.

28
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:40,033
-How was your date?
-Bite me.

29
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,475
Sheldon. how could you just sit there
and let them spy on me?

30
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,629
They were clever.

31
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,030
They exploited my complete lack
of interest in what you were doing.

32
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,153
You should thank us. When future
generations try to determine...

33
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,834
...why your relationship with Penny
crashed and burned...

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,833
...this right here is the black box.

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,673
What are you talking about?
The date went fine.

36
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:04,591
She said she wants to slow things down.

37
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:07,398
Okay. so she said
she wants to slow things down.

38
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:11,234
It's like saying.
“I'm really enjoying this meal.

39
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,119
I'm going to slow down and savor it.“

40
00:02:14,279 --> 00:02:17,635
No. it's like. “This fish tastes bad...

41
00:02:18,359 --> 00:02:21,157
...so I'm gonna slow down
and spit it out.“

42
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,990
-You being the fish.
-|'m not the fish.

43
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:26,877
Oh. really?
Did you make a second date?

44
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,955
-Well. no. We sort of decided to wing it.
-Oh. even I know that's lame.

45
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:34,828
Okay. All right.
Let's assume your hypothesis.

46
00:02:34,999 --> 00:02:38,389
We went to dinner. we talked.
we laughed. we kissed.

47
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,879
Where could I have gone wrong?

48
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:43,076
Think back. Leonard.
The littlest things can set women off.

49
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:47,152
Like. "Hey. the waitress is hot. I bet we
could get her to come home with us.“

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,879
Or. “How much does your mom weigh?
I wanna know what I'm getting into.“

51
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:55,315
-I didn't say anything like that.
-Good. because they don't work.

52
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,793
They don't care for it
if you stare at them and hyperventilate.

53
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,235
Sadly. that's my home-run swing.

54
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,790
Look. everything went fine.

55
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,838
I didn't even have to refer
to my impromptu conversation starters.

56
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:10,229
That woman across the hall is into me.

57
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,353
Let's go to the tape.

58
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,275
Look at her reaction
to the good-night kiss.

59
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,638
No change in respiration. pupils
undilated. no flushing of the chest.

60
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,756
Nice close-up. by the way.

61
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:26,071
Interesting. Her jaws are clenched.
No tongue access.

62
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,436
Clearly a bad sign
amongst mating humans.

63
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,552
That's not a bad sign.

64
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,156
Please. You might as well have been
two iguana with no dewlap enlargement.

65
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,434
And the worst sign of all
is you're here and not there.

66
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,956
I'm not there.
because I'm taking things slow.

67
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,430
Which. by the way. compared
to you guys. approaches warp speed.

68
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,478
And take down that camera.

69
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,793
He was a lot more fun
when he had no hope.

70
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,231
Give him time.

71
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:32,389
-Hi.
-Oh. hi. Penny.

72
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,235
Yeah. FYI. the hot water is inadequate
on Machine 2. so colors only.

73
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:39,357
Four is still releasing the fabric softener
too early in the cycle.

74
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:42,716
-So I'd avoid using that for your delicates.
-Thanks.

75
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,469
Well. good Lord.

76
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,869
Why don't you just take
your clothes down to the river...

77
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,267
...and beat them with a rock?

78
00:04:54,799 --> 00:04:57,313
Sheldon. may I ask you a question?

79
00:04:57,799 --> 00:05:01,269
I would prefer that you not.
but I won't go so far as to forbid it.

80
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,992
All right. I heard “yes." so....

81
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,314
Okay. here's my question:

82
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:11,275
Has Leonard ever dated.
you know. a regular girl?

83
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,676
Well. I assume you're not referring
to digestive regularity.

84
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,031
Because I've come to learn
that such inquiries are inappropriate.

85
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,510
No. I meant has he ever been involved
with someone who wasn't a brainiac?

86
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:27,749
Oh! Well. a few years ago...

87
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,832
...he did go out with a woman
who had a Ph.D. in French literature.

88
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:37,115
-How is that not a brainiac?
-Well. for one thing. she was French.

89
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,507
For another. it was literature.

90
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,679
So....

91
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,070
Do you think that if Leonard
and I keep dating...

92
00:05:52,239 --> 00:05:54,594
...he'll eventually get bored with me?

93
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,230
-That depends.
-On what?

94
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,195
Do you have a working knowledge
of quantum physics?

95
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,554
No.

96
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,631
Do you speak Klingon?

97
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,149
No.

98
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:12,908
-You know any card tricks?
-Okay.

99
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,034
| get it. Leonard has no business
being involved with a waitress/actress...

100
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,557
...who felt so insecure. that she lied to
him about finishing community college.

101
00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:25,198
Why would you lie about that?

102
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:27,998
He was going on about this college
and that grad school...

103
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,516
...and I didn't want him to think
l was some kind of stupid loser.

104
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:35,672
You thought the opposite of “stupid loser“
was “community-college graduate“?

105
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:42,793
There are a lot of successful people
in this country...

106
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,711
...who are community-college graduates.

107
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:46,995
Yeah. but you are neither.

108
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,035
Right. Okay. look.
this is between you and me.

109
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,158
You cannot tell Leonard any of this.

110
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,073
-You're asking me to keep a secret?
-Yeah.

111
00:06:58,239 --> 00:06:59,354
Well. I'm sorry.

112
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,636
You would've had to express that desire
before revealing the secret...

113
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:04,949
...so that I could choose whether
I wanted to accept...

114
00:07:05,119 --> 00:07:06,598
...the covenant of secret-keeping.

115
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:10,629
You can't impose a secret
on an ex post facto basis.

116
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,352
What?

117
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:16,670
Secret-keeping is a complicated endeavor.
One has to be concerned...

118
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:20,832
...not only about what one says.
but facial expressions. autonomic reflexes.

119
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,474
When I try to deceive...

120
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,155
...I myself have more nervous tics
than a Lyme disease research facility.

121
00:07:32,239 --> 00:07:33,228
It's a joke.

122
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,029
It relies on the homonymic relationship
between tick. the bloodsucking arachnid...

123
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,555
...and tic. the involuntary
muscular contraction.

124
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,039
[CHUCKLES]

125
00:07:43,999 --> 00:07:45,114
I made it up myself.

126
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:50,034
Okay. look. if Leonard finds out
that I lied...

127
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,634
...I will absolutely die
of embarrassment.

128
00:07:52,799 --> 00:07:55,677
-Physio|ogical|y impossible.
-Oh. Sheldon. please.

129
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:57,750
Look. I'm asking you as a friend.

130
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,309
You're saying that friendship
contains within it...

131
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,914
...an inherent obligation
to maintain confidences?

132
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:07,389
-Well. yeah.
-|nteresting.

133
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,228
One more question.
Perhaps I should've led with this:

134
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:12,390
When did we become friends?

135
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:16,551
|.e.. I couldn't become
Green Lantern...

136
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,472
...unless I was chosen by
the Guardians of Oa.

137
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,517
Given enough startup capital
and an adequate research facility...

138
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,636
...I could be Batman.

139
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,112
-You could be Batman?
-Sure.

140
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,314
[IN DEEP VOICE]
l'm Batman.

141
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,469
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
See?

142
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,788
-Hi. guys.
-Hey.

143
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,473
-Hi. Penny.
-Hey.

144
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,034
If you're not doing anything Friday night.
I thought we could go see a movie.

145
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,760
You know. I think l have the dinner shift
on Friday.

146
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,480
-Okay. What about Saturday?
-You know. I'm not sure.

147
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:49,517
The manager hasn't posted the schedule.
How about I let you know?

148
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,669
-Great.
-Okay.

149
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:52,989
So you just let me know
when you know.

150
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,232
Okay. so-- Oh. God. I am the bad fish.

151
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:00,877
-What did I do wrong?
-Why are you asking me?

152
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:04,471
l have no information
about your interactions with Penny...

153
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:07,437
...nor do l have any method
of learning such things.

154
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:11,550
LEONARD: What does that mean?
-Nothing.

155
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:14,791
You seem to be implying a back channel
between me and Penny...

156
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,519
-...where. obviously. none exists.
-No. I didn't.

157
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,831
| just think you need to be careful
how you phrase things. sir.

158
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,477
-What's going on with you?
-Well. I might ask you the same question.

159
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,314
Why do you drag me into matters
which have nothing to do with me...

160
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,189
...but exist between you and Penny.
a person to whom I barely speak?

161
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,830
What's wrong with your face?

162
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,033
There's no reason
to bring my looks into this.

163
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,630
-Good day. Leonard.
-What?

164
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,030
I said. good day.

165
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,517
Good day?

166
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,350
Also today we have
a fresh-caught Alaska salmon...

167
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,669
...served with a teriyaki glaze
