1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,554
Worst Renaissance fair ever.

2
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:09,396
Please let it go. Sheldon.

3
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:12,471
SHELDON:
It was rife with historical inaccuracies.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,029
For example. the tavern girl
serving flagcns cf mead.

5
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:17,394
Now. her costume
was obviously Germanic...

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,599
...but in 1487, the Bavarian purity laws.
or Reinheitsgebut...

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,069
...severely limited the availability
of mead.

8
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:26,150
At best.
they would've had some spiced wine.

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,788
LEONARD: You're nitpicking.
SHELDON: Oh. really?

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,439
Well. here's another nit for you.

11
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:33,591
The flagons would not have been made
of polypropylene.

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,672
Renaissance fairs
aren't about historical accuracy.

13
00:00:36,839 --> 00:00:39,307
They're about taking chubby girls
who work at Kinko's...

14
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:41,390
...and lacing them up
in corsets so tight...

15
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,393
...their bosom jumps out
and says. “Howdy.“

16
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,674
Bosoms would not have said. "Howdy."
in the 15th century.

17
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:49,989
If anything.
they would've said. “Huzzah.“

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,071
I don't care what the bosoms say.
Sheldon.

19
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,878
| just wanna be part of the conversation.

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,715
Hi. guys.

21
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,915
Looks like you've been
to the Renaissance fair.

22
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,957
I'm hoping.

23
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,109
Renaissance fair?

24
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,430
More of a medieval-slash-
Age of Enlightenment...

25
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:07,671
...slash-
any-excuse-to-wear-a-codpiece fair.

26
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:10,718
Okay. fine. whatever.
Um. you guys. this is my friend Eric.

27
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:12,915
-Hel|o.
ERIC: Hey.

28
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,110
So. yeah. good to see you.

29
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,716
Yeah. Yeah. it's good to see you too.

30
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:23,637
-We should probably go.
-Yeah.

31
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:26,916
-Bye. guys.
-Like your hat.

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,309
Thanks. my mom made it.

33
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:35,436
Penny with a new guy. Tre‘s awkward.

34
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:38,474
It wasn't awkward.

35
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,317
It wasn't fun.
Besides. what's the big deal?

36
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,755
We dated. we stopped dating.
and now we're both moving on.

37
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,480
By “moving on." you mean
she's going out with other men...

38
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,599
...and you spend the afternoon
making 15th-century soap with Wolowitz?

39
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,631
That was not 15th-century soap.

40
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,712
My god. those people need to learn
you can't just put “ye olde“...

41
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,713
...in front of anything you want
and expect to get away with it.

42
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,316
Can we please just go in?
My chain mail's stuck in my underwear.

43
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,590
You're wearing modern underwear?

44
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,230
Relatively modern.

45
00:02:11,359 --> 00:02:12,394
What are you wearing?

46
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:16,347
l fashioned historically accurate
undergarments out of linen.

47
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,794
You went and bought linen?

48
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,032
Don't be silly.
I borrowed one of your pillowcases.

49
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:25,350
Borrowed?

50
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,751
You know.
I'm happy that Penny's moving on.

51
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:52,671
It gives me freedom to move on myself.

52
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,877
Are you saying
that you've been holding back?

53
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:59,108
Of course. Out of respect.

54
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,239
So how do you explain
the 10 years before Penny?

55
00:03:03,999 --> 00:03:06,149
Who were you respecting then?

56
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,794
What? I've dated plenty of women.

57
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,999
There was. uh. Joyce Kim.
Leslie Winkle....

58
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,795
Notify the editors
of the Oxford English Dictionary:

59
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,872
The word “plenty“
has been redefined to mean “two.“

60
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,951
What about that girl last year
at Comic-Con?

61
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,712
-It doesn't count.
-Why not?

62
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:29,474
What happens in costume at Comic-Con
stays at Comic-Con.

63
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:31,949
You're only saying that
because of what happened.

64
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,475
-What happened to you?
-Nothing happened to me.

65
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,034
It wasn't your fault. Raj.

66
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,317
He was dressed
as a green Orion slave girl.

67
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,229
How did we get on me?
We were mocking Leonard.

68
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,551
-Dude. you have totally not moved on.
-Yes. l have.

69
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:49,836
It's just a matter
of actually making a date with someone.

70
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:53,548
-Like who?
-Well. there's Joyce Kim.

71
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:56,995
But she defected back to North Korea...

72
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,954
...so it's a little
geographically undesirable.

73
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,476
-What about Leslie Winkle?
-Oh. no.

74
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,949
-Why?
-Her research methodology is sloppy...

75
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,839
...she's unjustifiably arrogant
about loop quantum gravity...

76
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:12,071
...and to make matters worse.
she's often mean to me.

77
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,076
-I think she's smoking hot.
-|'d hit that.

78
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,748
You'd hit particulate soil
in a colloidal suspension.

79
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,989
Mud.

80
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:26,039
Look. I like Leslie.
but she's not interested in dating...

81
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,667
...as much as using men as tools
for stress release.

82
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,229
Yeah? So? Be a tool.

83
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,396
Go get yourself
a little rebound stress release.

84
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:39,235
It would only be rebound if he and Penny
had actually engaged in physical intimacy.

85
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:42,436
You mean like you
and Richard the slave girl?

86
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,076
I bought him dinner and we kissed once.
That was it.

87
00:04:47,599 --> 00:04:50,067
And he told me his name was Kimberly.

88
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,671
You know how I know
we're not in the Matrix?

89
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,268
How?

90
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:05,876
If we were. the food would be better.

91
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,035
Hey. Leonard.

92
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:10,838
-Hey. Leslie.
-Hey. dummy.

93
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,078
Hello to you.
insufficiently intelligent person.

94
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:18,192
Ooh. rush me to the Burn Unit.

95
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,915
Do you have a second?
I need to ask you something.

96
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,355
-Yeah. sure.
-Well. if you'll excuse me...

97
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,830
...l'm going to go do work
that promises significant results...

98
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,959
...as opposed to what you do.
which does not.

99
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,751
Yeah. you heard me.

100
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,388
Wow.

101
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,198
So I heard your relationship with Penny
crashed to the ground...

102
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,079
...like blue ice
falling out of an airplane lavatory.

103
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:00,271
-Where'd you hear that?
-Actually. I read it. Wolowitz texted me.

104
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,355
“Like blue ice
falling out of an airplane lavatory.“ yep.

105
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,956
Yeah. I thought it was a pretty good one.
I gave him an “LOL.“

106
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,519
Anyway. it got me thinking.

107
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:13,467
Now that you're unattached. maybe
we can revisit our previous attachment.

108
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:16,915
Are you suggesting another bout
of stress release?

109
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,559
No. I'm all done with casual sex.

110
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,473
l'm fully committed
to the traditional relationship paradigm.

111
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:22,594
Really? What changed?

112
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,991
There's just a time
in every woman's life...

113
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:27,354
...when she gets tired of waking up
on a futon...

114
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:29,669
...with a bunch of people
she doesn't know.

115
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,796
Yeah. I can see how that would--
A bunch of people?

116
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:36,348
Anyway. I just figure
it's time to slow things down...

117
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:39,431
...and who better to slow things down with
than you?

118
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,952
l'm flattered.

119
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:45,788
So how do you suggest we proceed?

120
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:49,315
Your place. We'll order Chinese.
You'll rent a movie. artsy but accessible.

121
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,391
Then light petting. no coitus.

122
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,757
-Sounds fun.
-|'|| leave the details up to you.

123
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,911
I think it's better
if you assume the male role.

124
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:02,430
Thank you. that's very thoughtful.

125
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,518
Great.

126
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:06,271
Call me.

127
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,270
Hey. great news.
My mom sent me my old Nintendo 64.

128
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,589
LEONARD:
Oh.

129
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,156
-Terrific.
-You know what this means. don't you?

130
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,359
Break out the Red Bull.
It's time to rock “Mario“ old school.

131
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:28,034
-I kind of have other plans tonight.
-But it's Friday.

132
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,749
Friday's always vintage-game night.
Look. Mom included the memory card.

133
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,197
We can pick up right where I left off
in 1999 when I had pernicious anemia.

134
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:38,271
The thing is. someone's coming over.

135
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,591
Well. no problem. l have three controllers.
The more the merrier.

136
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:44,268
Sheldon. it's a date.
l have a date coming over.

137
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,589
Oh.

138
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,157
Well. you can't blame me
for not jumping to that conclusion.

139
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:53,473
Why? What's so unusual
about me having a date?

140
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,153
-Well. statistically speaking--
-All right. all right.

141
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,719
Nevertheless. I have one now...

142
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,156
...and I'd appreciate it if you would.
you know. make yourself scarce.

143
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,993
I am a published theoretical physicist
with two doctorates...

144
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:06,468
...and an IO which can't be measured
by normal tests.

145
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,834
How much scarcer could I be?

146
00:08:09,799 --> 00:08:13,030
You know what I mean.
Could you just give us a little privacy?

147
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,430
-You want me to leave the apartment?
-Yes.

148
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,909
You mean just go someplace else
and be...

149
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,558
...someplace else?

150
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,432
-Yes.
-But why should I leave?

151
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,556
-This is my apartment too.
-I know it is.

152
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,393
lf science ever discovers a second member
of your species...

153
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,269
...and you two would like some privacy.
I'd be happy to get out of your way.

154
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,276
Well. all right. then.

155
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,439
Sheldon? What are you doing?

156
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:45,832
Playing “Super Mario“
on a poorly coded Nintendo 64 emulator.

157
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,032
But why are you doing it on the stairs?

158
00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:51,714
I am a modern-day Napoleon
exiled to the Elba of the staircase...

159
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,838
...because Leonard. get this. has a date.

160
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,675
Oh. Oh. well. good for him.

161
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:02,388
Yeah. but why are you sitting here?
Why don't you go to a movie or something?

162
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,198
Alone?

163
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,669
-Yeah. why not?
-What if I choke on my popcorn?

164
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,070
Who will administer
the Heimlich maneuver?

165
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:12,034
-Then don't order popcorn.
-No popcorn at the mov--?

166
00:09:12,199 --> 00:09:13,234
Listen to yourself.

167
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:17,399

...or ever get a good view of a parade.
