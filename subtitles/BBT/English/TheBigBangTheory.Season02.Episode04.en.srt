00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:03,629
Let's see.
Raj was the [mug pan chicken.

2
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:06,552
-|'m the dumplings.
-Yes. you are.

3
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:09,271
Creepy. Howard.

4
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:10,872
Creepy good or creepy bad?

5
00:00:12,239 --> 00:00:14,833
-Who was the shrimp with lobster sauce?
-That would be me.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,390
Come to papa. you un-kosher delight.

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,429
I'm not necessarily talking to the food.

8
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:28,311
Sit over there.

9
00:00:32,879 --> 00:00:34,551
Sit over there.

10
00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:45,749
-Baby wipe?
-Why do you have--?

11
00:00:45,919 --> 00:00:47,671
-No. don't ask.
-No. don't. don't.

12
00:00:48,839 --> 00:00:49,828
I'll tell you why.

13
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,589
I had to sanitize my hands
because the university...

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,797
...replaced the paper towels
in the restrooms with hot-air blowers.

15
00:00:56,959 --> 00:00:58,870
I thought the blowers
were more sanitary.

16
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,393
-Why?
-Really. don't.

17
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,958
Hot-air blowers are incubators
and spewers of bacteria and pestilence.

18
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,792
It'd be more hygienic
if they had a plague-infested gibbon...

19
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,076
...sneeze my hands dry.

20
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,391
Hey. guys.
I just got the most amazing new--

21
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,275
Do you think you'll ever be able to talk
in front of me without being drunk?

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,878
Okay. well. I'll just go eat by myself.

23
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:26,870
-You don't have to do that.
-|t's okay.

24
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:30,076
Between him not talking.
him talking. and him...

25
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:33,957
...l'm better off alone.

26
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,429
So goodbye. you poor.
strange little man.

27
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,713
-She's so considerate.
-So. what's your news?

28
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:46,552
Remember that little object
I spotted beyond the Kuiper belt?

29
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:48,710
Oh. yeah. 2008-NO sub-17.

30
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,678
Or as I call it. Planet Bollywood.

31
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,633
Anyway. because of my discovery...

32
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:57,109
...Peuple Magazine is naming me
one of their 30 Under 30 to Watch.

33
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,113
-Raj. that's incredible.
-Congratulations.

34
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,400
Excuse me. 30 what under 30 what
to watch what?

35
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,114
Thirty visionaries
under 30 years of age to watch...

36
00:02:08,279 --> 00:02:11,351
...as they challenge
the preconceptions of the fields.

37
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,398
If I had a million guesses.
I never would have gotten that.

38
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:18,670
They've got me in with a guy doing
something about hunger in Indonesia...

39
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,752
...a psychotherapist using dolphins
to rehabilitate prisoners...

40
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:26,390
...and Ellen Page. star of the charming
independent film .Iunu.

41
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,473
Oh. l'd so do her.

42
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,188
You'd do the dolphins.

43
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,875
Do | get a mention...

44
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,759
...for designing the telescope camera
mounting bracket?

45
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:40,877
Sorry. it's not part of my heartwarming
and personal narrative...

46
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,110
...in which a humble boy
from New Delhi...

47
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:44,792
...overcame poverty and prejudice...

48
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,520
...and journeyed to America
to reach for the stars.

49
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,116
Poverty? Your father's a gynecologist.
He drives a Bentley.

50
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,358
It's a lease.

51
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,154
I'm confused. Was there
some sort of peer-review committee...

52
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,550
...to determine which scientists
would be included?

53
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,315
Peer review? lt's People Magazine.
People picked me.

54
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,438
-What people?
-The people from People.

55
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,909
What? Yeah. but exactly
who are these people?

56
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,640
What are their credentials?
How are they qualified?

57
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,109
What makes accidentally noticing
a hunk of rock...

58
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:20,032
...traipsing around the solar system
for billions of years...

59
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,158
...more noteworthy than any other
scientific accomplishment...

60
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,753
...by someone under 30?

61
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,476
Boy. I'll bet Ellen Page's friends
aren't giving her this kind of crap.

62
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:34,788
You proud of yourself?

63
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,990
In general. yes.

64
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,679
Oh. there's my missing neutrino.

65
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,229
You were hiding from me
as an unbalanced charge...

66
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,119
...weren't you.
you little subatomic dickens?

67
00:04:13,999 --> 00:04:16,718
-Hi. Sheldon.
-Hey. look. I found my missing neutrino.

68
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:19,347
Oh. good.
we can take it off the milk carton.

69
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:23,269
We're gonna apologize
and invite Raj out to dinner.

70
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,192
Apologize? For what?

71
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,430
He came over last night
with some pretty good news...

72
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:29,396
...and we weren't very supportive.

73
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:32,794
I sense you're trying
to tell me something.

74
00:04:33,359 --> 00:04:36,351
You were a colossal asshat.

75
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:39,951
Oh. no. I beg to differ.

76
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,475
Of the three of us.
l was by far the most supportive.

77
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,231
Really? Do tell.

78
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,915
How will Raj ever reach true greatness
if his friends lower the bar for him?

79
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:49,672
When I was 11...

80
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:52,478
...my sister bought our father
a “world's greatest dad“ coffee mug.

81
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,551
And frankly. the man coasted
until the day he died.

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,399
Okay. let's try it this way.

83
00:04:58,559 --> 00:05:01,710
What if this People Magazine thing
is the best Raj is going to achieve?

84
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,237
-I had not considered that.
-Mm-hm. Come on.

85
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:09,238
I often forget
other people have limitations.

86
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,356
It's so sad.

87
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,308
-He can feel sadness?
-Not really.

88
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,436
It's what you and I call condescension.

89
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,118
Now. when we go in there.
let's show Raj that we're happy for him.

90
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,952
But I'm not.

91
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:26,275
Well. then fake it.
Look at me.

92
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,910
I could be grinding on the fact that
without my stabilizing telescope mount...

93
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,993
...he never would have found that
stupid little clump of cosmic schmutz.

94
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,511
But I'm bigger than that.

95
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,592
Fine. What do you want me to do?

-Hey. Raj.
-Hey. guys. What's up?

102
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,196

Who in this room discovered a star?

00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,033
Actually. 2008-NO sub-17
is a planetary body.

111
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,270
I'm not talking about you.
I'm talking about me.

You. my exotic young friend.
are my star.

113
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,832
But you didn't discover him.
You merely noticed he was here...

114
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,560
...much like he did
with 2008-NO sub-17.

-She|don.
-Ugh. Sorry.

-|'d rather have Fishbein's. lt's bigger.
GABLEHAUSER: Done.

00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,511
Wait. I called dibs
on Fishbein's office...

121
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,956
...the day he started showing up at work
in his bathrobe.
