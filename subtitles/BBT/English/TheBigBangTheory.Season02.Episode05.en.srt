There are three answers.
none of which are correct.

219
00:12:29,599 --> 00:12:30,634
The correct answer is:

220
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:33,472
“When covered by liquid
sufficient to reduce the coefficient...

221
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:36,312
...to static friction between the tire
and the road to zero.

222
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,552

a new source of friction.“
