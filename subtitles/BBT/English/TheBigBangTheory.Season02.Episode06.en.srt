1
00:00:01,279 --> 00:00:03,998
So if you are considering
going into experimental physics...

2
00:00:04,159 --> 00:00:05,877
...my door is always open.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,759
Again. I'm sorry that the demonstration
didn't quite work out.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,148
Now we know what happens...

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,472
...when you accidentally spill peach
Snapple into a helium-neon laser.

6
00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:18,188
The short answer is don't.

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,994
Now to tell you about
the Theoretical Physics Department...

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,593
...is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

9
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:33,068
-Dr. Cooper?
SHELDON: Forget it.

10
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:36,357
Excuse me.

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,714
-Sheldon. we both agreed to do this.
SHELDON: It's a waste of time.

12
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:43,110
I might as well explain thermodynamics
to a bunch of Labradoodles.

13
00:00:45,319 --> 00:00:49,358
If you don't do this. I won't take
you to the comic-book store.

14
00:00:51,639 --> 00:00:53,152
Hello.

15
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,432
Nice work with the laser. by the way.

16
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,590
Looking out at your fresh young faces...

17
00:01:04,759 --> 00:01:07,910
...I remember when I too
was deciding my academic future...

18
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:10,752
...as a lowly graduate student.

19
00:01:10,919 --> 00:01:13,114
Of course. I was 14...

20
00:01:13,559 --> 00:01:15,948
...and had achieved more
than you could ever hope to...

21
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,270
...despite my 9:00 bedtime.

22
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,398
Now. there may be one or two of you
in this room who has what it takes...

23
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,596
...to succeed in theoretical physics.

24
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,069
It's more likely that you will spend
your careers teaching fifth graders...

25
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:32,549
...how to make papier-maché volcanoes
with baking-soda lava.

26
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,474
Oh. good God.

27
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,632
In short. anyone who told you
that you would someday be able...

28
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,030
...to make any significant contribution
to physics played a trick on you.

29
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,872
A cruel trick indeed.

30
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,628
Any questions?

31
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,631
Of course not.

32
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,437
l weep for the future of science.

33
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:58,477
Now. if you'll excuse me.
the latest issue of Batman is out.

34
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:00,912
Come. Leonard.

35
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,998
Laser demonstration's looking
pretty good now. huh?

36
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,514
I love this time of the year.

37
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,513
The leaves are turning.
There's a bracing chill in the air.

38
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,194
Plus. there's a whole new crop
of female grad students...

39
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,351
...about to put on just enough
winter weight...

40
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:42,111
...to make them needy and vulnerable.

41
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:47,829
That's right. honey. have another
calzone. Daddy can wait.

42
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,998
Isn't there a policy
against dating graduate students?

43
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,390
No. If you can talk to them.
you can ask them out.

44
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:56,992
Damn. There's always a catch.

45
00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:00,156
-Hey. guys.
-Hey. Leslie.

46
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,471
So. dumb-ass. I heard you made
a grad student throw up last night.

47
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,871
The truth can indeed be a finger down
the throat of those unprepared to hear it.

48
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,676
But why should I cater
to second-rate minds?

49
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,237
Because first-rate minds
call you “dumb-ass.“

50
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,792
Oh. yeah? Well--

51
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,837
You're a mean person.

52
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,228
Excuse me. Dr. Cooper?

53
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:25,948
l'm Ramona Nowitzki.
l was at your talk last night.

54
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,279
-I think you're just brilliant.
-Well. that is the prevailing opinion.

55
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,955
God. now I'm gonna throw up.

56
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,875
Howard Wolowitz.
Department of Engineering...

57
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,431
...co-designer of the International Space
Station's liquid-waste-disposal system.

58
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,353
Ew.

59
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,390
Dr. Cooper. I've read everything
you've published.

60
00:03:49,559 --> 00:03:52,869
I liked your paper on grand unification
using string-network condensates...

61
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,758
...and was wondering how you
determined that three-dimensional...

62
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:58,275
...string nets provided a unified picture
of fermions and gauge bosons.

63
00:03:58,679 --> 00:04:02,228
Amazing. An intelligent Labradoodle.

64
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,394
Woof.

65
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,430
The fact is.
I'm quite close to a breakthrough...

66
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,398
...in showing how neutrinos emerge
from a string-net condensate.

67
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:14,915
Oh. my God. That would change the way
we view the entire physical universe.

68
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:16,831
It's what I do.

69
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:20,471
You know. the Pishkin-Wolowitz
liquid-waste-disposal system...

70
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,153
...is turning a few heads as well.

71
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,908
Again. ew.

72
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,756
You know. I'd love to hear more
about how you intend to add neutrinos.

73
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,310
-Could we get a cup of coffee sometime?
-I don't drink coffee.

74
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,357
I do. I love me a cup of Joe.

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,991
It doesn't have to be coffee.
How about dinner?

76
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,149
I do eat dinner.

77
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,151
Great. I know a terrific little ltalian place.

78
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:46,718
I never eat in strange restaurants.

79
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:49,234
One runs the risk
of non-standard cutlery.

80
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,188
Excuse me?

81
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:55,034
Sheldon lives in fear
of the three-tined fork.

82
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,237
Three tines is not a fork.
Three tines is a trident.

83
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,393
Forks are for eating.
tridents are for ruling the seven seas.

84
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:06,989
-What if I brought food to your place?
-That would be acceptable.

85
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,513
On Mondays. | eat Thai food.

86
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,195
Mee Krob and chicken satay with
extra peanut sauce from Siam Palace.

87
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:15,237
You got it. I already have your address.

88
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:20,431
What a nice girl.

89
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,719
Sheldon. do you have any idea
what just happened?

90
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,157
Yes. Apparently.
I'm getting a free dinner.

91
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,876
Oh, yeah. no.
this thing's majorly out of order.

92
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,315
-See? I'm sorry.
-Okay. Guess I'm taking the stairs.

93
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:39,958
-Where you going?
-Four-A.

94
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,271
-Oh. are you here to see Leonard?
-No. Dr. Cooper.

95
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,034
Dr. Sheldon Cooper?

96
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,432
We're having dinner.

97
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:50,908
Sheldon Cooper?

98
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:56,397
Tall. thin. looks a little like
a giant praying mantis?

99
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,196
He is cute. isn't he?

100
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,714
PENNY:
Sheldon Cooper?

101
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,472
-Hi. Leonard.
-Hey. Ramona. Come on in.

102
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:11,072
Thanks. Where should I put this?

103
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,798
-The kitchen's fine.
-Okay.

104
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,072
-Hey. What are you doing?
-I need to see this.

105
00:06:15,239 --> 00:06:16,513
Uh-huh.

106
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,194
The viewing area's right over there.

107
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:25,557
Sheldon. your girl-- Date-- Person--
Ramona's here.

108
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,994
-Oh. hello.
-Oh. sorry I'm late.

109
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,628
I got caught up reading the draft
of your latest paper.

110
00:06:31,799 --> 00:06:35,428
Did you enjoy the footnote where l
illustrate mirror symmetry by likening it...

111
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,033
...to The Flash playing tennis
with himself?

112
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,189
So funny.

113
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:39,553
[LAUGHS]

114
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,280
The idea that you might be able
to incorporate gravity...

115
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,228
...l have to tell you.
I found it physically exhilarating.

116
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,109
My hypotheses tend to have that effect.

117
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:54,269
I'm sorry I didn't bring enough
for your friends.

118
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,749
I assumed we were going to be alone.

119
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,837
Oh. Yeah. No. we were just going.

120
00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:03,398
To watch. right?

121
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,392
-No. Come on now. We're going out.
-Oh. come on. We'll be quiet.

122
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,875
Come on. let's go.

123
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,589
Okay. you two.

124
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:18,398
You just have a nice whatever this is.

125
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:23,868
Okay. you guys. look.
I know this is none of my business...

126
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,792
...but I just-- I have to ask.

127
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,631
What's Sheldon's deal?

128
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,032
-What do you mean. "deal“?
-You know. like. what's his deal?

129
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,237
Is it girls? Guys? Sock puppets?

130
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:42,236
Honestly. we've been operating under
the assumption that he has no deal.

131
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:44,959
-Oh. come on. everybody has a deal.
-Not Sheldon.

132
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,477
Over the years. we've formulated many
theories about how he might reproduce.

133
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,353
I'm an advocate of mitosis.

134
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,554
l'm
s
o
rry?

135
00:07:55,719 --> 00:07:58,870
I believe. one day. Sheldon will eat
an enormous amount of Thai food...

136
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,952
...and split into two Sheldons.

137
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:06,595
On the other hand. I think Sheldon
might be the larval form of his species.

138
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,955
He'll spin a cocoon
and emerge two months later...

139
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,475
...with moth wings and an exoskeleton.

140
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:15,471
Okay. well. thanks for the nightmares.

141
00:08:16,679 --> 00:08:20,592
-Hey. do you wanna hang out with us?
-Well. what are you guys gonna do?

142
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:22,908
Uh....

143
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,640
My mom's making a brisket tonight.

144
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,433
-The one with the little onions?
-Yeah.

145
00:08:32,199 --> 00:08:36,431
Yeah. I'm busy. So good night.

146
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,714
Her loss. Let's go.

147
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,312
Brisket party. B to the R to the l-S-K.

148
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,591
To the E to the T to the....

149
00:08:47,719 --> 00:08:49,914
-Ooh--
-Don't.

150
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,597
-Hey. Aren't you having breakfast?
-Yes.

151
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,030
Are you experimenting
with nutritional suppositories again?

152
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,432
Not in these pants.

153
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:10,552
-So how'd it go with Ramona last night?
-Oh. great.

154
00:09:10,719 --> 00:09:12,630
She's smart. insightful.

155
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,634
She has a very unique way of.
you know. revering me.

156
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,156
-Here's your spinach-mushroom omelet.
-Thank you.

157
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:26,592
-Did anyone touch it?
-Gloves were worn by everyone involved.

158
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:27,908
l was vigilant.

159
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,519
Ramona pointed out that I've been
wasting 20 minutes a day...

160
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,113
...standing on cafeteria lines.

161
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,998
Time which would be
better spent tackling...

162
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,878
...the great physics problems of our day.

163
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,352
You don't tackle the big issues. Ramona.
You fence with them. En garde. Riposte.

164
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,714
[LAUGHING]

165
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,598
Touché.

166
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,272
-Morning.
-Oh. hey. Leslie.

167
00:09:50,439 --> 00:09:52,316
So I see you're organizing your papers...

168
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,677
...for the Smithsonian Museum
of Dumb-Assery.

169
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,113
