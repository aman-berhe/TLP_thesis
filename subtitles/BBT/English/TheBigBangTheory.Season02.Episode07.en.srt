170
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,478
Oh. I didn't tell you?

171
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:03,278
You're banished
from the Cheesecake Factory.

172
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,718
-Why?
-Well. you have three strikes.

173
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:09,351
One. coming in. Two. sitting down.

174
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,909
And three. I don't like your attitude.

175
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,516
You can't do that. Not only is it
a violation of California State Law...

176
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,558
...it flies directly in the face
of Cheesecake Factory policy.

177
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:22,314
Yeah. no. there's a new policy:
No shoes. no shirt. no Sheldon.

178
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,639
I bet we could sell that sign
all over Pasadena.

179
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,550
-Penny. can I talk to you for a minute?
-Uh-huh.

180
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,712
-Hi.
-Hi.

181
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,995
Look. here's the thing.

182
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,516
I talked to Sheldon and he feels terrible.

183
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,195
And he agrees that he was unreasonable
and out of line.

184
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,669
-Really? Well. that's great.
-Yeah.

185
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,670
Oh. just apologize to him. okay?

186
00:09:48,439 --> 00:09:50,794
What? I'm not gonna apologize
to that nutcase.

187
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,474
Come on. it's easy.
He'll even tell you what to say.

188
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,713
Don't you get it? You keep going along
with his insanity. you're encouraging him.

189
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,351
We're not encouraging.
It's more like knuckling under.

190
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:07,349
I like hanging out but I'm not gonna
apologize for something I didn't do.

191
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,556
Well. actually. technically you did do it.

192
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,315
That's strike one. Leonard.

193
00:10:15,439 --> 00:10:17,350
Here you go. Ouesadilla.

194
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,634

195
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:20,073
Here's your pizza.

196
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,357
And thanks to Sheldon's heated
discussion with my manager...

197
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,512
...barbecue bacon cheeseburger. barbecue
sauce. bacon and cheese on the side.

198
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:29,711
Thank you.

199
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,349
Go ahead. Eat it.

200
00:10:36,439 --> 00:10:38,191
I dare you.

201
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:48,719
That's it. There's the house.
I found America's top models!

202
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,393
-Are you sure?
-Look. On the roof.

203

Anai's and Giselle are sunbathing.

You can recognize people
on Google Earth?

206
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,596
Of course not. I got a buddy of mine
at NORAD to have a spy drone fly over.

207
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,555
NORAD? You're using military aircraft?

208
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,269
It was already targeted to poke
around a nuclear reactor in Siberia.

209
00:11:10,439 --> 00:11:12,669
I took it an hour out of its way. tops.

210
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,555
Okay. where is he?

211
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,029
Sheldon? I dropped him off
at the comic book store.

212
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:20,670
Here. Try and go online.

213

heart various things.

I'm gonna introduce your friend
to a world of hurt.

225
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,155
Oh. Penny. you don't
wanna get into it with Sheldon.

226

The guy's one lab accident away
from being a super villain.

ldon't care. l was in junior rodeo. I can
hogtie and castrate him in 60 seconds.

228

No need to neuter the nerd.
I can get you back online.

There. see?

230

SHELDON:
Hello, puny insects.

233
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,752
As a consequence of your efforts
to circumvent my will...

234
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:33,548
...everyone is awarded
one additional strike.

235
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,429
Thanks a lot. Howard.

236
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,674

the one who has to take the class again.

Time to do your laundry. huh?

240
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,195
Saturday night.

241
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,237
Saturday is laundry night.

Every Saturday at 8:15.

244
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:05,393
Easy to anticipate.

245
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,833
SHELDON:
What are you implying?

246
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:11,718
l'm implying
that you're a creature of habit.

247
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:13,392
And if something
were to prevent you...

248
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,949
...from doing your laundry
on Saturday at 8:15...

249
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,270
...you might find it...

250
00:13:18,439 --> 00:13:20,395

255
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,158
No problem.

256
00:13:45,319 --> 00:13:48,834
I'll just do my laundry another night.

257
00:13:48,999 --> 00:13:50,432
Another night?

258
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,352
Well. I guess you can try...

259
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:54,396
...but deep inside
your heart you'll know...

260
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,075
...that laundry night
is always Saturday night.

261

-Your clothes?
-Yes. I left them in the washers.

268
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,957
I went to get them.
they were gone.

269
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:33,797
Really? Despite the sign that says:
“Do not leave laundry unattended“?

270
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,632
Sheldon. where are my clothes?

271
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:39,712
You know. I do recall
seeing some female undergarments.

272
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,189
Where was that? Oh. yes.

273
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,873
Earlier this evening...

274
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,909
...I happened to gaze out the window
and a brassiere caught my eye.

275

...you get a very long stick
and play panty piﬁata.

283
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,832
