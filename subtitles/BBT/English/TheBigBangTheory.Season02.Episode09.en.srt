So do you find the weather satisfying?

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,349
Are you currently sharing in the triumph
of some local sports team?

7
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,712
PENNY: What's wrong with you?
You're freaking me out.

8
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:26,757
I'm striking up a casual conversation
with you.

9
00:00:26,919 --> 00:00:28,671
What's up?

10
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,911
Please don't do that.

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,755
But I'm given to understand when you
have something awkward to discuss...

12
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,559
...it's more palatable
to preface it with banal chitchat.

13
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:45,799
So this wasn't the awkward part?

14
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:49,237
No.

15
00:00:50,959 --> 00:00:53,075
Oh. All right.

17
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,755
SHELDON:
Oh. good. I used that right.

18
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,153
Anyway. you're aware that Leonard has
entered into a new romantic relationship...

19
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:05,992
...which includes a sexual component.

20
00:01:08,199 --> 00:01:11,396
-Okay. feeling the awkward now.
-Wait.

21
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:13,552
Her name is Dr. Stephanie Barnett.

22
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:16,916
And she's a highly distinguished
surgical resident at Fremont Memorial.

23
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:18,194
-Yeah. Leonard told me.
-Good.

24
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,990
What he may have left out is
how important this relationship is to me.

25
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:25,468
-To you?
-Yes.

26
00:01:25,639 --> 00:01:28,437
See. of the handful of women
Leonard's been involved with...

27
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:31,477
...she's the only one
l have ever found tolerable.

28
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,552
Well. what about me?

29
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,470
The statement stands for itself.

30
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,914
Well. aren't you sweet?

31
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,309
Anyway. should you have
any interaction with her...

32
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,677
...it would be most helpful
that she not see you as a sexual rival.

33
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,110
PENNY:
Yeah. I think she's pretty safe.

34
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,113
You say that now.
but consider the following scenario.

35
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,113
You're sitting in your apartment.
lt's late. You're alone.

36
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,670
Your hypothalamus is swimming in
a soup of estrogen and progesterone...

37
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,914
...and. suddenly. even Leonard
seems like a viable sexual candidate.

38
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,832
Or a hookup.
as it's referred to by today's urban youth.

-ReaHy?
-Yes.

40
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,030
Now. should that happen. I would ask you
to find some way to suppress your libido.

41
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,394
I could think about you.

42
00:02:28,559 --> 00:02:30,595
Fine. Whatever works.

43
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:34,354
Always nice talking to you. Sheldon.

44
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,192

45
00:03:02,279 --> 00:03:03,473

Mm.

46
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,668
Well. this is very pleasant.

47
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:14,396
I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.

48
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:18,234
And you said there would never
be enough pasta for the three of us.

49
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,992
I stand corrected.

50
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,673
You know.
ltalian housewives have a rule of thumb:

51
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,308
A handful of dry pasta
about an inch in diameter...

52
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,031
...is sufficient for each person.
as it doubles in volume when cooked.

53
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:31,634
That's very interesting.

54
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:35,109
-Thank you.
-She doesn't mean it. She's being nice.

55
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,516
Well. Stephanie. since Leonard seems
to be dropping the conversational ball...

56
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,035
...I guess I'll just have to pick it up.
Ahem.

57
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,759
Have you ever witnessed a violent crime?

58
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,752
-No.
-Good.

59
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:59,274
-What's your favorite fruit?
-lt. uh--

60

your medical internship?

I got to ride there in a helicopter.

-What? What happened?
-Radiation burns.

69
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,958
A little mishap
while I was building my own CAT scanner.

70
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,199
I'm sorry. you tried to build
your own CAT scanner?

71

of my sister's guinea pig. Snowball...

It led to an interesting expression
in our house:

75

in a CAT scanner.

have gone differently...

a robot sent from the future?

81
