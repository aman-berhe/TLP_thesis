-I don't see anything at all. Sheldon.
-Ugh.

You're the doctor. but I'm constantly
hearing this annoying sound.

Me too.

00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,353
Is it a high-frequency whistle?

No. it's more of a relentless.
narcissistic drone.

00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:23,674
Yeah, there's no inflammation at all.
Sheldon.

00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:25,955
Then it must be a tumor.

00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:28,797
I seriously doubt it.

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,317
Maybe it's a lingering bacterial infection
from all those childhood toilet swirlies.

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,957
Is that possible?
I used to get those all the time.

11
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,270
Even in church.

12
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:45,150
Well. you know. if it is from a swirly.
there's something I can do. okay. Ahem.

-Okay.

correct procedure for a cootie shot.

Leonard moves the meeting not occur.
Second? None heard. the motion fails.

I'd like to begin the meeting
by congratulating you on the progress...

it's more of a wool-fire ant blend.

for you. huh? Sounds serious.

143
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,115
It is. actually.
In fact. I gave it a lot of thought...

144

for us to live together.

153
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:57,709
So go hit on her.

154
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,397
She's not my type.

155
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,112

She was checking you out before.

156
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,840
-She was?
-Of course not. Look at her.

what you guys think.

living together.

159
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:18,836

to trade pants with me.

-Hang on.

161
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,070
130/80. That's a little high.

162
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,155
We can attribute that to the stress
of sneaking past the security desk.

163
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,994
Where did you get the stethoscope
and pressure cuff?

164
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,754
My Aunt Marion gave them to me
for my 12th birthday.

165
00:09:44,319 --> 00:09:46,355
She thought if I failed
at theoretical physics...

166
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,431
...that I should have a trade
to fall back on.

167
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:52,996
And by the way. the blood pressure cuff
is called a sphygmomanometer.

168
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:56,472

-Didn't teach you that in medical school?

All I need is for you to authorize
these tests.

Ha. A cardiac stress test.
a full-body MRI. an electromyogram...

...a CBC. baseline glucose. upper GI?

173
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,197
Oh. and exploratory laparoscopy.
The last time I had hiccups...

174
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,193
...it felt like my diaphragm
was just going through the motions.

Go home. Sheldon.

176
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,638
Can I at least have the upper GI?

177
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,669
I already drank the barium.
