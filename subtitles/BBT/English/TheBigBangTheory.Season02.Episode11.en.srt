Your argument is lacking
in all scientific merit.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,398
And it is well-established...

3
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:08,756
...Superman cleans his uniform
by flying into Earth's yellow sun...

4
00:00:08,919 --> 00:00:10,910
...which incinerates
any contaminant matter...

5
00:00:11,079 --> 00:00:15,197
...and leaves the invulnerable Kryptcnian
fabric unharmed and daisy fresh.

Kryptonian on it?

7
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:22,313
-Like what?
-I don't know. Kryptonian mustard.

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,438
I think we can assume all Kryptonian
condiments were destroyed...

9
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,067
...when the planet Krypton exploded.

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,071

Superman's body is Kryptonian.
therefore his sweat is Kryptonian.

Yeah. what about Kryptonian pit stains?

15

Okay. He's invited for dinner
in the bottle city of Kandor.

17

He miniaturizes himself. enters the city.
where he loses his super-powers.

18

Before dinner. his host says.
“Who's up for Kryptonian tetherball?“

19

Superman works up a sweat. comes back
to Earth. his uniform now stained...

Kryptonian perspiration.

Booyah.

22
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:10,557
Superman would have taken his uniform
to a Kandorian dry-cleaner...

23

...before he left the bottle.

24
