-He slipped and fell.
-Yes.

343
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,273
I slipped and fell.

344
00:18:49,439 --> 00:18:50,713
In the bathroom.

345
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,711
Bounced right off the tub.

346
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,070
Yes. Now he knows
what bathtubs are capable of doing...

347
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,071
...when you don't treat them
with respect.

348
00:18:58,559 --> 00:18:59,958
Yeah.

349
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,038
They sucker-punch you
when your eyes are closed.

350
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:06,397
So. what do you think. Howard?

351
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,550
It-- It's not that bad. right?

352
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,951
Yeah. no.
A little electrical tape. some solder--

353
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,633
Are you insane?

354
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:15,710
I've seen space probes
that crashed into...

355
00:19:15,879 --> 00:19:18,154
...the desert that were
in better shape than this.

356
00:19:19,439 --> 00:19:20,713
You're right.

357
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,279
Monte's gone.

358
00:19:22,439 --> 00:19:25,636
We'll bury him in the morning.
A simple ceremony. I'll speak.

359
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:28,309
Leonard. you'll play your cello.

360
00:19:29,199 --> 00:19:31,713
Sheldon. honey. aren't you getting
a little carried away?

361
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,233
I mean. it's just a toy robot.

362
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,351
Just a toy robot?

363
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:44,268
Penny.

364
00:19:44,439 --> 00:19:45,633
I know. I got it.

365
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,876
Sheldon? I'm sorry.

366
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:53,272
Well. don't get the wrong idea.

367
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:56,715
The way I see it.
I'm halfway to pity sex.

368
