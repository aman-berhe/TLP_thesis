Mm.

00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:07,467
Gentlemen. I put it to you:

3
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:08,867
The worst tapioca pudding...

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,715
...is better than the best pudding
of any other flavor.

5
00:00:13,479 --> 00:00:17,154
First off. that is axiomatically wrong
because the best pudding is chocolate.

6
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:20,548
Secondly. the organic structure
of tapioca makes it...

7
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:22,391
...a jiggling bowl of potential death.

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,391

shopping at Ralphs.

Wow. you'd think a guy like that
would have some kind of booze lackey.

All right. this is cruel.

before his head explodes.

All right. Sheldon. why is tapioca--?

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,908
Tapioca is extracted
from the root of Manihut esculenta.

20
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:56,876
Due to a high concentration of cyanide...

21

and lethal if prepared improperly.
