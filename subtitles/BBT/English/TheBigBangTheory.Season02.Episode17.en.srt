-Of course I haven't.

...and anisotropy of the cosmic
microwave background radiation...

34
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:43,756
...cemented our understanding
of the origin of the universe.

35
00:01:43,919 --> 00:01:45,511
It's kind of a funny name though.

Oh. cool.

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,516
Yeah. cool. Seven times as long as flying
and costs almost twice as much.

42
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,189
-Well then why are you doing it?
-Well. we had a vote.

43
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:11,668
Three voted for airplane.
Sheldon voted for train.

44
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,195
So we're taking the train.

...l was gonna give to George Smoot
at the conference.

169
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,519
Why do you have to give your paper
to George Smoot?

170
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,399
lt's brilliant. He needs to read it.

171
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,271
So you'll send him an email
when we get back.

172
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:02,431
Then I won't get to see
his face light up as he reads it.

173
00:09:02,599 --> 00:09:05,318
-Right. Of course.
-Oh. this is an unmitigated disaster.

174
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,040
Well, there's nothing you can do about it.
so relax.

175
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,398
Sit back. enjoy the clickety-clack
of the steel wheels on the polished rails.

You forgot your ﬂash drive

Only 10 hours. 55 minutes to go.

You forgot your ﬂash drive
You forgot your ﬂash drive

00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,720
It's hot in here. Must be Summer.

182
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,392
So. where you gals headed?

183
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,911
Okay. I've found the perfect solution.

184
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,230
We get off the train at the next stop
in Oxnard.

185
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,596
We then take the 1:13 train
back to Union Station.

00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:04,750
We take a cab back.

187
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:08,878
...and race to San Luis Obispo. assuming
the lights are with us. minimal traffic...

188
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,359
...we'll meet the train.

189
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,956
-|'ve got a better idea.
-Are you going to be sarcastic?

190
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,078
Boy. you take all the fun out of it for me.

191
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,275
But. look. Penny's home.

192
00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:22,114
Why don't we call her. have her get
your flash drive and e-mail you the paper?

193
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,669
But the flash drive
is in a locked drawer in my desk.

194
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:26,909
-So?
-The key is hidden in my room.

195
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,832
-So?
-Penny'd have to go into my room.

196
00:10:28,999 --> 00:10:31,388
-So?
-People don't go in my room.

197
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:34,030
I see. Well. it seems once again...

198
00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:37,396
...you're caught
between a rock and a crazy place.

199
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,672
Oh. I hate when that happens.

00:10:42,719 --> 00:10:45,711
It's hot in here. Must be Summer.
It's hot in here. Must be summer.

201
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,870
It's hot in here. Must be Summer.

202
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,508
It's hot in here. Must be Summer.

203
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,314
-That's cute.
-Really? I just made it up.

204
00:10:56,199 --> 00:10:58,429
Have you seen Slumdog Millionaire?

205
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,235
Oh yeah. I loved it.

206
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,152
It's loosely based on my life.

207
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,717
We're putting the play on for one night
in this little 99-seat theater.

208
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,916
Can you come? Oh. great.

209
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:14,071
Do you know 98 other people
that might wanna come?

210
00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:16,509
Oh. hang on. Hello?

211
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,035
Listen. I'm about to give you
a set of instructions...

212
00:11:19,199 --> 00:11:20,996
...which you must follow to the letter.

213
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,354
Just a sec.

214
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,034
Theater's above a bowling alley
so it's a little noisy...

215
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:28,953
...but it might be the only chance
I'll ever get to play Anne Frank.

216
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,073
And the director is brilliant.

217
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,516
He uses the bowling sounds
as. like. Nazi artillery.

218
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,591
Okay. great. I'll see you then.

219
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:39,512
-He||o?
SHELDON: Okay, step Iour.

220
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,077
Do you see that small plastic case
on my dresser?

221
00:11:43,439 --> 00:11:44,997
Your dresser? Who is this?

222
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:46,588
It's Sheldon.

223
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:49,068
PENNY: Oh. hey. Sheldon.
How's San Francisco?

224
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:53,352
I'm not in San Francisco. I'm on a tra--
Were you even listening to me?

225
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,350
No. I was talking to my friend.
What's up?

226
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,112
What's up? I'll tell you what's up.

227
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,508
I'm in a crisis situation...

228
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,116
...I need you to marshal your powers
of concentration. limited as they may be--

229
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,032
Give me the phone.

230
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,635
Hi. Penny. it's Leonard.

231
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,951
Hey. Leonard. what's going on
with Dr. Wackadoodle?

232
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:13,433
He's calling to ask you a favor.
You might be confused...

233
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,309
...because he didn't use the words
“Penny." "Sheldon." “please“ or “favor.“

234
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,630
Okay. Enough chitchat.

235
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,276
Okay. step one: Locate your emergency
key to our apartment.

236
00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:27,876
Step two: Enter our apartment.
Step three....

237
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,033
Enter my bedroom.

238
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:32,828
SHELDON: Step four--
-Yeah. hang on. getting another call.

239
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:34,432
No!

240
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,717
Let me tell you something. Personal
robots cannot get here soon enough.

241
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:44,834
And that bright little star
peeking her head out early today...

242
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:46,910
...that's Venus.

243
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:48,353
That is so cool.

244
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,433
You know a lot about space.

245
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:56,517
Come on. When you were on TV in Fireﬂy.
you were actually in space.

246
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,111
You're not one of those guys
who believe that?

247
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,917
You mean one of the hopeless geeks?
No.

248
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,433
Those are crazy people.

and get me another one of these.

251
00:13:15,719 --> 00:13:18,108
Now him. he's one of those geeks.

252
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,068
All right. now before you enter
my bedroom unescorted...

253
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,232
...I need you to understand
that this one time grant of access...

254
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,392
...does not create a permanent easement.

255
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:30,148
Easement.

256
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:34,631
It's a legal right of access. Good grief.

Normally around women.
he has the personality of a boiled potato.

260
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,431
Put one beer in him.
and he's M. Knight Charmalarmalon.

261
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,195
Is that what he's drinking?
It's not even real beer.

262
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,509
-What?
-Look at it.

263
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,475
Non-alcoholic beer.

-Then what's going on?
-I don't know.

265
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,434
Some sort of placebo effect. I guess.

266
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:08,910
Placebo. you say.

267
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,036
Interesting.

268
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,667
Yes. I'm still here.
Where am I going? I'm on a train.

269
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,229
Now. what you'll be looking for
is a small wooden box...

270
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:22,427
...located between a Hoberman Sphere
and a sample of quartz flecked with pyrite.

271
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,158
Hoberman Sphere.

272
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,676
It's a collapsible icosidodecahedron.

273
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,831
No. the thing with the time on it
is my alarm clock. My God.

274
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,357
Actually. in India.
the names of constellations are different.

275
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:42,116
Where you have the Big Dipper.
we have the Big Curry Pot.

276
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,949
You're making that up.

277
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,111
You got me.

278
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,510
Now. what are you going to do with me?

279
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,476
-Raj. Look.
-Yes?

280
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,436
-What am I looking at?
-You tell me.

281
00:14:56,999 --> 00:14:59,559
Non-alcoholic beer.

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,747
Hi. I'm the small package
good things come in.

283
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,995
Okay. I got a box. but there's no key
in here. Just letters.

284
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:18,672
That's the wrong box. Put it back.

285
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:21,478
Oh. Sheldon. are these letters
from your grandmother?

286
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:22,992
Don't read those letters.

287
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:26,151
Oh. look. she calls you Moon Pie.
That is so cute.

288
00:15:26,319 --> 00:15:28,230

290
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:34,317
Hey. Leonard. How's the train ride?

291
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,790
Delightful. I don't know
what you're doing right now...

292
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:41,235
...but there are little bubbles forming
in the corner of Sheldon's mouth.

293
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:44,197
Okay. Yeah. I kind of crossed a line.
Put him back on.

294
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,509
Thank you.

00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:49,478
-|'m back.
-What up. Moon Pie?

296
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:53,230
No one calls me Moon Pie but Meemaw.

297
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:57,029
Hey. Penny. Leonard again.

298
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,956
So anyway. in the dream. you and I
were ice skating. just the two of us.

299
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,190
And then I picked you up
by your ankles...

300
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,672
...and twirled you round and round
until your legs tore off.

301
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,990
I mean. I tried to stick them back on.
but before I could...

302
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:18,675
...you turned into a giant loaf
of pumpernickel bread.

303
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:20,238
What do you think that means?

304
00:16:21,599 --> 00:16:23,749
I really don't know.

305
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,239
I'll give you a little clue.

306
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,675
My favorite sandwich?
Salami on pumpernickel.

307
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,629
Is that so?

308
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,318
Did you know the word
pumpernickel comes...

309
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,232
...from the German words
pumper and knickel.

310
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,630
Which loosely translates to fart goblin?

311
00:16:40,439 --> 00:16:43,237
No. I didn't.

312
00:16:45,999 --> 00:16:47,876
Okay. I found the box. Now what?

313
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:53,319
You're holding a Japanese puzzle box.
which takes 10 precise moves to open.

314
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,552
Okay. first locate the
panel with the diamond pattern...

315
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,269
...and slide the center portion
1 millimeter to the left.

316
00:17:00,439 --> 00:17:02,430
Then. on the opposite end of the box...

317
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,592
...slide the entire panel
down 2 millimeters.

318
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,557
You'll hear a slight click.

319
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,235
Hang on. Sheldon. do you have
any emotional attachment to this box?

320
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,631
No. It's a novelty I ordered off
the Internet. Did you hear the click?

321
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,358
Not yet.

322
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:21,231
There it is.

323
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:25,958
Okay. here's another one.

324
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:29,954
If you married the famous rock guitarist
Johnny Winter...

325
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:32,349
...you'd be Summer Winter.

326
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,036
-Uh-huh.
-Yep.

327
00:17:36,439 --> 00:17:40,955
Okay. I'm gonna just go for broke here
and say I like you.

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,633
Yeah?

329
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,513
So here's my question:

330
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:48,832
Do you see any conversational path that
would take us from where we are now...

331
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,594
...to a place where I could ask you out
and you'd say yes?

332
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,679
No.

333
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,670
Fair enough. I'll leave you in peace.

334
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,398
Thank you.

335
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,670
But before I go...

336
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,957
...would you mind if I just take one picture
of us together for my Facebook page?

337
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,473
Sure.

338
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,798
Okay. Great.

339
00:18:21,959 --> 00:18:24,268
Can I take one
where it looks like we're making out?

340
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:32,193
Okay. now you're going to insert
the flash drive into the USB port.

342
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,753
She calls me Moon Pie
because I'm nummy-nummy...

343
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,433
...and she could just eat me up.

344
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,957
Now please put the flash drive
in the USB port.

345
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,319
The one that looks like
a little duck's mouth.

346
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,472
-Hey. how'd it go?
-Terminator broke my phone.

347
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:03,037
Excuse me.

348
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,799
Okay. I'll be honest with you.

349
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:09,110
I've spent the last two hours imagining
various scenarios in my head...

350
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:11,713
...trying to come up with some line
to say to you...

351
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,997
...but then I finally realized
you're a human being. I'm a human being.

352
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:16,148
I could just say--

CONDUCTOR [ON PA]:
Next stop, Santa Barbara.

354
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,436
I'm sorry. This is me.

“Hi. my name's Leonard.“

356
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:31,349
So I'm thinking you won the Nobel Prize.
what. three years ago...

357
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,796
...so you must deal with a whole lot
of “What has Smoot done lately?“

358
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,711
My thought is we continue my research
as a team. you know...

359
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,472
...Cooper-Smoot. alphabetical...

360
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,633
...and when we win the Nobel Prize.
you'll be back on top.

361
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,800
With all due respect. Dr. Cooper.
are you on crack?

362
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,915
Fine. Smoot-Cooper.

363
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,640
Wow. what a diva.
