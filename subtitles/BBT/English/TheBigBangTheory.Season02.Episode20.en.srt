[GROANS]

00:00:11,239 --> 00:00:13,150
[CONTINUES GROANING]

3
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:16,917
Problem?

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,037
-This is Thai food.
-Here we go.

5
00:00:20,599 --> 00:00:23,397
We don't have Thai food on Thursday.
We have pizza on Thursday.

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,120
Yes. but we all agreed
the third Thursday of every month...

7
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,235
...would be
Anything Can Happen Thursday.

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,392
The news didn't reach my digestive
system which. when startled...

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,632
...has its own version
of Anything Can Happen Thursday.

10
00:00:35,839 --> 00:00:38,399
The whole idea behind
Anything Can Happen Thursday...

11
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,437
...is to get out of this rut
we've been in.

12
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,114
Rut? I think you mean consistency.

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,033
And if we're going to abandon that.
why even call it Thursday?

14
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:50,511
Let's call it “Ouonko Day“ and divide it
into 29 hours of 17 minutes a piece...

15
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:54,194
...and celebrate it by sacrificing a goat
to the mighty god Ra.

16
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,792
I could go for some goat.

17
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:02,916
Sheldon. we agreed we'd do something
different tonight.

18
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,594
All right. Let's go
to the comic book store.

19
00:01:05,759 --> 00:01:07,636
We went to the comic book store
last night.

20
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:10,267
Last night was Wednesday.
Wednesday is comic-book night.

21
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:15,638
We'll be going on Thursday because
it's Anything Can Happen Thursday.

22
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,113
Way to think outside but pressed
right up against the box. Sheldon.

23
00:01:20,279 --> 00:01:21,632
What are we gonna do tonight?

24
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,916
If I may proffer a suggestion...

25
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:28,869
...in bars all across this great nation
of ours. Thursday night is Ladies' Night.

26
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:31,837
As the evening progresses.
we will get better-looking...

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,753
...courtesy of 99-cent margaritas
and two-for-one Jell-O shots.

28
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,919
Come on. Howard. the odds of us picking
up girls in a bar are practically zero.

29
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,274
Oh. Really? Are you
familiar with the Drake equation?

30
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:46,999
The one that estimates the odds
of contact with extraterrestrials...

31
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,798
...by calculating the product
of series of fractional values...

32
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:52,269
...such as stars
with planets likely to develop life?

33
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:56,990
N equals R times FP times NE times FL
times Fl times FC times L?

34
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,759
Yeah. that one.

35
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,117
You can modify it
to calculate our chances of having sex...

36
00:02:10,279 --> 00:02:13,112
...by changing the formula
to use single women in Los Angeles...

37
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:15,076
...those who might find us attractive...

38
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,755
...and what I call
The Wolowitz Coefficient.

39
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,352
-The Wolowitz Coefficient?
-Neediness times dress-size squared.

40
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:25,868
ln crunching the numbers...

41
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,918
...I come up with a conservative
5812 potential sex partners...

42
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,512
...within a 40-mile radius.

43
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,113
You're joking.

44
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,720
I'm a horny engineer. Leonard.

45
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,269
I never joke about math or sex.

46
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:42,837
Well. what are we waiting for?
Let's bounce. bitches.

47
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,398
Oh. you're right.
It's Anything Can Happen Thursday.

48
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,312
Let's hit the clubs
and meet hot women.

49
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,314
Here we go. Lock up your daughters.
We're gonna hit it and quit it.

50
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,271
Or we could finish eating
and go to the comic book store.

51
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,751
Also a good plan.

52
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:07,957
But next Anything Can Happen Thursday.
we're going to a bar.

53
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,554
-Oh. absolutely.
-You heard that. Ladies' Night ladies?

54
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,109
We're eventually coming for you.

55
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,349
Fascinating.

56
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:46,387
-Oh. hey. guys. Where you headed?
-To the comic book store.

57
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,437
You're thinking.
“The comic book store on a Thursday?

58
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,511
Why. I've fallen down the rabbit hole
and into a land of madness.“

59
00:03:52,679 --> 00:03:54,431
What you have failed
to take into account...

60
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,797
...is that this is
Anything Can Happen Thursday.

61
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:00,352
You got me.

62
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,512
Oh. hey. could you pick me up
a few comics for my nephew's birthday?

63
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,591
No. I think you mean comic books.

64
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,591
Comics are feeble attempts at humor...

65
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:10,398
...featuring talking babies
and anthropomorphized pets...

66
00:04:10,559 --> 00:04:14,677
...found traditionally in the
optimistically named “funny pages.“

67
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,629
Leonard. pick me up comics
for my nephew's birthday?

68
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,071
-Sure. What does he like?
-I don't know. just pick out anything.

69
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:23,548
Just pick out anything?

70
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,470
Maybe we can pick out a new suit
for him without knowing his size...

71
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:30,153
...or pick out his career
without knowing his aptitude...

72
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:34,073
...or pick out a new breakfast cereal
without knowing his fiber requirements...

73
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,757
...or his feelings
about little marshmallows.

74
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,758
Spider-Man. Get him Spider-Man.

75
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,718
Amazing Spider-Man, Ultimate
Spider-Man, Spectacular Spider-Man. . .

76
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:47,315
The Marvelous Adventures
of Spider-Man. Spider-Man 2099?

77
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,950
-Leonard?
LEONARD: This can go on all night.

78
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,190
Why don't you just come with us?

79
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,233
Ugh. That's what I was trying to avoid.

80
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:58,872
Oh. I forgot Sensational Spider-Man.

81
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,674
Oh. what a cute little store.

82
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,435
Everybody's staring at me.

83
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,831
Don't worry. They're more
scared of you than you are of them.

84
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,035
Unlikely.

85
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,751
Here. What about this one
for my nephew?

86
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,115
-A superb choice.
-Oh. great.

87
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,272
Yeah. provided he has already read
Infinite Crisis and 52...

88
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,716
...and is familiar with the
reestablishment of the DC Multiverse.

89
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,673
Uh. what's a Multiverse?

90
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,997
Get her out of here.

91
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,309
Come on. I'll help you pick something.

92
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,233
That's right. She's with us.

93
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,991
Guys like that are so pathetic.

94
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,513
Tell me about it.

95
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,117
Ooh. look. a new Batman belt buckle.

96
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,711
Oh. hey. Leonard.
| help you find something?

97
00:05:56,879 --> 00:05:59,677
Oh. hey. Stuart. This is Penny.
She's just looking for some comic books.

98
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,799
Oh. really? Wow. Blink twice
if you're here against your will.

99
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,913
I think we're fine. Stuart.

100
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,477
-Okay. Let me know if you need anything.
-Thanks.

101
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,551
Oh. he seems like a nice guy.

102
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,515
You mean for someone
who's into comic books?

103
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:19,194
No. no. no. ljust meant for-- Yeah.

104
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:23,116
Just because people appreciate comic
books doesn't make them weirdoes.

105
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,875
Stuart's a terrific artist. He went
to the Rhode Island School of Design.

106
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,189
Okay. what about the guy...

107
00:06:28,359 --> 00:06:30,953
...in the superhero T-shirt
tucked into his sweatpants?

108
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:34,710
Oh. yeah. that's Captain Sweatpants.

109
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,317
He doesn't really help the point
I'm trying to make.

110
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,794
-Got it. got it. got it.
-Got it. got it. got it.

111
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:46,427
-Got it. got it. got it.
-Got it. got it. got it.

112
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:49,272
-Got it. got it. got it.
-Got it. got it. got it.

113
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:51,873
-Got it. got it. got it.
-Got it. got it. got it.

114
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,838
-Got it. got it. got it.
-Got it. got it. got it.

115
00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:56,478
-Need it.
-Need it.

116
00:06:58,799 --> 00:07:01,472
-Let it go. Sheldon.
-Why should I let it go? I saw it first.

117
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:04,870
-Yes. but I saw it from the front.
-A far less impressive feat.

118
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,554
Oh. come on. I need this
for my Batman collection.

119
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:10,791
-I need it for my Rubin collection.
-Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock?

120
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,711
Why would I gamble? lt's mine. Let go.

121
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,313
-You let go.
-No. you.

122
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,948
-Prob|em?
-Yes. He won't let go of my comic book.

123
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,350
-|t's my comic book.
-Leonard. we need a ruling.

124
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,952
Uh. cut it in half?

125
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:24,790
-Excuse me.
-Oh. hello again.

126
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:28,076
Hi. What would you recommend
as a present for a 13-year-old boy?

127
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,594
A 13-year-old girl.

128
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,954
[LAUGHS]

129
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,557
But if you're dead set
on a comic book. try this.

130
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,870
Oh. "Hellblazer. " What's this about?

131
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,237
A morally ambiguous confidence man
who smokes. has lung cancer...

132
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:45,709
...and is tormented
by the spirits of the undead.

133
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,111
Well. if that doesn't make me the
favorite aunt. I don't know what will.

134
00:07:51,999 --> 00:07:53,830
Is this me?

135
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,074
Depends. Do you like it?

136
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,472
-Wow. it's really good.
-Yes. that's you.

137
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,789
That's so sweet.
But what if I didn't like it?

138
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:06,792
lt'd still be you. but I'd feel like an idiot.

139
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,436
I don't believe it.
Stuart's putting the moves on Penny.

140
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,239
l have got to learn how to draw.

141
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,519
Hey.

142
00:08:16,679 --> 00:08:20,467
Once again. defeated
by your own prurient interests.

143
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,756
Guys. have you seen Stuart all up
in Penny's business over there?

144
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,832
Nobody's up in anybody's business.
Let's just buy our stuff and go.

145
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:31,036
Okay. you've got my number.
Now give me the picture.

146
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,872
All right. You drive a hard bargain...

147
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:37,915
-...but here.
-All right. So. um. just give me a call.

148
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:44,558
So Leonard. how are you enjoying
Anything Can Happen Thursday?

149
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,076
Look at that. That's a dent.

150
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,395
Thank you.
Howard “Ham-Fisted“ Wolowitz.

151
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,198
Did you shut the TV off
in the middle of the Deep Space Nine...

152
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,952
...Star Trek: The Original Series...

153
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,315
...“Trouble With Tribbles“
crossover episode?

154
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,516
Apparently so.

155
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,356
Are you ill?

156
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,918
No.

157
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,559
All right.

158
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,996
Then is it fair to say that you're
experiencing some emotional turmoil...

159
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,628
...over the events involving Penny
earlier this evening?

160
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,395
When did you pick up on that?

161
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,636
A moment ago. you turned off the TV
in the middle of the Deep Space Nine...

162
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,279
...Star Trek: The Original Series...

163
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:32,475
...“Trouble With Tribbles“
crossover episode.

164
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,316
Would you like some advice?

165
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,349
