171
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:01,630
-Okay.
-You know. guys come on to her...

172
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,156
...all the time. so you need to. like.
set yourself apart. you know?

173
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,833
Be a little shy.

174
00:09:06,999 --> 00:09:10,628
And don't make too much eye contact.

175
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,109
And you know. treat her with. like.
cool detachment.

176
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,511
And. you know. fear.

177
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,954
-Fear?
LEONARD: Yeah.

178
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,955
Like you're afraid
that if you touch her. she'll break.

179
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,157
Well.
that plays right into my wheelhouse.

180
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,473
Good. good.
Well. you kids have fun tonight.

181
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:31,038
Thanks. Leonard.

182
00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:32,757
What is that thing anyway?

183
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,238
You don't know what this is?

184
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,277
-No.
-Good. get out.

185
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,190
Be afraid of Penny. Nice. very crafty.

186
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,911
It wasn't bad advice.
It just wasn't particularly helpful.

187
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:53,153
For what it's worth. my mother says
that when we deceive for personal gain...

188
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,470
...we make Jesus cry.

189
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,673
All right. what if we use
this two-inch PVC...

190
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,511
...to reinforce the center cross-support?

191
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,877
No good. I mean. it might work
for the Japanese and the Americans...

192
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,952
...but have you seen the size
of the Russians they got up there?

193
00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:22,229
This thing has to hold up
against a hearty potato-based diet.

194
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:24,351
| feel terrible.

195
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:27,670
Maybe if you were helping.
you'd feel better about yourself.

196
00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:31,396
l deliberately tried to sabotage
Stuart's date with Penny.

197
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,916
Of course you feel terrible. You
completely screwed up your karma. dude.

198
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:37,434
You don't really believe
in that superstition. do you?

199
00:10:37,599 --> 00:10:40,318
It's not superstition.
it's practically Newtonian.

200
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:43,194
For every action.
there's an equal and opposite reaction.

201
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,035
Leonard pretends to be a friend.
and acts like a two-faced bitch.

202
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:51,877
Therefore. he is reborn as a banana slug.

203
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,915
It's actually a very elegant system. You
know. what goes around comes around.

204
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,877
Speaking of what goes around
comes around....

205
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,588
Okay. look.

206
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,399
Instead of trying to reinforce
this structure here...

207
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,869
...what if we ran another line.
bypassed it entirely?

208
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:10,553
Won't work.
The diameter of the tubing is insufficient.

209
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,630
What if we reposition
the collection tank?

210
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,313
It won't work. No way to mount it.

211
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,516
Here's an idea.
What if I change my name...

212
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:19,398
...and go live with my cousin
and her husband. Avi. in Israel?

213
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,959
That could work.

214
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,312
-Morning.
-Morning. What's up?

215
00:11:30,479 --> 00:11:35,269
Nothing. We just pulled an all-nighter
trying to fix a Zero-Gravity pasta maker.

216
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,313
-|'m gonna make a coffee run. Want any?
-No. l have coffee.

217
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,755
Great.
so how'd it go with Stuart last night?

218
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,272
I really don't wanna talk about it.

219
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:47,952
Yeah. Right. Sure.

220
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,588
But. you know. the thing is.
before you guys went out...

221
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,433
-I spoke to him and |--
-I said I don't wanna talk about it.

222
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,556
-Okay. I kind of feel res--
-Look. Leonard.

223
00:11:55,719 --> 00:11:58,916
What goes on is none of your business.
So just leave it alone. okay?

224
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:07,838
If you really want to clean up
your karma. go get my freaking latte.

225
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:17,549
Hang on. I think I've got this.

226
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,792
Help me see if we can wedge
this piece of PVC behind the support rod.

227
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,475
You're overestimating the strength
of the substructure you're building.

228
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,631
-Sheldon. I know what I'm doing.
-If you knew what you were doing...

229
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,792
...there wouldn't be a space toilet
where my coffee table should be.

230
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,639
Howard. wait.

231
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,634
Why don't you use this instead of the
PVC to keep the filter assembly in place?

232
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:40,513
Because this is not a spare part
from the space station.

233
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:44,831
This is the thing from the pizza box that
keeps the lid from touching the cheese.

234
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,670
Is that what that's for?
In India. the lid just touches the cheese.

235
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:51,717
We also have rampant poverty
and periodic outbreaks of cholera...

236
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:54,313
...so a little cardboard in our cheese
is no biggie.

237
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,151
-Where you going?
-Comic-book store.

238
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,787
Oh. an excellent idea.
I could certainly use a break.

239
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,030
-Me too.
-You can go to the comic book store...

240
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,350
...when man can once again
safely poop in space.

241
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,593
Why does Leonard get to go?

242
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:09,954
Because he's upset
over his situation with Penny.

243
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,715
And if I have to hear about it again.
I'm gonna kick him in his ovaries.

244
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:17,112
-Thanks for understanding. Howard.
HOWARD: I got your back. sister.

245
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:22,437
All right. I think we've got a prototype
ready to test. Hand me that Tupperware.

246
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,472
-That's heavy.
-Damn right. it's heavy.

247
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:26,867
It's my mother's meatloaf.

248
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,152
It's been testing toilets for generations.

249
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:32,834
I must say. Howard...

250
00:13:32,999 --> 00:13:36,355
...I think a detailed letter to MIT
describing your current circumstances...

251
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:39,556
...might entitle you to a refund
on your Master's degree.

252
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:45,434
Okay. simulated zero-gravity human
waste disposal test with meatloaf analog.

253
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,478
In three. two. one.

254
00:13:55,439 --> 00:13:57,669
Fascinating.

255
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:00,670
What do you think the problem is?

256
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,399
Not enough bread crumbs.

257
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:12,518
-Hey. Stuart. I need to talk to you.
-Sure. what's up?

258
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,831
I think I gave you some bad advice
about Penny and I want to apologize.

259
00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:17,148
No. your advice was great.

260
00:14:17,319 --> 00:14:19,674
-It was?
-Oh. yeah. going slow really worked.

261
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,673
You're kidding.

262
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,151
Never worked for me.

263
00:14:24,319 --> 00:14:26,549
Yeah. last night at dinner
I did what you told me.

264
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,359
I went really slow. I kept my distance...

265
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,430
...and two bottles of wine later.
we were making out in my car.

266
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:35,829
Wine? I didn't say to give her wine.

267
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,635
It doesn't matter.
That's where it all went to hell.

268
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,028
During the kissing?

269
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:43,953
What did you do. sneeze in her mouth?
I did that to a girl once.

270
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,913
No. everything was good and really hot.

271
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,913
And I said. oh. Penny...

272
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,436
...and right where she was supposed
to say. "Oh. Stuart“ she said...

273
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:57,317
. . .your name.

274
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:03,557
-Leonard?
-That is your name. right?

275
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:05,994
Yeah. No. yeah. it is.

276
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,718
Wow. I'm sorry.

277
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:10,188
That must've been the last thing
you wanted to hear.

278
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,478
Well. it beats.
“You know I'm a dude. right?“

279
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,391
Yeah. it was pretty bad.

280
00:15:18,999 --> 00:15:20,876
No doubt. no doubt.

281
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,838
Okay. well...

282
00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:27,752
-...|'m sorry it didn't work out.
-Not your fault.

283
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:29,791
Yeah. how about that?

284
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,033
-See you soon.
-Yep. sure.

285
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,598
Yes. I understand. Classified.
We'll keep it all classified.

286
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,114
No one has to know anything about this
but you and me.

287
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,315
What's classified?

288
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:58,477
Howard's space toilet. I'll tell you later.

289
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:04,110
Well. they've deployed our solution.
Let's just all hope it works.

290
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,998
I don't see why I have to worry.

291
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,311
My career's not hanging in the balance.

292
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,631
That was a joke.

293
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:20,394
It's funny because it's true.

294
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,229
Leonard.
could you pass the soy sauce. please?

295
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,391
-|'m sorry. were you talking to me?
-Yeah. I said Leonard.

296
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,430
Yes. you did. didn't you?

297
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,432
What the hell is that?

298
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:42,637
Meatloaf.

299
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,351
What was it doing on the ceiling?

300
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,957
That's classified.
