agreement that I not criticize your work.

00:00:13,159 --> 00:00:17,949
-Then what was “Oh. boy“?
-Great restraint on my part.

There's nothing wrong
with the science here.

6
00:00:20,599 --> 00:00:24,990
Perhaps you mean a different thing
than I do when you say “science.“

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,754
Okay. how's that?

8
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,390
You actually had it right
in the first place.

00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,276
Well. now. here's a peculiar e-mail.

12
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,353
The president of the university wants me
to meet him at his office at 8 a.m.

13
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:56,477
-Why?
-Doesn't say. Must be an emergency.

Why does everybody keep telling me
what time it is?

28
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,912
-Everybody?
-You. the president of the university...

time it is and whether people know it.

You went to President Seibert's house
in the middle of the night?

He didn't respond to my e-mail.
his phone number is unlisted.

to the National Science Foundation...

...to detect slow-moving monopoles

Yes.
In fact. he was quite enthusiastic.

He said. "Frankly.

Okay. Well. do you wanna go?

Of course not.
I'm a theoretical physicist.

A career I chose in no small part
because it's indoors.

magnetic monopoles there...

...I will be the scientist

-Then don't go.

Odd. President Seibert posed
the exact same question.

How was it resolved?

72
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,797
It wasn't. His wife set their dogs on me
and rendered the question moot.

73
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,710
Just imagine. If he says yes...

74
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,316
...we'll have an entire summer
without Sheldon.

75
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,515
We could play outside.

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,148
We could sit

77
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:36,913
I could use the bathroom at 8:20.

Thank you.
but your sentiments may be premature.

84
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,709
Oh. I don't like where this is going.

00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,756

-To the North Pole?
-Yes.

88
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,757
Is this just so we won't touch your stuff
while you're away?

89
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:22,549
I'll admit that was a concern.

90
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,191
But the fact is. I'll need a support team
and the three of you are my first choice.

-Others might be more qualified...

92

...but the thought of interviewing them
gave me a stomachache.

93
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,115
I know I'm proposing
an enormous undertaking...

94
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:39,192
...so why don't you take a few moments
to discuss it?

95

to the North Pole with him. are we?

96
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:46,394

I'm still within earshot.

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,914
Hang on. let's talk about it. This is a
National Science Foundation expedition.

101
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,957
I don't know
how we can turn it down.

102
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,954
Easy. Instead of saying. "No. we don't
wanna go on an NSF expedition." say:

103
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:07,590
“No. we don't wanna spend three months
stuck in a cabin in the Arctic Circle...

104

...with an anal nutbag.“
