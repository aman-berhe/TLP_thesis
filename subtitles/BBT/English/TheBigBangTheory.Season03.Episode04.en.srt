[GREMLINS CHITTERING ON TV]

2
00:00:05,159 --> 00:00:07,514
This movie baffles me
every time we watch it.

3
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:08,907
What do you mean?

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,629
The instructions are very clear.
Don't feed the gremlins after midnight.

5
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:16,839
Don't get the gremlins wet.

6
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:20,549
How hard is that?

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,915
Hi, guys.

8
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:24,114
-Hi, honey.
-Hey.

9
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:26,588
Oh, we're "honey" now, are we?

10
00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:29,034
Yes. Since their relationship
became carnal...

11
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,759
...Penny has upgraded
his designated term of endearment...

12
00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:34,353
...distinguishing him
from those she calls "sweetie"...

13
00:00:34,519 --> 00:00:37,636
...in an attempt to soften
a thinly veiled insult.

14
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,873
You're boring people, sweetie.

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,716
Although sometimes
she omits the veil entirely.

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,113
-So, what are you guys doing?
-Celebrating Columbus Day.

17
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,477
We're watching Goonies, Gremlins
and Young Sherlock Holmes.

18
00:00:51,639 --> 00:00:53,914
They're all written by Chris Columbus.

19
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:57,753
Okay. What do you watch
on Thanksgiving?

20
00:00:57,919 --> 00:00:59,796
The parade.

21
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:04,197
That reminds me. I usually go back
to Nebraska for Thanksgiving.

22
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,318
But they're calling it off
on account of my brother's trial.

23
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:10,994
-What's he on trial for?
-Oh, just a big misunderstanding.

24
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:14,117
You know, you'd like my brother.
He's kind of a chemist.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,911
lwas thinking
I'd have Thanksgiving here.

26
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,149
-And you are all invited.
-Oh, I'll be there.

27
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,154
Will you be serving cranberryjelly
or cranberry sauce?

28
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:26,873
I guess I could serve both.

29
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:30,827
You guess? You don't seem
to have much of a handle on this.

30
00:01:31,839 --> 00:01:34,228
Yeah, I really wish I could,
Penny, but every year...

31
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:39,189
...my mother has all the relatives over
and cooks up her famous tur-briska-fil.

32
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,273
Tur-briska-fil?

33
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,597
A turkey stuffed with a brisket
stuffed with gefilte fish.

34
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,993
It's not as good as it sounds.

35
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:50,947
Raj, what about you?

36
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,871
Oh, he usually comes
to my house. Right, pal?

37
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,992
[5035]

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,834
Uh, all right. This year,
you don't have to eat the tur-briska-fil.

39
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:04,634
I don't even chew it.
I swallow it like pills.

40
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,959
So, what's going on with Raj?

41
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,799
Well, the good news
is he has no problem...

42
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:37,870
...with my mother's tur-briska-fil.

43
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,759
Hard to believe, but go on.

44
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:43,433
The bad news
is he says he's getting deported.

45
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,352
What do you mean
he's getting deported?

46
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,229
I believe it means the U.S. government
is going to expel him from the country.

47
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,518
He could return to India, immigrate to
another country willing to accept him...

48
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:56,273
...or wander the high seas
as a stateless pirate.

49
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,516
Personally, I'd choose pirate.

50
00:03:02,999 --> 00:03:05,638
Penny, would you mind stepping outside
so we can speak to him?

51
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:09,712
Ugh. Fine, but the man
really needs to work on his girl issues.

52
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:11,915
Another reason
to consider a life of piracy.

53
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,833
Even today, I understand
that's an all-male profession.

54
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,315
Okay, she's gone.

55
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,953
Sorry I lost my cool.

56
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,470
So, what's going on?

57
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,868
Okay, here's the deal.

58
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:33,076
Six months ago, my research
testing the predicted composition...

59
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,629
...of trans-Neptunian objects
ran into a dead end.

60
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:36,914
So?

61
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:39,957
My visa's only good as long
as I'm employed at the university.

62
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,998
When they find out I've got squat,
they're gonna cut me off.

63
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:46,196
By the way, when I say "squat,"
I mean "diddlysquat."

64
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,234
lwish I had squat.

65
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:52,752
Wait. What have you been doing
for the past six months?

66
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:54,989
You know, checking e-mail...

67
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:57,070
...updating my Facebook status...

68
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,629
...messing up Wikipedia entries.

69
00:04:01,559 --> 00:04:04,915
Did you know Netflix lets you
stream movies on your computer now?

70
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,630
You've continued to take the university's
money under false pretenses?

71
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,154
Highly unethical for an astrophysicist.

72
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,039
Although, practically mandatory
for a pirate.

73
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:18,359
I don't wanna go back to India.
It's hot and loud.

74
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,909
And there's so many people.

75
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,633
You have no idea. They're everywhere.

76
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:29,070

Oh, beef.

I'm gonna miss you so much.

81
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,913
Did you know at the Mumbai McDonald's,
you can't get a Big Mac?

82
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:00,035
All you can get
is a Chicken Maharaja Mac.

83
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:02,028
And the special sauce?

84
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,670
Curry. Which in India,
believe you me, is really not that special.

85

-Don't worry. You'll find another job.
-Yeah, let me start practicing for it.

with that Maharaja Mac?"

I'm not adept at reading facial cues.

You're either sad or nauseated.

-l'm sad.
-I was going to say sad.

and tomato sauce.

Oh, beefaroni.

I think I'll miss you most of all.

97
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,391
I've always been a little confused
about this. Why don't Hindus eat beef?

98
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,994
-We believe cows are gods.
-Not technically.

99
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,879
In Hinduism,
cattle are thought to be like God.

100
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:54,352
Do not tell me about my culture.
I'll take you out, I swear to cow.

Me too. I'm just-- I'm a little on edge.

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,153
Mm, understandable. Your life seems
to be crumbling around you...

about Hinduism and cows.

for the selection bias?

for the observational efficiency.

-I assumed as much, but never fear.

Raj?

340
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:58,154
I'm busy.

341
00:18:58,319 --> 00:18:59,308
Doing what?

342
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,148
-You've made your point.
-What do you want, Sheldon?

343
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,392
I looked over the board,
and it turns out you were right.

344
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,118
-You were wrong?
-I didn't say that.

345
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:13,157
-That's the only logical inference.
-I didn't say it.

346
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,991
Anyway, I would like you to come back
and work for me.

347
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,952
For you or with you?

348
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,116
In this context,
"for me" could mean "with me."

349
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:25,031
-l have conditions.
-| reject them all.

350
00:19:25,199 --> 00:19:26,871
I'll take the job.

351
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:29,517
See you Monday.

352
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,240
-Wait. You have to drive me home.
-How did you get here?

353
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,833
-I walked.
-So walk home.

354
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,230
I can't. There's a big dog outside.

355
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:44,389
We can start thinking about methods
of optimizing the detector...

356
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,120
-...for 500 GeV particles.
-All right.
