1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,667
All right, Raj has played
his Phantom Warlord card...

2
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:11,469
...and lam going to back him up
with my strangling Vines.

3
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:14,555
Choke on that, sucker.

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,631
Okay. Well, then I'll just cut your vines
with my Ruby Sword.

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,349
That's right, I did it. I cut them.

6
00:00:23,639 --> 00:00:25,311
Um....

7
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:28,031
l have a question.

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,270
Warlord beats troll, troll beats elf,
elf beats water sprite...

9
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:36,228
...and basically everything beats
Enchanted Bunny.

10
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,237
Unless you have the Carrot of Power.

11
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,234
Okay, I've got another question.

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,197
When does this get fun?

13
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,914
Are we gonna talk or are we gonna play
Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah?

14
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,116
Just play a potion card.

15
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,474
Which one?

16
00:00:51,639 --> 00:00:54,551
It doesn't matter,
you can't possibly win.

17
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,035
-Don't ruin the game.
-How could he ruin the game?

18
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,875
Given the cards already played, Penny can
only be holding Necromancer Potions...

19
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,837
...which are only effective against
wraiths and daywalkers...

20
00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:07,150
...and there are no more left.
The cards remaining in the stack are:

21
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,676
Four fire weapons, a troll,
two ogres and the Jewel of Osiris.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,877
See? Ruined.

23
00:01:13,839 --> 00:01:15,636
Sheldon, that is incredible.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,719
From your vantage point,
it certainly must seem so.

25
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,794
Sheldon has kind of
a photographic memory.

26
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,552
"Photographic" is a misnomer.

27
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:26,392
l have an eidetic memory,
as I've told you many times.

28
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,348
Most recently last year during lunch
on the afternoon of May 7th.

29
00:01:31,639 --> 00:01:33,869
You had turkey
and complained it was dry.

30
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:35,631
Well, I guess game's over.

31
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:37,517
Really? Oh, great.

32
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,830
I mean, aww....

33
00:01:41,839 --> 00:01:43,511
-Okay, I gotta go.
-Why?

34
00:01:43,679 --> 00:01:47,911
Because last time I didn't go, I
ended up playing Mystic Warlords of Ka.

35
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,547
Not "Ka." Ka-ah.

36
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,636
-Bye.
-See you.

37
00:01:56,279 --> 00:01:58,270
Still can't believe
she's going out with me.

38
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,918
Nobody can.

39
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:03,708
That reminds me,
I have a bone to pick with you.

40
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,836
-What?
-You and I made a pact...

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,389
...that if either of us
ever got a hot girlfriend...

42
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,516
...that person
would have his girlfriend...

43
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,114
...hook the other guy up
with one of her girlfriends.

44
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:15,076
-Yeah, I don't remember that.
-Wha--?

45
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,356
June 30th, 2004.

46
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,559
Opening day of Spider-Man 2
at the AMC Pasadena.

47
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,269
They only had red ICEES, no blue.

48
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,469
Oh, yeah.

49
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:28,233
Yeah, you've been with Penny
for like a month and a half.

50
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,516
Where's my shorty, Morty?

51
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,035
Howard, you can't hold me to that.

52
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,997
-Why not?
-When I made that agreement...

53
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:39,277
...I didn't think I'd ever have a girlfriend,
and l was positive you never would.

54
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:43,434
-How come I wasn't part of this deal?
-You had left the refreshment stand...

55
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,832
...in order to indulge in your customary
preemptive pre-show urination.

56
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:52,597
So that's how it works? I have a teeny
bladder and I don't get a hot girlfriend?

57
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,593
Yeah, Raj, that's how it works.

58
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:57,956
Damn.

59
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:25,472
Oh, damn it. Can I have a napkin?

60
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,116
I'm sorry, no.

61
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,517
But you have a whole bunch of them.

62
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,911
Yes, I've moved
to a four-napkin system.

63
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:37,389
Lap, hands, face
and personal emergency.

64
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:41,551
If you like, starting tomorrow
I'll add a guest napkin...

65
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:44,870
...but I'm afraid
there's nothing I can do for you today.

66
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,315
Good luck. That's the face napkin.

67
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:55,071
-So have you talked to Penny yet?
-No, I haven't.

68
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,196
-Why not?
-Because I've been busy.

69
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,715
Because I haven't figured out a way
to bring it up.

70
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,109
And mostly,
and I can't stress how key this is...

71
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:04,474
...because I don't want to.

72
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:07,358
A pact is a pact.
You have to get Penny to fix me up.

73
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,714
It's not that simple.
What am I supposed to say?

74
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:13,110
"Penny, you have any friends
you'd like to never hear from again?"

75
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:18,990
Come on. I'm smart, I have a good job.
And I have only 3 percent body fat.

76
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,948
It's true. I've seen him at the beach.
He's like a human chicken wing.

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,353
Leonard, come on.

78
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,557
-Fine, I'll ask if she has a friend for you.
-A hot friend.

79
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,269
-Right.
-And tall.

80
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,989
I want our kids to be able to ride
Space Mountain before they're 20.

81
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,312
I'll see what I can do.

82
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,353
Hey, guess what I heard today.

83
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,869
I'd imagine you heard
any number of things today.

84
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:43,234
When you arrived at work,
you undoubtedly heard:

85
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,594
"Hello. How are you, Raj?"

86
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:47,227
You're wearing a new sweater vest,
you may have heard:

87
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,029
"New sweater vest?" And possibly,
though less likely, "Nice sweater vest."

88
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,875
Why don't I just tell you
what I heard today?

89
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:56,553
That would probably save us
some time.

90
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,717
Saturday night
at the comic-book store...

91
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,792
...they're having a Mystic Warlords
of Ka-ah tournament. First prize is $500.

92
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:05,393
-If we team up, we'd be unstoppable.
-l'm sorry, Raj.

93
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,711
l have no interest in playing a game
in which I find no challenge.

94
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:10,995
-But what about the money?
-l have money.

95
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,673
But this is other money.

96
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,997
How does it differ
from the money I have?

97
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:17,118
Half of it will be mine.

98
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:20,397
Do you need it
to buy a less disturbing sweater vest?

99
00:05:23,359 --> 00:05:24,917
-Leonard, help.
-Are you kidding?

100
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,675
I couldn't even talk him into giving me
one of his freaking napkins.

101
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,512
[SIGHS]

102
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,631
Wow, you really are a genius.

103
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:40,432
Not really. I Googled how to do that.

104
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:45,158
So listen....

105
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,952
Have you ever made a pact
with someone?

106
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,678
You mean like a pinky swear?

107
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,673
Okay, fine. Like a pinky swear.

108
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,795
In the first grade, my friend Rosie and I
made a pact to marry Bert and Ernie.

109
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,152
-You know, from Sesame Street.
-l'm familiar with Bert and Ernie.

110
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,036
Then we found out
we both wanted Ernie.

111
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,667
We didn't speak again
till middle school.

112
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:10,388
Over puppets?

113
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,597
The heart wants what the heart wants,
Leonard.

114
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,272
Okay.

115
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,433
Speaking of what the heart wants, um...

116
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,674
...a long time ago I made a pact
with Wolowitz that kind of involves you.

117
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,034
Okay, I don't know
where you're going with this...

118
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:40,228
...but tread carefully because it may be
the last conversation we ever have.

119
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:42,828
No, no, nothing like that.

120
00:06:42,999 --> 00:06:46,196
No, the deal was that
if either of us ever got a girlfriend...

121
00:06:46,359 --> 00:06:49,237
...we'd have her fix the other one up
with one of her friends.

122
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:52,550
You thought a good time to bring this up
would be right after sex?

123
00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:57,235
Well, I sure as hell wasn't gonna
bring it up before sex.

124
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:02,109
And during l was trying to remember
what I read on Google, so....

125
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,151
I'm not hooking Wolowitz up
with my friends.

126
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,118
Come on,
it doesn't have to be a good friend.

127
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,636
And you know that deep down inside,
Howard's a really nice guy.

128
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:19,429
The problem isn't what's on the inside.
It's the creepy candy coating.

129
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:23,475
Will you at least think about it?

130
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,118
Just as a favor to me?

131
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,469
[SIGHS]

132
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:31,393
The great thing about Ernie
was he never asked me for anything.

133
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:34,393
He just gave.

134
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,838
Got it. Got it. Got it.

135
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:41,036
Got it. Got it. Got it.

136
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:44,157
Betty and Veronica. Oh.

137
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,471
Hey, Sheldon, the new Green Lantern
figurine's coming in tomorrow.

138
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,789
-Want me to set one aside for you?
-Thank you.

139
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:54,156
You just robbed me of the opportunity
to stumble upon the figurine...

140
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,791
...and make the oh-so-satisfying journey
from discovery to desire to possession.

141
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:01,154
-All right, I won't.
-But I must have it.

142
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,595
-Okay, I'll set one aside for you.
-Thank you.

143
00:08:04,119 --> 00:08:07,748
I can buy all these things online.
I come here for the personal service.

144
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:14,189
Stuart, is the Wil Wheaton signed up
for the Mystic Warlords Tournament...

145
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:16,077
...the Wil Wheaton from Star Trek?

146
00:08:16,239 --> 00:08:18,230
Yeah, he lives around here. Big gamer.

147
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:21,277
Excuse me,
are you saying that Wil Wheaton...

148
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,910
...a.k.a. Ensign Wesley Crusher
on Star Trek: The Next Generation...

149
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,956
...is participating in your tournament?

150
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,079
I'm sorry, did I rob you of the opportunity
to stumble onto that for yourself?

151
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,673
No, wait, you don't understand.
Growing up, I idolized Wil Wheaton.

152
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,911
You know, Wesley Crusher
had an eidetic memoryjust like me.

153
00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:41,639
Oh, what a coincidence.
You can discuss that with him...

154
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,869
...while playing in the tournament.
Sign here.

155
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,827
Yeah, I was such a fan that in 1995
I traveled 10 hours by bus...

156
00:08:47,999 --> 00:08:50,388
...to a sci-fi convention
in Jackson, Mississippi...

157
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,869
...wearing my Starfleet Academy
cadet uniform...

158
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:55,599
...in order to meet Wil Wheaton
and get him to autograph...

159
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:58,319
...my mint-in-package
Wesley Crusher action figure.

160
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,635
Oh, it'll be like a reunion then.
Sign here.

161
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,598
Yeah, my arduous journey, however,
was for naught.

162
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:07,273
Although advertised to appear,
he did not show up.

163
00:09:07,439 --> 00:09:10,988
It was at that moment
I vowed eternal hatred for Wil Wheaton.

164
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:14,592
Okay, great,
you can tell him you hate him. Sign here.

165
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:18,035
It might interest you to know
that Wil Wheaton currently ranks sixth...

166
00:09:18,199 --> 00:09:21,635
...on my all-time enemies list, right
between director Joel Schumacher...

167
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,360
...who nearly destroyed
the Batman movie franchise...

168
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:27,113
...and Billy Sparks,
who lived down the street from me...

169
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,509
...and put dog poop
on the handles of my bicycle.

170
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:31,670
Okay, I get it. He's a bad guy.
Sign here.

171
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,991

in the immortal Wrath of Khan:

"He tasks me.
He tasks me and I shall have him."

173
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,357
-No doubt. Sign here.
-"From hell's heart, I stab at thee."

174
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:50,837
All right, Raj.
Looks like you're teamed up with...

175
00:09:50,999 --> 00:09:52,990
..."Die, Wil Wheaton, die."

176
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,840
So tell me more
about the future mother of my children.

177
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,793
She's adorable, Howard.
I think you'll like her.

178
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:07,278
Great.

179
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,154
What did you tell her about me?
Did you mention body fat?

180
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:13,718
No, I thought
that'd be a nice surprise for her.

181
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,757
Good, good.

182
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,270
I told her you're an aerospace engineer,
you speak five languages--

183
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:23,918
Six, if you count Klingon.

184

00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,351
-Right?
-Right.

186
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,396
And I told her you have
an unhealthy attachment to your mother.

187
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,471
-What?
-l'm kidding.

188
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,235

around the moons of Nibia...

199
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,638
...and around the Antares Maelstrom,
and around Perdition's flames.

200
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:20,877
You keep quoting Wrath of Khan,
but he was in Next Generation.

00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:24,395
-lt's a totally different set of characters.
-Silence.

How much longer must I wait
for my revenge?

203

and Stuart win their match...

...and we beat Lonely Larry and
Captain Sweatpants in the next round...

...we'll face off for championship.

206
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:42,193
So my path to satisfaction is blocked
by Lonely Larry and Captain Sweatpants.

207
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,791
Very well, they must be destroyed.

208
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,678
Dude, you have to stop talking like that.
It's really lame.

-What are you studying?
-Microbiology.

213
00:12:04,999 --> 00:12:09,197
Oh, cool. So you could study me.

I don't understand.

215
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:15,594
Microbiology is the study
of tiny living things.

I know, I'm studying it.

217
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:25,316
Yeah, and I said you could study me
because I'm a tiny living thing.

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,836
-lt's a joke.
-Are you sure?

00:12:34,439 --> 00:12:36,395
-Do you like science fiction?
-No.

220
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,516

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,632
-Either.
-No.

229
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:11,267

Did that guy just say, "Revenge is a dish
best served cold," in Klingon?

235
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,550
I believe so.

You like computers?

239
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,680
I use them. I don't like them.

Okay. Puppies.
Where do you stand on puppies?

241
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,519
A puppy once bit my face.

242
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,079
Of course it did.

243
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,188
-How about that? Einstein was wrong.
-What?
