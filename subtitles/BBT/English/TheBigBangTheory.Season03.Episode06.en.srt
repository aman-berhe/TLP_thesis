00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:10,476
Excuse me.
You're misusing the word "ho."

5
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:14,988
It's an interjection used to call attention
to a destination, not an object.

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,630
As in, uh, "Land ho!"

[CHUCKLES]

11
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,874
If you refer to the work of Benjamin
Franklin, he did not discover electricity.

12
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,475
He merely used a kite to determine
that lightning consists of electricity.

13
00:00:36,639 --> 00:00:41,394
He also invented the Franklin stove,
bifocals and the flexible urinary catheter.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,913
-Kites ho.
-We're heading out for some kite fighting.

15
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,638
-Kite fighting?
-Oh, yeah.

16
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,916
It's an extremely competitive,
cutthroat sport.

17
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,591
Well, actually,
the risk of throat-cutting is very low.

18
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,958
On the other hand, severe string burn
is a real and ever-present danger.

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,232
-Uh, you wanna come watch?
-Oh, gee, ha, sounds amazing.

did the sucking lie?

Leonard realized Penny's hiding him
from her friends...

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,912
...because he's a tiny little man
who flies kites.

it was a you-suck look.

Well, her actions could be
out of concern for your feelings.

00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,030
Perhaps she's excluded you
from these gatherings...

66
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,715
...because she's scouting for a new mate
and doesn't wanna do it in front of you.

Oh, how kind of her.

Agreed. Most primates don't show
that sort of discretion.

"How do you do?"

You always do this. Ditch me
for a woman you don't have a shot with.

you could give me my kite back?

77
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,318
I'm sorry, Raj,
but the rules of aerial warfare dictate...

...that the fallen kite go to the victor.
