Wow, Sheldon, I cannot believe
you made up your own game.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,549
Oh. Research Lab is more than a game.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,914
It's like the slogan says:

4
00:00:11,079 --> 00:00:14,992
"The physics is theoretical,
but the fun is real."

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,034
We must not be playing it right.

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,836
All right. Five.
One, two, three, four, five.

Oh. Great roll.

10
00:00:28,999 --> 00:00:31,638
Now you can demolish
your Soviet-style cyclotron...

00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,678
...and build the large hadron collider.

Yay.

you two have quite the edge...

and Koothrappali on Sunday.

Oh, gee, Sheldon,
I don't think we can play on Sunday.

Why not?

18
00:00:49,639 --> 00:00:53,393

that Penny will now tell you. Penny?

from the airport.

She has to pick up her friend Justin.

And I can't play
because I'm going with her. Right?

22

Uh, yeah, if you want.
There may not be room.

23
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:05,832
He's got a lot of stuff, like guitars
and amplifiers.

That's why she can't play on Sunday.

-Who is this Justin?
-Your turn.

-I told you about him.
-Roll the dice.

Yeah. My friend from Omaha,
plays the guitar.

30
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,632
He's coming
looking for session work.

31
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,835
So I told him
he could crash on my couch.

in a nuclear meltdown.

Hang on. Some guy
is gonna be sleeping on your couch?

He's not some guy. He's my friend.

36

So by friend, do you mean
"friend" friend...

37
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,514
...gay friend, or "ex-boyfriend
you're now platonic with...

a long time ago.

But we were never, like, going out.

Okay. Not to be pedantic,
the last I checked...

45
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,308
..."went out" was the past tense
of "going out"...

46
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:05,549

is a popular euphemism...

of their contribution to their fields.

To make this game
even more compelling...

contribution of the man to the field...

166

HOWARD: Okay, sorry.
-Maybe it's different in this country.

167
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,193
Back in India, it means you're upset
with a guy named Howard.

168
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,954
-I said I'm sorry.
-Sorry doesn't make up for the fact...

169
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,475
...I had to make chicken and rice
with this vegan guy.

170

what vegan chicken and rice is? Rice.

peed so much in your life?"

Oh, my God.
You are such a mama's boy.

174
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,996
HOWARD:
Don't bring my mother into this!

175
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,639
You brought your mother into this!

176
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:53,152
Stop it! Both of you!

177
00:08:53,319 --> 00:08:55,913

"I'll tell you what's making Sheldon cry.

185
00:09:18,439 --> 00:09:20,907
Oh, sure. You can tell
when Sheldon's upset.

186
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:30,313
Oh. Thank you very much.
Come back soon.

187
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,588

[SIGHS]

189
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:38,193
Hey, Sheldon.
What're you doing here?

190
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,191
This is a restaurant. It's lunchtime.

191
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,113
I'd think as a waitress you'd be familiar
with the paradigm.

192
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,232
-ls Leonard coming?
-No.

193
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,790
I believe Leonard is waiting for you
to come back to him and apologize.

194
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,234
-Well, that's not gonna happen.
-I assumed that.

195
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,675
-Hence my true purpose in coming here.
-Which is?

196
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,273
I want you to crawl back to him
and apologize.

197
00:09:56,439 --> 00:10:01,513
-l'm busy.
-Excuse me, miss. I'd like to order lunch.

198
00:10:04,999 --> 00:10:07,559
-Fine. What do you want?
-I have a few questions.

199
00:10:07,719 --> 00:10:10,472
First, I notice that you offer
soup and a half sandwich.

200
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:11,833
-Yes.
-Where exactly...

201
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:13,955
...does the half-sandwich come from?

202
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,395
Are you giving me half
of someone else's sandwich?

203
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:20,355
Or do I have to wait for someone else
to order the other half?

204
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:22,510
No. Sheldon, they just make
a half sandwich.

205
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,318
You can't make a half sandwich.

206
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,836
If it's not half of a whole sandwich,
it's just a small sandwich.

207
00:10:27,999 --> 00:10:30,513
Okay, fine.
It's soup and a small sandwich.

208
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,911
-ls that what you want?
-Of course not. I'll have my usual.

209
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,992
-Great.
-Aren't you gonna ask...

210
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,435
-...if I want a beverage?
-Usually lemonade?

211
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,589
-Yes.
-Want lemonade?

212
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:40,828
-Yes.
-Anything else?

213
00:10:40,999 --> 00:10:42,591
Yes. I want you to apologize to Leonard.

214
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:47,235
lam not going to apologize.
I've done nothing. He's overreacting.

Irrelevant.
The disruption in your relationship...

216

...is making my life intolerable.

217

Well, I'm sorry, Sheldon,
but this really isn't about you.

218

I don't follow.

219
00:10:57,719 --> 00:11:00,358
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be right there.
Look, Sheldon, I have to go.

220
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:04,034
All right. Let's assume ad arguendum,
that in this case Leonard is wrong.

221
00:11:04,199 --> 00:11:06,667
-Leonard is wrong.
-Considering the transgressions...

222

...you committed

you could return the favor?

Were you under the impression that
Leonard has no complaints about you?

227
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,678

-Your driving.

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,118
-My singing?
-That's from my list.

234
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,589
Leonard'd be a fool
if he didn't agree with it.

00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:47,796
Okay, if Leonard has problems with me,
why hasn't he just said so?

According to him, you're over-sensitive
and have a temper.

Oh, really? Well, then do me a favor
and tell Leonard that he can drop dead.
