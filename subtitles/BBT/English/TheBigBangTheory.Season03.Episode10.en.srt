Hey, Leonard, check this out.

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,837
Leonard, she's doing it again.

3
00:00:11,399 --> 00:00:14,311
I think it upsets Sheldon
when you play with the food.

4
00:00:14,479 --> 00:00:18,313
No, it upsets Sheldon when she
willy-nilly takes it from the containers...

5
00:00:18,479 --> 00:00:21,152
...without regard
for its equitable distribution.

6
00:00:21,319 --> 00:00:24,231
This is essentially
why you have famine in India.

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,788
You want me to put it back?

8
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,317

-lt upsets Sheldon...

00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,393
What's up, my nerdizzles?

11
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:41,558
Raj, Sheldon, I want you
to meet my girlfriend, Bernadette.

12
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:43,038
-Hello.
-Leonard, Penny.

13
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:45,508
-You know my girlfriend, Bernadette.
-Yeah. Hey.

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,194
Bernadette,
say "fo'shizzle" to my nerdizzles.

15
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,716
I don't think I can.

16
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,640
I don't have Howard's street cred.

17
00:00:54,919 --> 00:00:58,389
I hope it's all right, I told Bernadette
she could join us for dinner.

18
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,438
-Sure. The more, the merrier.
-No, that's a false equivalency.

19
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,919
More does not equal merry.

20
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,072
If there were 2000 people right now,
would we be celebrating?

21
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,753
No, we'd be suffocating.

22
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,439
-Sheldon.
-Don't "Sheldon" me.

23
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,989
-We ordered for five people, not six.
-lt's fine.

24
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,150
We'll put it on the table, family-style.

25
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,914
Oh, sure. Why don't we put our hands
behind our backs...

eating contest?

27
00:01:19,919 --> 00:01:23,036
Relax. It'll be fine. Sit down, you guys.

28

-What?

29
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,552
Oh, yeah, you can't sit there.

30
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:31,914
-Why not?
-That's where Sheldon sits.

31
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,353
He can't sit somewhere else?

32
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:37,712
In the winter, that seat's close enough
to the radiator...

33
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:40,074
...so he's warm
yet not so close that he sweats.

34
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,435
In the summer,
it's in the path of a breeze...

35
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,397
...created by opening windows there.

36
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,836
It faces the television at an angle
that isn't direct so he can talk...

37
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,151
...yet not so wide
that the picture looks distorted.

38
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,278
Perhaps there's hope for you after all.

39
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:26,437
-I love your shoes.
-Oh, thanks. They are cute, aren't they?

40
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:28,237
-Where'd you get them?
-Shoes for Less.

41
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,558
-l've been meaning to go over there.
-Oh, great selection, great prices.

Utero-Americans?

47
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,312
-Just eat your dinner.
-Don't take him too seriously.

48
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,790
A lot of what he says
is intended as humor.

49
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,311
Yeah, well,
I don't think it's very funny.

50
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,790
Me neither,
but he just lights up when I laugh.

51
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,550
Howard, never let her go.

52
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,039
Leonard, Howard says you're working on
fundamental tests...

53
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,397
-...of quantum mechanics.
-I am. Are you interested in physics?

54
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:15,674
I find it fascinating.

lfl hadn't gone into microbiology...

56
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:21,912
...I probably would have gone
into physics or ice dancing.

57
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,393
My tests of the Aharonov-Bohm
quantum interference effect...

58
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:27,277
...have reached an interesting point.

59
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,749
We're testing phase shift
due to electric potential.

60
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,035
-That's amazing.
SHELDON [CHUCKLES]: Yes.

61
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,714

as amazing as third graders...

Are you going to try to set up
the voltages using tunnel junctions?

66
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:52,994
Yes, I am.

67
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:56,310
-Wanna see a simulation on my laptop?
-Oh, yeah. Show me.

68
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,712
In microbiology, the most exciting thing
I get to work with is yeast.

SHELDON: Howard?
-Yeah?

70
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,068
Your shoes are delightful.

can I talk to you for a second?

83
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:54,789
It's not about shoes, is it?

84
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,995
I don't think
I could go through that again.

85
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,674
-lt's not about shoes.
-Then speak.

86
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,071
-Um, actually, can we do it in private?
-All right.

88
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:09,958
I agree, it's rude,
but she asked for privacy.

Thanks, Raj.
Okay, so here's the thing.

90
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,996
l was wondering if you could
maybe teach me a little physics.

91
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,792
-A little physics?
-Yeah.

92
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:24,837
There's no such thing. Physics
encompasses the entire universe.

93
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,275
From quantum particles to supernovas.

94

to spinning galaxies.

98
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:40,357
-Why can't Leonard teach you?
-Because I wanna surprise him.

99
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:42,396
Can't you surprise him
in some other way?

100
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,439
For example, I'm sure he'd be delightfully
taken aback if you clean your apartment.

Come on, Sheldon,
this is important to me.

in school?

The one with the frogs.

00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,438
The interference pattern was cool
when the electron beam was on.

335
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:14,592
I'm glad you enjoyed it. Most people
aren't that interested in what I do.

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,676
Actually, that's not true, Leonard.

338
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:25,911
I've been thinking that, given
the parameters of your experiment...

339
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:29,116
...the transport of electrons
through the nano-fabricated rings...

340
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:33,511
...is no different than the experiment
already conducted in the Netherlands.

341
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,310
Their observed phase shift in
the diffusing electrons inside the ring...

342
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,550
...already demonstrated
electric analogue...

343
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,439
...of the Aharonov-Bohm
quantum interference effect.

344
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:51,949
That's it. That's all I know.

345
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,153
Oh, wait.

00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:58,708
Fig Newtons were named after a town
in Massachusetts, not the scientist.
