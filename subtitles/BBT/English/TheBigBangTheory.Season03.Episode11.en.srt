[SOFT MUSIC PLAYING ON TV]

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,555
Aw, I always tear up when
the Grinch's heart grows three sizes.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,994
Tears seem appropriate.

4
00:00:11,159 --> 00:00:14,196
Enlargement of the heart muscle,
or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy...

5
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:17,749
...is a serious disease, which could lead
to congestive heart failure.

6
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:20,913
Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.

7
00:00:21,599 --> 00:00:24,272
-You really didn't like it, Sheldon?
-No, on the contrary.

8
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:28,910
I found the Grinch to be a relatable,
engaging character.

9
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:32,754
l was really with him up to the point that
he succumbed to social convention...

10
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,992
...and returned the presents
and saved Christmas.

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,755
What a buzzkill that was.

12
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,673
When we watch Frosty the Snowman,
he roots for the sun.

13
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:46,916
Excuse me, but the sun is essential
for all life on Earth.

14
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,312
Frosty is merely a bit of frozen
supernatural ephemera in a stolen hat.

15
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,433
A crime, by the way, for which
he is never brought to account.

16
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,078
Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.

17
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,038
I just love decorating the Christmas tree,
it makes me feel like a little girl again.

18
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:30,275
We didn't have a tree
when l was growing up.

19
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,079
-Really? Why not?
-Mm, in my family...

20
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,915
...holidays weren't so much celebrated,
as studied for their anthropological...

21
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,388
...and psychological implications
on human society.

22
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:42,916
Oh, sounds festive.
Did you at least give presents?

23
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,549
Hm, in a way. We presented papers.

24
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,072
And then broke off into focus groups
and critiqued each other.

25
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,350
Sheldon, what about you?
Did you have a tree?

26
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,829
Oh, yes.

27
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,995
We had a tree, we had a manger...

28
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,072
...we had an inflatable Santa Claus
with plastic reindeer on the front lawn.

29
00:02:03,639 --> 00:02:07,188
To make things more jolly, there were
so many blinking lights on the house...

30
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,430
...they induced
neighborhood-wide seizures.

31
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:12,194
I take it you don't wanna
help us trim the tree?

32
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,111
I do not. But if you insist on decorating
a spider-infested fire hazard in my home...

33
00:02:18,279 --> 00:02:20,588
...I would request
that you that add this.

34
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:21,794
What is it?

35
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,191
You're kidding, right?
It's a bust of Sir Isaac Newton.

36
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,590
Oh, sure, sure.
Yeah, very Christmassy.

37
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:34,912
Excuse me, it's much more Christmassy
than anything you've put on the tree.

38
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:36,910
LEONARD:
Here we go.

39
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,716
December 25th, 1642, Julian calendar,
Sir Isaac Newton is born.

40
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:44,518
Jesus, on the other hand,
was actually born in the summer.

41
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:48,035
His birthday was moved to coincide
with the traditional pagan holiday...

42
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,795
...that celebrated the winter solstice
with lit fires and slaughtered goats.

43
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:53,756
Which, frankly, sounds like more fun...

44
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:57,036
...than 12 hours of church
with my mother followed by a fruitcake.

45
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,788
Merry Newtonmas, everyone.

46
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:03,713
I sense that's not sincere,
although I have no idea why.

47
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:06,757
No, it's fine. Sir Isaac can go
next to this candy cane.

48
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:09,479
No, Isaac goes at the top of the tree.

49
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:12,153
-No, he doesn't.
-I understand.

50
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,993
You dispute Newton's claim
that he invented calculus...

51
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,038
...and you want
to put Gottfried Leibniz on the top.

52
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,509
Yeah, you got me. I'm a Leibniz man.

53
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:24,308
Perhaps when your mother gets here,
she'll talk some sense into you.

54
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,153
-What? Your mother's coming? When?
-Tomorrow.

55
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:29,073
When were you gonna tell me?

56
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,152
Oh. Tomorrow?

57
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,631
Why were you keeping this a secret?

58
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:36,438
-Well, I just-- I thought--
-If I could interject here.

59
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,639
Obviously, Leonard is concerned that his
mother won't approve of you as his mate.

60
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,918
Wh--? Why wouldn't she approve of me?
I'm adorable.

61
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,789
-Yeah, you are. It's just my moth--
-If I could interject again.

62
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,190
Leonard comes from a remarkably
high-achieving family...

63
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,555
...who have all chosen
high-achieving partners.

64
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,553
He probably feels that it's doubtful that
his mother will be overly impressed...

65
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,632
...with his dating a woman
whose most significant achievement...

66
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,354
...is memorizing
the Cheesecake Factory menu.

67
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,398
Hey, it's a big menu.

68
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,791
There's two pages just for desserts.

69
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,757
I know. And those specials,
they change every day.

70
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:16,191
Okay, it's lame when I say it,
it's ridiculous when you pile on.

71
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:18,350
Okay. Sorry.

72
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,954
What did she say
when you told her we were going out?

73
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,394
LEONARD:
Um....

74
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,115
You didn't tell her we were going out,
did you?

75
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,713
LEONARD:
Um....

76
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:29,632
-Why not?
-Um....

77
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,552
Leonard,
I'm no expert on meditation...

78
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,156
...but if you're trying to calm yourself
down, I believe the word is "om."

79
00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:41,432
It was so nice of you
to come to the airport to pick me up.

80
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,998
No trouble at all.

81
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,469
I drove, Mother.

82
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,998
I'm driving now.

83
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,434
Yes, dear. Mommy's proud.

84
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,913
Thank you for your notes on my paper
disproving quantum-brain-dynamic theory.

85
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,109
My pleasure.

86
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,238
You know, for a non-physicist,
you have a remarkable grasp...

87
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,193
...of how electric dipoles
in the brain's water molecules...

88
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,430
...could not possibly form
a Bose condensate.

89
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,674
Wait, wait, wait. When did you
send my mom notes on a paper?

90
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,515
August 16th.
Right after her carpal-tunnel surgery.

91
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,470
-Did I thank you for the flowers?
-You did.

92
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,795
-I don't really like flowers.
-Neither do I.

93
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,077
-But it's the social convention.
-It is, isn't it?

94
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,992
Wait, wait, wait. You had surgery?

95
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,720
-Yes, and Sheldon sent me flowers.
-No, I heard that.

96
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,599
Then what was all that
"wait, wait, wait" about?

97
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,914
I just don't understand why
he knows more about your life than I do.

98
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,675
Because Sheldon and I stay in touch
due to mutual interest and respect...

99
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,355
...while you avoid me
due to unresolved childhood issues.

100
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:44,275
It's what we think caused
your narcissistic-personality disorder.

101
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,119
We discussed it at length
during our last video chat.

102
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,033
Although how we got
onto the subject of you is baffling.

103
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,874
Yes, but we are on the subject,
so I'm obliged to ask.

104
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,314
Leonard, how are you?

105
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:00,952
-Fine, Mom. How are you?
-Menopausal.

106
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,036
Now I'm less fine.

107
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:07,716
-Have you heard your brother's engaged?
-No.

108
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,711
Sheldon, why didn't you tell me?

109
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:13,872
My bad.
I did send a gift from both of us.

110
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,430
She's a remarkable girl. The youngest
appeals-courtjudge in New Jersey...

111
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,477
...and a two-time
Olympic bronze medalist.

112
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:21,873
You must be very happy.

113
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,553
Why? I'm not marrying her.

114
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,958
So how about you?
Are you seeing anyone interesting?

115
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,076
Well, I'm not sure
about interesting, but--

116
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,913
-Not the time, Sheldon.
-Very well.

117
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,471
Shall we switch topics
to Isaac Newton v. Gottfried Leibniz?

118
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:38,913
It's all right, Sheldon.

119
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,197
I will just pretend that Leonard's
not withholding information.

120
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,116
Although, I will point out, Leonard,
that I am a trained psychiatrist...

121
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:49,157
...and you are exhibiting
the same secretive behavioral tics...

122
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:51,554
...that accompanied
your learning to masturbate.

123
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,148
Isn't she brilliant, Leonard?

124
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,880
Howl envy you.

125
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,358
So, Howard, have you and Rajesh
finally summoned the courage...

126
00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:08,432
...to express your latent homosexual
feelings towards one another?

127
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,632
What? No.

128
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:14,988
Why not?

129
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:20,190
Because we don't have latent
homosexual feelings toward one another.

130
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:22,113


131
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:26,992
-No, really. I have a girlfriend now.
-And where is she this evening?

132
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:30,032
She had to go out of town,
her grandmother died.

133
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,068


134
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,352
"Her grandmother died."

135
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:39,388
Honest to God. Ahem.
Leonard, tell her I have a girlfriend.

136
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,391
I don't know
what you're talking about.

137
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,634
What do you mean, you don't know
what I'm talking about?

138
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:47,074
-Tell her I have a girlfriend.
-All right.

139
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:49,311
He "has" a "girlfriend."

140
00:07:50,999 --> 00:07:52,034
Her name is Bernadette.

141
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:55,037
She's a waitress, but going to school
to be a microbiologist.

142
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,634
The more passionately
you stick to this construct...

143
00:07:57,799 --> 00:08:00,188
...the more you're hurting
your partner.

144
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,268
[WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY]

145
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:07,235
Do you really think your lips in my ear
is helping?

146
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:10,194
-Hi. Sorry I'm late.
-Oh, glad you're here.

147
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:12,919
Sit down, I'll get you a plate.
Mom, you remember Penny?

148
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:18,028
Oh, yes, the waitresslactress
with the unresolved father issues.

149
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,113
Has he finally come to terms
with his little slugger growing breasts?

150
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:25,316
Well, he sent me a football
and a catcher's mitt for Christmas...

151
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,277
...so I'm gonna say no.

152
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,157
If it helps,
we're all good with your breasts.

153
00:08:33,319 --> 00:08:34,991
Classic overcompensation.

154
00:08:36,439 --> 00:08:39,875
Oh, speaking of fathers, Leonard,
that reminds me. I'm divorcing yours.

155
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,311
-What?
-Yes. He was cheating on me.

156
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,469
-No.
BEVERLY: Yes.

157
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:46,914
With some waitress
from the university cafeteria.

158
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,356
Can you believe it? A waitress.

159
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:51,868
Oh, no offense, dear.

160
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,155
No, it sounded like a compliment.

161
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:58,834
-When did this happen?
-Well, let's see.

162
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:01,388
Sheldon, when did I
leave Leonard's father?

163
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,754
September 22nd.

164
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,150
Right,
the weekend after Leonard's dog died.

165
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,390
