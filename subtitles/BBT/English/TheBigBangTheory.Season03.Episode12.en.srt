Look at us, getting ready
for a double date with actual women...

00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,117
...who publicly acknowledge
they're our girlfriends.

3
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:13,635
Yes. I mean,
actual women are the best.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,076
I don't understand.
What other kind of women are there?

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:20,755
Artificial women are your department.
You wanna take this?

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,675
No, it would just freak him out.

7
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,348
Listen, before we leave,
I should warn you...

8
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:29,952
...l'm a passionate man...

9
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,350
...and I tend towards
public displays of affection.

10
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,707
What are you
trying to tell me, Howard?

11
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:39,673
There might be making out
in the car or restaurant.

12
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:42,034
I don't want Bernadette
to feel uncomfortable...

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,192
...so it would help
if you and Penny made out too.

14
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,875
Don't worry, we're planning to have sex
right on the salad bar.

Namaste, white people.

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,198
Good news. I've rented us...

-...the four-hour edition of Watchmen.
-Got it.

-Seen it.
-Detailed analysis posted online.

20
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,277
Sorry. Howard and l are going out
with Penny and Bernadette.

21
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,351
Yeah, no more carefree bachelor nights
for me and Leonard.

How did we get actual women?

25
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,314
Great. They get girlfriends
and they just abandon us?

26
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:25,197
It is great, isn't it?

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,797
We have a wonderful evening
ahead of us.

-We do?
-Oh, yes.

29
00:01:29,399 --> 00:01:32,948
I discovered I don't have enough room
on my hard drive for a LINUX partition.

You and l are gonna perform
a full backup, reinitialize...

...and then reinstall
all my operating systems.

-I don't wanna do that.
-All right.

Well, I'm going to perform

Well, what about me?

36

Well, I understand there are
several types of artificial women.

37
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,279
Maybe you should look into that.

38
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,157
Dude, there are so many cool things
we could be doing tonight. Look.

39

At the Glendale Galleria:

Huh? Huh?

00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,910
A salute to zoot.

00:02:37,359 --> 00:02:39,873
-Sounds like a hoot.
-l'm sorry, Raj.

45

to salute any article of clothing tonight...

46
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,590
...much less one that's linked
to race riots in the 1940s.

00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,192

I always thought that was
some sort of after-Christmas sale.

and walk around?

I don't need anything at the galleria.
You need anything at the galleria?

53

No, we would just walk around

00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:10,836
That's a semantically null sentence.

From the university website:

Let's go outside. Outside is good.

If outside is so good...

of years trying to perfect inside?

00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,710

...described in Edwin Abbott's
mathematical fantasy Flatland.

I don't wanna go to Flatland.

77
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:17,396
You're only saying that
because you haven't been there.

I don't recognize your edge.

and I don't want to go alone.

-Chat her up.
-What?

You'd be willing to die
a horrible death...

...on the off chance
you'd get to second base.

97

We're way past second base.

98
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,157

Of course.
I would never make fun of you.
