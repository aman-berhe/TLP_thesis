178
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,434
When Einstein came up
with special relativity...

179
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:12,351
...he was working
at the patent office.

180
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:14,794
So you're gonna go work
at the patent office?

181

Oh, don't be absurd.
That's in Washington.

182
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:20,352

whose streets are laid out...

with a routine task...

186
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,069
...freeing my prefrontal cortex
to work quietly in the background.

187
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,554
A great plan.

188

Why, thank you for noticing.

I'm menial employee of the month.

Do you have a particular field in mind?

205
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:25,512
I do. For thousands of years...

206
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,116
...the lowest classes of the human race
have spent their lives laboring...

207
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,589
...to erect monuments
under the lash of betters.

208
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,349
Until finally they dropped down
and became one with the dust...

209
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,590
...through which they trudged.

210

So how about construction?

216
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,351
Oh, that would be good.

217
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,955
Yeah, sawing, hammering,
eating out of a lunch pail...

218
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,829
...as my working-class fellows and I
sit perched precariously on a girder...

226
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,513
That seems acceptable.

-I don't drive.

What was your last job?

231
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,755
Senior theoretical particle physicist
at CalTech, focusing on M Theory.

232
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,115
Or in layman's terms, string theory.

No, wait. Wait. No, wait.
What are you doing here?

241
00:13:16,719 --> 00:13:18,311
A reasonable question.

242
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,515
I asked myself:

243
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,070
"What is the most mind-numbing,
pedestrian job conceivable?"

244
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,559
Three answers came to mind.

245
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,029
A toll booth attendant,
an Apple store genius...

246
00:13:29,439 --> 00:13:30,792
...and what Penny does.

247
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,953
Now, since I don't like touching
other people's coins...

248
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,750
...and I refuse to contribute
to the devaluation of the word "genius"...

249
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,188
...here I am.

-Just like that?
-Oh, heavens no.

252
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:49,272
Since I don't need to be paid,
I didn't need to be hired.

00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:52,795

and started working for the man.

off a plate.
