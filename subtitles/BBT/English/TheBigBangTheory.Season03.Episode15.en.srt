00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:04,914
Yeah, I miss you too, sweetie. Ha, ha.

2
00:00:05,079 --> 00:00:07,639
Okay, listen, I gotta go,
but I'll see you tonight.

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,676
Bye-bye. Yeah, bye-bye.

4
00:00:09,839 --> 00:00:12,512
No, you hang up first.

5
00:00:13,239 --> 00:00:14,672
Hello?

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,310
Dude, I'm glad
you finally got a girlfriend...

7
00:00:18,479 --> 00:00:21,630
...but do you have to do lovey-dovey
in front of us who don't?

8
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,313
Actually, he might have to.

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,472
There's an economic concept
known as a "positional good"...

10
00:00:26,639 --> 00:00:30,678
...in which an object is only valued
because it's not possessed by others.

11
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:34,149
The term was coined in 1976
by economist Fred Hirsch...

12
00:00:34,319 --> 00:00:38,198
...to replace the more colloquial
but less precise "neener-neener."

13
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,511
That's not true. My happiness
is not dependent on my best friend...

14
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:43,795
-...being miserable and alone.
-Thank you.

15
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,871
I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a perk.

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,872
-Who's miserable and alone?
-Me.

17
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,270
Oh. I used to be like that.
Then I got a girlfriend.

18
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,955
In pre-1976 terms, "neener-neener."

19
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,908
What are you and Bernadette doing
for Valentine's Day?

20
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,755
Yeah, I'm pulling out all the stops.
There's a 39.95 Lover's Special...

21
00:01:03,919 --> 00:01:05,238
...at P.F. Chang's.

22
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,390
Yeah, egg rolls, dumplings,
bottomless wok.

23
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,269
Yeah, and you get your picture taken
on the big marble horse out front.

24
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:13,918
Given that Saint Valentine...

25
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:17,515
...was a third century Roman priest
who was stoned and beheaded...

26
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,830
...wouldn't a more appropriate
celebration...

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,356
...be taking one's steady gal
to witness a brutal murder?

28
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,635
I understand your point,
but given the choice...

29
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,869
...Jews always go with Chinese food.

30
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,198
If anyone's interested,
I'll be spending this Valentine's Day...

31
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,316
...the same way
I spend every Valentine's.

32
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:38,710
Buying rotisserie chicken,
taking it home, standing over the sink...

33
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:42,588
...and eating it out of the package
with my bare hands like an animal.

34
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:46,397
Okay, so to sum up,
one giant marble horse...

35
00:01:46,559 --> 00:01:50,347
...one asinine comment,
one lonely man and his chicken...

36
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:52,111
...and let's see. Who's left?

37
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,033
Oh, that's right, my plans.

38
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:59,472
Isn't anyone gonna ask?

39
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,837
-You're gonna have sex with Penny.
-That's not what I was gonna tell you.

40
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,434
It's okay. I don't mind hearing
about your sex life.

41
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,352
It's his that bugs me.

42
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,909
Guess who the university
is sending to Switzerland...

43
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,039
...to attend a conference and see the
CERN Super Collider on February 14th?

44
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,838
Professor Norton. God knows why.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,390
He hasn't published anything of note
since he won that Nobel Prize.

46
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:24,437
Professor Norton can't make it.
He threw his back out climbing.

47
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,194
I heard he threw his back out
climbing on his girlfriend.

48
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:29,554
-Weather girl on Channel 2?
-That's the one.

49
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,030
In any case,
they're asking me to fill in for him.

50
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,794
In Switzerland
or with the big-boobed weather girl?

51
00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:39,431
Switzerland.
And I get to bring a guest.

52
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,637
RAJESH: Oh, no way, dude!
-Oh, my God, this is incredible.

53
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:45,711
I'm so happy I'm not gonna question
theirjudgment in picking you.

54
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,319
I'm just gonna run home
and start packing.

55
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,796
Wait, why wouldn't you take Penny?

56
00:02:54,999 --> 00:02:57,308
I am taking Penny.

57
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,232
Oh.

58
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,517
Then I anticipate an awkward situation
when you get home.

00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:33,792

-Of course, my good friend. Come in.

00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,152
Yeah, help me out.

62

Which ski hat says,
"Apres Super Collider"?

63
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,076
Sheldon,
I'm not taking you to Switzerland.

64
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,834
Well, of course you are.
Who else would you take?

65
00:03:47,279 --> 00:03:49,747
-Penny.
-What? That's absurd.

66
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,195
Penny has no interest
in subatomic particle research.

67
00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:55,948
Yes, but it'll be Valentine's Day.

68
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,079
We can go sightseeing and skiing
and make love in front of a roaring fire...

69
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,833
...in the shadow
of the snow-capped Alps.

70
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,472
But Penny has no interest
in subatomic particle research.

71
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:09,632
I'm sorry, Sheldon.

72
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,509
Sorry? I've been dreaming about
going to the Large Hadron Collider...

73
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:15,158
...since I was 9 years old.

74
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,757
I've been dreaming about spending
Valentine's with a girl since I was 6.

75
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,116
Shame on you.

76
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,514
That's no dream for a scientist.

77
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,190
-Okay, what's the big surprise?
-Just a minute.

78
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:33,074
This tray contains clues...

79
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:36,993
...as to what you and l are going
to be doing on Valentine's Day.

80
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,993
Oh, wow, okay. Let's see.

81
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,393
We've got milk chocolate,
Swiss cheese, fondue.

82
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,879
My lactose-intolerant boyfriend
is gonna eat all this...

and rocket to the moon?

85
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,996
But it does involve air travel.

86
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,913
Okay. Um....

87
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:10,076
Let me slice this Swiss cheese
with my Swiss Army knife...

88
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,231
...and then you can wash it down...

89
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:16,233
...with a cup
of Swiss Miss instant cocoa.

90
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,233
Okay, I'm starting to think
"Swiss" is key here.

Uh-huh.

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,752
We're going to Disneyland
and ride the Matterhorn.

93
00:05:26,799 --> 00:05:28,391
How does that involve air travel?

94
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,912
We're going to Disney World
and ride the Matterhorn.

95
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,911
-No.
-Okay, sweetie, this started out fun...

...but I'm over it.

We're going to Switzerland
to see the CERN Super Collider.

98
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,838
And ski. We'll also go skiing.

99
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,279
-We're going skiing in Switzerland?
-You'll ski, I'll fall.

100
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,228
But, yeah, we will be in Switzerland
for Valentine's Day.

105

Raabeliechtli, it means turnip light...

00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:09,477
...and refers to a lantern
hand-carved from a root vegetable...

107
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:12,676
...to celebrate Swiss festivals
which you'll not be celebrating...

108
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:15,751
...because, A,
these festivals occur in the fall...

109
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,711
...and B,
you will not be going to Switzerland.

-Oh, not the roommate agreement.
-lndeed, the roommate agreement.

113
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:31,439
I call your attention
to the Friendship Rider...

114
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,954
...in Appendix C: Future Commitments.
Number 37:

115
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:38,112
"In the event one friend is ever invited
to visit the Large Hadron Collider...

116
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,034
...now under construction, he shall invite
the other friend to accompany him."

117
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,553
Oh, for God's sakes.

118
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,438
You actually put that
in an agreement?

119
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:49,397
We put in what happens
if one of us wins a MacArthur Grant...

120
00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:53,950
...or if one of us gets superpowers,
or if one of us is bitten by a zombie.

He can't kill me. Even if I turn.

Is there anything about
if one of you gets a girlfriend?

123
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,075
No, that seemed a little far-fetched.

124
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,634
Sheldon, do you really expect
to enforce this?

125
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,267
I've lived up to my commitments
under the agreement.

126
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,069
At least once a day I ask how you are,
even though I simply don't care.

I no longer stage spontaneous
biohazard drills after 10 pm.

to master Tuvan throat singing.

to hang himself after what he did.
