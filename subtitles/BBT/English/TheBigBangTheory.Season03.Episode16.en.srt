Good morning, Your Honor.

Dr. Sheldon Cooper appearing in pro se.
That is to say, representing himself.

I know what it means.
I went to law school.

169

And yet you wound up in traffic court.

170
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,836
If it would please the court, I'd like
to begin with an opening statement.

171
00:10:19,999 --> 00:10:21,910
The court would advise you
to make it quick.

The court had a dicey-looking breakfast
burrito and just took an lmodium.

I will demonstrate that
l was improperly instructed in driving...

176
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,269
...by a woman whose lack of respect
for society borders on the sociopathic.

177
00:10:43,439 --> 00:10:46,192
I will argue that the emergency
met the legal doctrine...

178
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,598
...of quod est necessarium est Iicitum,
that which is necessary is legal.

179
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:53,796
But first,
I will raise a Sixth Amendment issue.

a non-human entity, to wit, a camera.

I object.
You're completely ignoring the law.

No, I'm following the law.
I'm ignoring you.

over the kiddie table of yours.

00:11:25,999 --> 00:11:29,196
Dr. Cooper, before I find you
in contempt and throw you in jail...

191
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,557
...l'm gonna give you a chance
to apologize for that last remark.

I never apologize for the truth.
