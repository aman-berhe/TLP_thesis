Um.... I don't know, maybe.

I recently had a dream
that l was a giant.

But everything around me
was to scale so it all looked normal.

Really, Leonard?

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,588
You just going to try to recycle Adler's
doctrine of the inferiority complex?

I could probably get that
from the woman at Ralph's.

Where are my pants?

339
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,359
You might wanna check YouTube.

340
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,156
-What do I search?
-lt's already loaded. Just hit play.

341
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,958
All right, people,
let's get down to the math.

342
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,193
It is only three-dimensional thinking
that limits our imagination.

343
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,635
Can I take my pants off
over my head?

344
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,710
Of course not,
my body's in the way.

345
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:39,238
But if we had access
to higher dimensions...

346
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,790
...we could move our pants
around our bodies...

347
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:45,996
...through the fourth dimension...

348
00:19:46,439 --> 00:19:49,875
...and our days of dropping trousers
would be over.

349
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:57,437
Oh, Lord, this couldn't be
any more humiliating.

350
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,477
Oh. Give it a minute.

351
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,551
Now for the astronomers
in the audience...

352
00:20:01,719 --> 00:20:03,914
...get ready to see the dark side
of the moon.

353
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,874
And here's Uranus.

354
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:36,030
