told me this is what I was training for...

Hey, Leonard,
where do you come down on giant ants?

30
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:06,997
Sheldon says impossible,
Howard and I say not only possible...

31
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:10,515
...but as a mode of transportation,
way cooler than the Batmobile.

32
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,276
You are ignoring the square-cube law.

33
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,636
The giant ant would be crushed
under the weight of its exoskeleton.

34
00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:20,155
For the record, the appropriate ranking
of cool modes of transportation...

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,075
...is jetpack, hover board, transporter,
Batmobile and then giant ant.

36
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,993
Seriously, you have nothing better
to do than sit around...

37
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,476
...and discuss the possibility
of giant ants?

38
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,794
-What's with him?
-Perhaps he's at a sensitive point...

39
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:37,438
...in his monthly cycle.

40
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,189
Are you saying he's man-struating?

41
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,196
Not literally.

42
00:02:46,359 --> 00:02:48,315
But as far back as the 17th century...

43
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,790
...scientists observed a 33-day
fluctuation in men's hormone levels.

They always look like they're about
to say something, but they never do.

51
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:19,671
Rabbits do have a respiratory system
that would support great size.

52
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,229
On a side note,
they are one of the few mammals...

53
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,233
...whose scrotum
is in front of the penis.

what they wanna talk about.

about unusual animal genitals...

Can we please talk
about something else?

to life as we know it on this planet?

-Yeah. Think we're getting close.

-l'm not sure.
-How can you not be sure?

-This isn't the place to have this.
-No.

"I love you"...

-Don't push it, Leonard.
-I am not pushing anything.

when I'm ready to say "I love you."

Ah. The premature "I love you."

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,873

00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:37,677
Um....

172
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:38,988
Ack.

173
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,957
And if you were a cat,
I would have brought you a lasagna.

174
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:47,470
Did Leonard send you over here?

175
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:50,995
No. We haven't spoken
since your abrupt departure last night...

176
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:54,595
...caused us to forfeit to Stuart
and his dastardly ringer, Wil Wheaton.

177
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,634
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

178
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:59,950
Not too proud to admit
that I cried myself to sleep.

179
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:02,477
-Again, I'm sorry.
-Let me tell you...

180
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:04,072
...sleep did not come easily...

181
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,915
...with Leonard in the next room
singing along with Alanis Morissette.

182
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,028
-You're kidding.
-No.

183
00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:13,508
Clearly another woman
in dire need of ice cream.

184
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:17,719
What part of this is supposed
to make me feel better?

185
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:20,916
The part where I tell you
I've engineered a rematch...

186
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:22,751
...with Stuart's team for tonight.

187
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,515
Oh, honey, I don't know. Things
are a little weird with Leonard right now.

188
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,269
You want me to remove him from
the team? I'm the captain, I can do that.

189
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:35,314
No, no, that's okay. Just let me
talk to him and I'll get back to you.

190
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,148
-When are you going to talk to him?
-I don't know.

191
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,232
He's in the laundry room now.
Now would be a good time.

192
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,391
You're not gonna leave me
until I do it?

193
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,438
Oh, I think we both know
the answer to that question.

194
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,269
-I think we should talk now.
-What? No, it's okay.

195
00:11:58,439 --> 00:12:01,192
We don't have to talk because
there's nothing to talk about.

196
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,635
-Everything's good.
-Really?

197
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,074
So you didn't get snarky...

198
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,198
...because I said something nice
to a bowl of chili fries?

199
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:11,594
All right, maybe I overreacted.

200
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:14,512
So we're in two different places
emotionally. So what?

201
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:17,438
And maybe I'm a little ahead of you,
and that's fine.

202
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,830
In fact, it makes sense,
because let's face it...

203
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:22,752
...l've been in this relationship
two years longer than you.

204
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,078
Look, Leonard, you have to know
how much I care about you.

205
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,038
It's just that I've said the L word
too soon before...

206
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,872
...and it didn't work out very well.

207
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,959
Really?
I wouldn't know what that's like.

208
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,749
I'm sorry.

209
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,070
-You know what I'm talking about.
-Yeah, I do.

210
00:12:41,439 --> 00:12:44,272
-So we're good?
-Yes, that's what I'm telling you.

211
00:12:44,439 --> 00:12:46,077
We are good. We are great.

212
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,391
All right. Fence mended,
problem swept under the rug.

213
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,959
Time to bowl.

214
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:54,989
Yes, I was eavesdropping.
There's a lot at stake.

215
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,718
Attention, all bowlers,

216
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:03,508
I've taken the liberty
of having these made for our rematch.

217
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,748
-The Wesley Crushers?
-No, not the Wesley Crushers.

218
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,036
The Wesley "Crushers."

219
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,436
-I don't get it.
-Wesley Crusher...

220
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,750
...was Wil Wheaton's character
on Star Trek.

221
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,352
Still don't get it.

222
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:18,475
It's a blindingly clever play on words.

223
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,437
By appropriating his character's
name and adding the S...

224
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,434
...we imply that we will be
the crushers of Wesley.

225
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:28,636
I'm sorry, but the Wesley Crushers...

226
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,030
...sounds like people
who like Wesley Crusher.

227
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,156
No, again,
it's not the Wesley Crushers.

228
00:13:33,319 --> 00:13:35,435
It's the Wesley Crushers.

229
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,073
No, if you want it to mean
you're crushing Wesley...

230
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,151
...it'd be the "Wesley" Crushers.

231
00:13:42,319 --> 00:13:45,277
Do you people even hear yourselves?
It's not Wesley Crushers.

232
00:13:45,439 --> 00:13:49,318
It's not the "Wesley" Crushers,
it's Wesley "Crushers."

233
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,948
Hey, look.
They named their team after me.

234
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,999
No, it's not-- Never mind.

235
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,517
So we're all clear on the bet
and the stakes?

236
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,715
Oh, yes.

237
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:06,918
The losers will be publicly humiliated
in a fashion to be chosen by the victor.

238
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,629
FYI, I plan on having you
publish a scientific paper...

239
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,917
...expounding the discredited
Belakovsky hypotheses.

240
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:17,118
Ouch again.

241
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,872
Hey, Sheldon.

242
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,437
I wanted you to know I'm looking
forward to wiping the floor with you.

243
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,479
Oh, yes? Well, before I respond,
let me ask you a question.

244
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,392
Is your mother a good or poor bowler?

245
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,154
-After you.
-No, after you.

246
00:14:41,319 --> 00:14:45,551
As we are currently crushing you,
Wesley.

247
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,831
It's customary for the player
on the right-hand lane to bowl first.

248
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:54,358
All right.

249
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,718
It's a custom, not a rule.

250
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:06,949
I so loathe you.

251
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,992
That's right, Sheldon.
Embrace the dark side.

252
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,552
That's not even from your franchise.

253
00:15:17,719 --> 00:15:21,428
l-- I want you to know that
even though we're on opposite sides...

254
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,114
...I bear you no ill will.

255
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,800
-Thank you, Stuart. It's nice to know.
-Mm-hm.

256
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,838
People from opposite sides
often have good relationships.

257
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:32,512
You know, Romeo and Juliet...

258
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:35,876
...Tony and Maria
from West Side Story.

259
00:15:36,439 --> 00:15:39,476
What's-his-name and the big, blue chick
in Avatar.

260
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:43,790
I'm gonna bowl now.

261
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,553
Be the ball, Howard.

262
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:49,870
Leave me alone, Sheldon.

263
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,513
You weren't the ball.

264
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,993
Hey, thanks.

265
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,832
-This is fun, huh?
-Yeah.

266
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:07,796
It's good we got out
and did something physical.

267
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:10,314
-Mm-hm.
-Gets us out of our heads.

268
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,469
You get in your head...

269
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:14,517
...you start to over-think, over-analyze,
obsess, you worry.

270
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:17,989
That's not what we're doing tonight.
We're throwing a ball at some pins.

271
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:19,353
-Yeah, that's right.
-Mm-hm.

272
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,477
And someday, we don't know when,
maybe you'll love me back.

273
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,958
Ooh. I'm up.

Sheldon. Sheldon. Sheldon.

275
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,275
Excuse me.

276
00:16:33,439 --> 00:16:37,227
I don't know who you're chanting for,
as I am currently the ball.

277
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:45,117
The ball. The ball. The ball.

278
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:48,914
Thank you, Jesus!

279
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:52,867
As my mother would say.

280
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,754
I'm glad you patched things up
with your boyfriend.

281
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,717
Yeah, me too.

282
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:05,791
It's tough when the L bomb
gets dropped and you're not ready.

283
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,234
Tell me about it.

284
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,752
l dated this one girl,
and I told her that I loved her...

285
00:17:12,159 --> 00:17:14,036
...and she said she wasn't sure.

286
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:17,990
And she strung me along
for almost two years. It was brutal.

287
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,119
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-Thanks.

288
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,909
lwish she had just broken up with me
right there.

289
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,272
Put me out of my misery.

290
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:28,509
-Really?
-Yeah. Would have been kinder.

291
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:31,149
-Wil, you're up.
-Oh, that's me.

292
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,271
Did you let Wil Wheaton
get in your head?

293
00:17:38,439 --> 00:17:40,509
-What are you talking about?
-He's evil.

294
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:42,556
He plays evil mind games.

295
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,995
-Did he tell you his grandmother died?
-No.

296
00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:48,947
If he does, don't believe it. He's not
above playing the dead meemaw card.

297
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:53,634
Yes!

-Yeah. I got it.

00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,108
-Oh, we really need a strike here.
-I know.

00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:15,191
-Take your time and concentrate.
-Leonard, stop pressuring me.

305
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,590
-l'm not pressuring you.
-You are. Just back off.

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,277
Okay. I'm sorry. I'll shut up.

307

I didn't mean shut up.

If she leaves, it's over.

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,629
