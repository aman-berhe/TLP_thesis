I'm not hungry.

341
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,312
ELIZABETH:
Don't send him away. Let him in.

342
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,075
-Who is that?
-I bought a parrot.

343
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,076
Yeah, right.

344
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,956
-Dr. Plimpton?
-Hi.

345
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,269
-Howard, right?
-Uh, yeah.

346
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,391
Can I ask you a question, Howard?

347
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:15,277
Do you like role-playing games?

348
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,952
Yeah, sure. Heh.

349
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,554
In fact, I'm a dungeon master.

350
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,235
Not tonight.

351
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,790
Tonight, you are a deliveryman.

352
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,156
You've brought soup but, uh-oh, Raj and I
don't have enough money to pay you.

353
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:33,152
So we'll have to come
to some other kind of arrangement.

354
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,398
Beg pardon?

355
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,797
You figure out the details.
I'm gonna change into something...

356
00:17:42,959 --> 00:17:45,473
...I don't mind getting ripped off
my milky flesh.

357
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,716
What the frak?

358
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,269
Go away.

359
00:17:51,439 --> 00:17:53,873
She wants New Delhi, not kosher deli.

360
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,072
Besides, you have a girlfriend.

361
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,679
We broke up weeks ago.

362
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,838
-Why didn't you say anything?
-I was waiting for the right time.

363
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,194
This is the right time.

364
00:18:03,719 --> 00:18:05,072
Hey, who's ready for "Halo"?

365
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,310
Oh, this is like a nightmare. Get lost.

366
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,796
The numbers
are shaky enough as it is.

367
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,274
I don't understand.

368
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:14,956
Oh, good. Leonard's here.

369
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:16,638
Good?

370
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,918
Elizabeth? What's going on?

371
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,078
What's going on is you and Howard
are my moving men.

372
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,593
And Raj is my new landlord.

373
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,228
And I don't have enough money
to pay any of you.

374
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:31,752
Is she suggesting
what I think she's suggesting?

375
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,036
Yup. Welcome to
the Penthouse Forum.

376
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,869
Okay, show of hands.
Who's up for this?

377
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,471
We'll all be naked
in front of each other.

378
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,834
I'm out.

379
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:45,230
Everybody ready?

380
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,519
Follow my lead. Almost.

381
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,031
We're going to go out into the hallway
and make a dramatic entrance.

382
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,629
Oh, good. It's so much better
when everyone commits.

383
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:56,750
Run, run, run. Don't look back.

384
00:18:56,919 --> 00:18:59,638
I thought we had something special.

385
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,671
So you say you can't pay your rent?

386
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,399
-Oh, Leonard?
-Hey.

387
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:16,873
I found these in the dryer.

388
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,870
I'm assuming they belong to Sheldon.

389
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,111
Thanks. It's really hard
to find these in his size.

390
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:25,828
So listen.

391
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,594
I've been meaning to talk to you
about the other morning.

392
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,149
PENNY:
You mean you and Dr. Slutbunny?

393
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:33,356
Yeah, I wanted to explain.

394
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,431
No. You don't owe me an explanation.

395
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,636
-I don't?
-No, you don't.

396
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:39,278
So you're notjudging me?

397
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:41,350
PENNY: Oh, I'm judging you
nine ways to Sunday...

398
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,829
...but you don't owe me
an explanation.

399
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,795
Nevertheless, I'd like to get one
on the record...

400
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,554
...so you can understand
why I did what I did.

401
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,676
I'm listening.

402
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,877
She let me.

403
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,991
