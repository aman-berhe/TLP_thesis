It's two degrees, Sheldon.

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,470
I just wanna turn up
the thermostat two degrees.

00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,313
SHELDON: Let me point out
that two degrees can be the difference...

00:00:15,479 --> 00:00:16,548
...between water and steam.

LEONARD:
Yes, if we were lived in a tea kettle.

agreed to in the roommate agreement.

You can try, but the people
across the hall are being very noisy.

You heard that, huh?

20
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,313
Apparently, the one fella
tried to adjust the thermostat...

went bat-crap crazy.

who chooses to live with him.

he was worse when I met him.

Oh, I do not believe that.

-Yeah.

-Run fast, run far.

That should've been my first clue.

tried to warn you off?

00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,631
For all I knew, he was the crazy one.

00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,718
He had this really deranged look.

37
00:02:15,359 --> 00:02:17,748
Well, yeah,
he'd been living with Sheldon.

38
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:20,630
Sure, it makes sense now.

00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,872

and knocked on the door.

-You said you're a scientist.
