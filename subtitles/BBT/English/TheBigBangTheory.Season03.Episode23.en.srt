-I know.

-She dumped you?
-She didn't dump me.

30
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,429
We were just in different places
in the relationship.

31
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,158
I fail to see how a relationship...

We're up on the roof

I'm sorry, what?

42
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,392

parabolic reflector and everything.

-I thought you might wanna see it.
-That makes no sense.

How can you bounce stuff off the moon?
There's no gravity.

ZACK: Hey.

-Hello.
-Whoa, is that the laser? It's bitchen.

63
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,429
Yes. In 1917...

64
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:48,035
...when Albert Einstein established
the theoretic foundation for the laser...

65
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,430
...in his paper
Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung...

66
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:54,956
...his fondest hope was that
the resultant device be "bitchen."

67
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,439
Well, mission accomplished.

68
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:01,997
Let me explain what we're doing here.

69
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,434
In 1969, the astronauts on Apollo 11...

70
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,318
...positioned reflectors on the moon.

71
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,436
We're gonna shoot a laser
off one of them...

72
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:11,159
...and let the light bounce back
into this photomultiplier.

73
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,833
Oh, that's very cool.

74
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:16,753
One question: How can you be sure
it won't blow up?

75
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,316
-The laser?
-The moon.

76
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:24,275
See, now this is a man for Penny.

77
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,758
-That's a great question, Zack.
-No, it's not.

78
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,117
-Sheldon, play nice.
-lt's not a great question.

79
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,352
How could somebody possibly think
we're going to blow up the moon?

80
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,389
That's a great question.

81

Don't worry about the moon.
We set our laser to stun.

82
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,873
Smart.

83
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:47,518
We'll see the beam when it leaves.

84
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,750
It won't be strong enough
when it comes back...

85
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,514
-...to be seen by the naked eye.
-Naked. Heh, heh, heh.

86
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,150
Right, funny.

87
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,836
So that device there
will measure the photons that return...

88
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,037
...and show it to us on this computer.

return. That's the moon. We hit the moon.

That's your big experiment?
All that for a line on the screen?

95
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,798
Yeah, but think
about what this represents.

96
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,157
The fact that we can do this
is the only way of definitively proving...

97
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:44,469
...that there are man-made objects
on the moon...

98
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,995
...put there by a species
that only 60 years before...

99
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,071
...had just invented the airplane.

...the only way to feel better
about Penny going out with other guys...

107
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,477
...is for you to get back on the whores.

108
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,755
-Horse.
-What?

109
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:24,912
The phrase is "get back on the horse."
Not whores.

110

Good morning, Leonard.

an explanation of human behavior?

177
