279
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,151

My mother's
always wanted a grandchild.

337
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,518
Really? Your deeply religious,
born-again Christian mother...

338
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,876
...wants a test-tube grandbaby
born out of wedlock?

339
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,477
Curses.

340
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,918
If I'd thought of that in the first place,
lcould've saved myself this whole night.

341
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,153
Well, it's not that late. You could
still go out and look for number 32.

342
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:57,909
Good night.

343
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,911
Hey, Howard. What's up?

344
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:03,628
-l've decided not to procreate.
-Yeah, yeah, great.

345
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:08,633
Howard, uh, slow down.
What do you mean, "It happened again"?

346
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,790
