00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,953
All right.
I'm ready for my next question.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,313
In a world where rhinoceroses
are domesticated pets...

3
00:00:09,479 --> 00:00:11,197
...who wins the Second World War?

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,437
-Uganda.
-Defend.

5
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:19,557
Kenya rises to power
on the export of rhinoceroses.

6
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:23,598
A central African power block is formed
colonizing North Africa and Europe.

7
00:00:23,759 --> 00:00:26,910
When war breaks out,
no one can afford the luxury of a rhino.

8
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,230
Kenya withers, Uganda triumphs.

9
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,518
Correct. My turn.

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,479
In a world where a piano is a weapon,
not a musical instrument...

11
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:43,075
...on what does Scott Joplin
play the "Maple Leaf Rag."

12
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,800
-Tuned bayonets.
-Defend.

13
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:49,996
-lsn't it obvious?
-You're right, my apologies.

14
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,034
What the hell are you guys playing?

15
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,396
It's a game we invented.
It's called Counterfactuals.

16
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,836
We postulate an alternate world
that differs from ours in one aspect...

17
00:01:01,999 --> 00:01:06,595
-...then pose questions to each other.
-lt's fun for ages 8 to 80. Join us.

18
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:10,511
All right. I like a good brainteaser.
I'll give it a whirl.

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,352
You're in luck. This is an easy one.

20
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:17,639
In a world where mankind is ruled
by a giant intelligent beaver...

21
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:20,313
...what food is no longer consumed.

22
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,393
Uh....

23
00:01:22,559 --> 00:01:26,029

I don't know.

24
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,714
Leonard, be serious.
We're playing a game here.

25
00:01:30,279 --> 00:01:31,837
Ahem, I can figure this out. Let's see.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,989
Um....

27
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,354
Well, beavers eat tree bark.

28
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,478
The only tree bark I know
that humans consume is cinnamon.

29
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,710
-So I'll say cinnamon.
-lncorrect.

30
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,190
Obviously, the answer is cheese Danish.

31
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,311
-What?
-In a world ruled by a giant beaver...

32
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,437
...mankind builds many dams
to please the beaver overlord.

33
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,797
The low-lying city of Copenhagen
is flooded, thousands die...

34
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,839
...devastated, the Danes never invent
their namesake pastry.

35
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,875
How does one miss that?

36
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,553
This is ridiculous.
You're just making stuff up.

37
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:09,797

38
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,670
Oh, yes. You should have been here
for the great Jenga tantrum of 2008.

39

You bumped the table
and you know it.

40
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,389
Perhaps it would be kinder to play
a game more suited to his abilities.

41

We'll close our eyes and count to ten
while you hide.

42

I'm going to my room.

43
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,789
Very good, Leonard. But next time,
don't tell us where you're hiding.

44
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,392
See the paper in The American
Physics Journal on supersolids?

45
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:08,754

I printed out a PDF to read on the potty.

48

00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,356
-lt's a potty. What do you call it?
-Toilet.

50

169
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,073
-That's very offensive.
-Yeah, we all thought so.

170
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,237
LEONARD: Oh, no.
-What?

171
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,391
John and Yoko.

172
00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:42,196
More like Yoko and Yoko.

173
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,509
-Greetings.
LEONARD: Hey.

174
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,150
I brought Amy here
to show her some of the work I'm doing.

175
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:50,231
It's very impressive.
For theoretical work.

176
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,390
Do I detect a hint of condescension?

177
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,232
I'm sorry, was I being too subtle?

178
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,357
I meant compared to the real-world
applications of neurobiology...

179
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,829
...theoretical physics is-- What's
the word I'm looking for? Hmm, cute.

180
00:10:02,999 --> 00:10:04,751
ALL:
Oh.

181
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,277
Are you suggesting the work
of a neurobiologist like Babinski...

182
00:10:09,439 --> 00:10:12,033
...could ever rise to the significance
of a physicist...

183
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,708
...like Clerk Maxwell or Dirac?

184
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:16,312
I'm stating it outright.

185
00:10:16,479 --> 00:10:20,870
Babinski eats Dirac for breakfast
and defecates Clerk Maxwell.

186
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:24,717
You take that back.

187
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:29,435
Absolutely not. My colleagues and |
map the neurological substrates...

188
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,830
...that subserve
global information processing...

189
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:35,548
...which is required for cognitive
reasoning, including scientific inquiry...

190
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:38,717
...making my research, ipso facto,
prior in the ordo cognoscendi.

191
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:43,028
That means it's better than his research,
and by extension, of course, yours.

192
00:10:46,439 --> 00:10:48,430
I'm sorry, I'm still trying to work...

193
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,717
...on the "defecating
Clerk Maxwell." So....

194
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,240
Excuse me, but a grand unified theory,
insofar as it explains everything...

195
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,709
...will, ipso facto,
explain neurobiology.

196
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:05,155
But if successful, I will map
and reproduce your thought processes...

197
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:07,196
...in deriving a grand unified theory.

198
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,193
And therefore, subsume your
conclusions under my paradigm.

199
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,113
That's the rankest psychologism...

200
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,349
...and was conclusively revealed
as hogwash...

201
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,987
...by Gottlob Frege
in the 1890s.

202
00:11:19,319 --> 00:11:22,755
-We appear to have reached an impasse.
-I agree.

203
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,957
I move our relationship

00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,070
-Seconded.
-There being no objections?

No. Uh-uh.

-Good day, Amy Farrah Fowler.
-Good day, Sheldon Cooper.

Can't live with them, can't successfully
refute their hypotheses.

210

Amen to that.

-Hey, Sheldon.
-Hello.

212
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,953
I hear you broke up with Amy.

213
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,759
A breakup would imply
she was my girlfriend.

214
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,119
She was a girl who was my friend
who is now a girl who is not my friend.

215
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,317
Wow, that's, like,
the worst country song ever.

216
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,636
So how are you doing?

217
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,030
-Regarding what?
-Amy.

218
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,159
I don't follow.

219

Well, breakups...

220

...or whatever the hell this is,
can be tough.

221
00:12:28,319 --> 00:12:30,196
Penny, I assure you, I'm fine.

222
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,272
My relationship with Amy
was purely intellectual.

223
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,993
There were no emotional bonds...

224
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,720
...the severing of which
would cause me any discomfort.

225
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:40,234
The relationship simply outlived
its utility...

226
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,119
...and I'm continuing on
with my life as before.

227
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:45,033
Okay. Good.

228
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:48,396
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm off to buy a pussycat.

229
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,871
I gotta tell you guys,
I'm a little worried about Sheldon.

230
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,600
We're all a little worried
about Sheldon.

231
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:59,478
No. I mean, since the Shamy
hit a reef.

232
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:01,595
Oh, I thought you were
making a generalization.

233
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,236
I'm worried about Sheldon someday
setting off a low-yield nuclear device...

234
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,595
...because the cafeteria
ran out of lime Jell-O.

235
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,433
-What does "hit a reef" mean?
-Uh, went splitsville.

236
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:14,951
-Pardon?
-Turned to boom-boom.

237
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:16,718
Ah.

238
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,117
I think Sheldon really misses Amy.

239
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,114
You should lend him your copy
of Bombay Badonkadonks.

240
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,148
-He got a cat to keep him company.
-You're kidding.

241
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:29,072
He takes it everywhere.
To bed, to the bathroom.

242
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,958
He takes the kitty to the potty?

243
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:33,511
I thought we discussed the P-word.

244
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,877
Don't try to change me, dude.
I am what I am.

00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:38,952
-Oh, gentlemen.

Oh, ho, ho.

247
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,672
Aren't you gonna introduce us
to your little friend?

248
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:49,517
My apologies. Raj, Howard, I'd like you
to meet Dr. Robert Oppenheimer.

249
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,791
-Hello.
-Hi.

250
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,633
Now, if you'll excuse me,
the father of the atomic bomb...

251
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,199
...wants a saucer of milk.

252
00:13:59,319 --> 00:14:01,355
Okay, I get it.
We're worried about Sheldon.

253
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,635
Yeah.

the whole Manhattan Project?

257
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,992
Yes. This is Enrico Fermi,
Richard Feynman...

00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,878
...Edward Teller, Otto Frisch.

-Okay, we need to talk.
-About what?

00:14:36,239 --> 00:14:37,558
Cats, Sheldon.

264
00:14:37,719 --> 00:14:39,755
You're clearly upset
about Amy being gone...

265
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,150
...and you're trying to replace her
with cats.

266
00:14:42,319 --> 00:14:43,752
-Clowder.
-What?

267
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:46,991
-Group of cats is a clowder or a glaring.
-Okay, yeah--

268
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,119
It's the kind of thing you ought to know
now that we have one.

269
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,316
Terrific. My point is, you need to face up
to what you're feeling with this breakup.

270
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:59,192
It wasn't a breakup. A breakup
would imply that Amy was--

271
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,549
Okay, I got it.
She's not your girlfriend.

272
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,508
Now, listen to me.
I know about loneliness.

273
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,274
I know about trying
to replace someone with other stuff.

274
00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:11,317
When I broke up with Penny,
I got back into my cello...

275
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,357
...built a bunch of model rockets.

276
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:17,274
I got those weightlifting gloves
and that five-pound dumbbell.

277
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:20,908
You didn't break up, she dumped you.

278
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,117
She didn't dump me. It was mutual.

279
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,999
-l was there. She dumped you.
-Okay, fine.

280
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,038
Live with cats. Be like my Aunt Nancy.
She had dozens of them.

281
00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:33,191
And you know what happened
after she died? They ate her.

282

All right, fellas,
who's in the mood for Fancy Feast?

284
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:48,638
Well, that's not fancy at all.

285

Hi, Mrs. Cooper. Thanks for coming.

00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,158
-Where is he?
-He's in his bedroom.

287
00:15:56,319 --> 00:15:59,117
Now, when you said on the phone
"he broke up with a girl"...

288
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,031
...you meant an actual girl...

289
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,759
...not something
you kids whipped up in a lab?

290
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,279
-No, she's real.
-Did they sin?

291
00:16:07,439 --> 00:16:10,670
No, no. It's not like that. It's, uh....

292
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:12,912
I don't know it's like.

293
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,116
There is something
I should prepare you for.

Oh, relax, Leonard,
l have raised that boy.

295
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,710
I've seen him at his best,
seen him at his worst.

296
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,109
There's nothing he can do
that'll surprise me.

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,671
Hold on to that thought.

00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:36,074
Mom, what an unexpected pleasure.

302
00:16:36,239 --> 00:16:39,788
My, my, that's a powerful smell.

303
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:45,353
I'd like you to meet Oppenheimer,
Frisch, Panofsky, Feynman, Weisskopf--

304
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,350
Yeah, I get it. You got a lot of cats...

305
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,987
...and you gave them
cute Jewish names.

306
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,197
-What are you doing here?
-Leonard called.

307
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,079
He said that you were pining
for a young lady.

308
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,915
Oh, that's preposterous.
I'm not pining over anyone.

309
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,309
Oh, lamb chop,
we can quibble what to call it...

310
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:05,710
...but I think
we can both agree it's creepy.

311
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,911
I do not agree.

312
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,196
Cats make wonderful companions.

313
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,319
They don't argue
or question my intellectual authority.

314
00:17:14,479 --> 00:17:20,236
And this little guy here,
I think you'll find to be quite zazzy.

315
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,915
-You should have called sooner.
-Yeah.

-What is she doing here?
-I called her.

00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:40,153
Your mother thinks
you might be losing your mind over me.

321
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:42,833
As a neurobiologist, l was curious.

God bless you, dear.

326
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,113
Sheldon, sit down. Let's talk.

327
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:58,077
You're not fooling me.
Whenever you say we have to talk...

328
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,832
...it means you want me to listen.

329
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,752
-Then stop talking.
-Yes, ma'am.

330
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,592
Now, the reason I called Amy over...

331
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,990
...was to find out
what type of person she is.

332
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:08,717
And after chatting a bit...

333
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:14,317
...l have to say that while she is
a perfectly unique young woman...

334
00:18:14,479 --> 00:18:17,630
...you two are definitely
not suited for each other.

335
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,918
That's a peculiar conclusion.

336
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:22,309
By any standard,
Amy is more similar to me...

337
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:23,912
...than anyone I've ever met.

338
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:26,639
Oh, I'm sorry, Shelly, I can't see it.

339
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,029
Well, whether you see it or not
is irrelevant.

340
00:18:29,199 --> 00:18:33,033
I can't see subatomic particles,
but nevertheless, they're there.

341
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,760
-Excellent point.
-A physics point.

342
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,072
Touché.

343
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,398
Well, putting aside the pig Latin...

344
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,159
...it's a good that you decided
to end the relationship...

345
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:46,230
...so I didn't have to end it for you.

346
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:52,428
Amy, after consideration,
I believe we may have acted rashly.

347
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:56,592
I propose we resume our relationship
and attempt to resolve our differences.

348
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,875
Only if you stipulate...

349
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:00,553
...80 percent of our difficulties
were caused by you.

350
00:19:00,719 --> 00:19:02,198
-l'll go as high as 40.
-65.

351
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,759
Done.

352
00:19:04,879 --> 00:19:08,872
You understand we deal with the fact
that my mother does not approve?

353
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,719
I do.

354
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:14,151
I find being cast in the role of bad girl
oddly titillating.

355
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,636
-Would you like to see my cats?
-I would.

356
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,029
I love cats.
They're the epitome of indifference.

357
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:24,396
Ah. Then you may find Zazzles
a little cloying.

358
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:27,431
I saw what you did there.

359
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:30,636
He thinks he's such a smarty pants,
he's no different from any man.

360
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,393
Tell them not to do something,
that's all they wanna do.

361
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:36,835
If I hadn't told my brother Stumpy
not to clear the wood chipper by hand...

362
00:19:36,999 --> 00:19:38,512
...we'd still be calling him Edward.

363
00:19:40,439 --> 00:19:42,873
Now, don't you move,
I'll bring over all the food.

364
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:44,717
No, no, no, I can do it.

365
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:48,914
Well, isn't that sweet?
