00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,470
I assure you lam quite real...

333
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,315
...and I'm having regular intercourse
with your daughter.

334
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:29,990
-What?
-Oh, yes.

335
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:32,912
We are like wild animals in heat.

336
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:36,031
It's a wonder
neither of us has been hurt.

337
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,917
Amy, what is he saying?

338
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:43,867
You wanted me to have a boyfriend,
mother. Well, here he is.

339
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:47,878
Have to sign off now.

340
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:50,155
My hunger for Sheldon
is stirring in my loins.

341
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,229
Oh, yes. It's time for me to make love
to your daughter's vagina.

342
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,389
MRS. FOWLER:
Oh!

343
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,910
-Thank you. That went very well.
-Agreed.

344
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,752
Amy, I find myself wondering...

345
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,470
...if we should actually engage in coitus
at least one time in our relationship.

346
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:13,475


347
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:16,717
Bedtime,
please show yourself out.

348
