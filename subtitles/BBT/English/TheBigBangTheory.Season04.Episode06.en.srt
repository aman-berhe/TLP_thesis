that you didn't tell Raj...

336
00:17:37,879 --> 00:17:40,871
...about the time you dropped
his iPhone in a urinal?

337
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:43,912
Dude, I put that thing on my face.

338
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:46,593
I think a more amusing violation
of Raj's trust...

339
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:48,192
...is when Howard convinced him...

340
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,749
...that foreigners give presents
to Americans on Thanksgiving.

342
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,113
Hey, I didn't see you giving back
your Snoopy Sno-Cone maker.

343
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:00,271
Wait, that was all a lie?
This year's gifts are already wrapped.

344
00:18:00,439 --> 00:18:01,758
As long as we're talking...

345
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:04,991
...how about the month Sheldon spent
grinding up insects...

346
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,912
...and mixing them
into Leonard's food?

347
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:09,798
Well, excuse me.
That was not a betrayal.

348
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:11,358
-Oh.
-That was an experiment...

349
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,832
...to determine at what concentration
food starts tasting mothy.

350
00:18:16,639 --> 00:18:18,709
You put moths in my food?

351
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:21,995
For science.

352
00:18:22,719 --> 00:18:24,869
I can't believe you kissed my sister
with moth mouth.

353
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,952
Well, uh-- I can't believe you'd use
Sheldon's toothbrush.

354
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,236
You used my toothbrush?

355
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,039
Not the brush part.
Just the little rubber thing...

356
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,510
...to pick food from my teeth
and massage my gums.

357
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:45,676
Okay, l-- I think it's safe to say...

358
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,877
...that we've all done some things
we're not particularly proud of.

minor lapses.

For the record, Howard,
I'm sorry that I broke our pact.

363
00:18:59,719 --> 00:19:01,118
Thank you.

364
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,432
And I'm sorry about your phone
and Thanksgiving.

365
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:09,872
And while we're at it, you don't have to
wash our clothes on the 4th of July.

366
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:15,596
As long as we're apologizing, Sheldon,
I'm sorry I used your toothbrush.

367
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,559
And I'm sorry...

368
00:19:17,719 --> 00:19:20,916
...but that behavior is beyond the pale
and cannot be tolerated.

369
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:22,910
We are no longer friends.

00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:26,750
I got you a talking Thomas

Yes.

00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,759
All right.
