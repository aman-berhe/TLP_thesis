with me and women?

Nothing, it was a desperate attempt...

...to introduce
an alternate topic of conversation.

6
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:19,635
My problem
is I don't project confidence.

7

So I decided that the next time I meet
a woman I think is attractive...

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,550

and being cautious...

Hey, buddies.

to work on the giant space laser.

-Background interviews didn't go well.

-Yeah, but why should that keep me up?

203

is caused by a guilty conscience?

-You're having a guilt-ridden dream.

...he was on the verge of giving away
rocket secrets to a North Korean spy...

ever investigated that.

-But I actually didn't demote Pluto.

339
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:29,036
-Hello, all.
LEONARD: Hello.

340
00:18:29,199 --> 00:18:33,192
Howard, you're feeling better
about me today, aren't you?

341
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,597
-Not really.
-Yes, you are.

342
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:41,116
I'm using neuro-linguistic programming
to modify your thought patterns.

343
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,757
Go away, Sheldon.

344
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:47,879
There's a 9.95 eBook
down the drain.

345
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:50,270
-What's in the bag?
-lt's for Howard.

346
00:18:50,439 --> 00:18:53,158
No, Sheldon,
you can't fix this with gifts.

347
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,477
Nevertheless, I've hurt you
and whether you forgive me or not...

348
00:18:56,679 --> 00:18:58,556
...I want you to have this.

349
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,550
You're giving me a couch cushion?

350
00:19:02,719 --> 00:19:04,835
No. The cushion is merely symbolic.

351
00:19:04,999 --> 00:19:07,593
I'm giving you my spot on the couch.

352
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:11,478
But you love that spot.

353
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,829
No, I love my mother.

354
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,629
My feelings for my spot
are much greater.

355
00:19:18,439 --> 00:19:23,388
It's the singular location in space around
which revolves my entire universe.

356
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:25,958
And now it's yours.

357
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,316
Oh, my God, dude,
now you have to forgive him.

358
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,353
All right. Uh, apology accepted.

359
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:36,433
High five.

360
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:38,396
Not too hard.

361
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,078
Thank you.

362
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:44,396
I haven't cried like this
since Toy Story 3.

363
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:56,151
I gotta tell you, Sheldon,
I understand why you chose this spot.

364
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:59,038
I mean, the temperature's good,
but there's no draft.

365
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:01,588
I can see the television,
but I can still talk to--

366
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,716
I changed my mind.
Get out of my spot.

367
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,836
-How long?
-Ninety-four seconds.

368
00:20:37,639 --> 00:20:39,630
