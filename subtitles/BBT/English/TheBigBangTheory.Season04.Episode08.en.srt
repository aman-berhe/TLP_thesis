["RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK"
THEME PLAYING ON TV]

2
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,995
Okay, help me out here.

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,709
How does an archeology professor
get that good with a whip?

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,710
Maybe he took a class at the
adult bookstore. That's howl learned.

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,435
I can't believe you've never seen
Raiders of the Lost Ark.

6
00:00:28,639 --> 00:00:31,995
And I can't believe you've never read
Eat, Pray, Love.

7
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,189
When she comes out with Eat, Pray, Run
Away From a Giant Boulder, I'll read it.

8
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:42,750
I don't care if Eat, Pray, Love,
changed your life, I'm not reading it.

9
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,836
You know,
I could totally rock a hat like that.

10
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,510
That's the work of noted Hollywood
costume designer Deborah Nadoolman.

11
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,679
She designed the red and blackjacket
in Michael Jackson's "Thriller" video...

12
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,956
...which I've never viewed
in its entirety...

13
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,032
...as I find zombies dancing
in synchronicity implausible.

14
00:01:01,319 --> 00:01:03,674
And also, it's really scary.

15
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,678
Could someone please turn off
the Sheldon commentary track?

16
00:01:07,399 --> 00:01:10,232
There's no switch.
Just listen and learn.

17
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,509
Penny,
you should come with us Friday...

18
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,875
...to see it on the big screen
at the Colonial.

19
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:18,428
I'm watching it now.
Why would I wanna see it again?

20
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,272
Because the print they're showing...

21
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,319
...has an additional 21 seconds
of previously unseen footage.

22
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,229
Wha-- Twenty-one seconds?
That'll be like seeing a whole new movie.

23
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,798
Exactly. They say it finally solves
the submarine controversy.

24
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,108
Leonard, I'm no expert, but I believe
what we just heard from Penny...

25
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,396
...was sarcasm.

26
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,672
Oh, good. I'm 8-for-26 this month.

27
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,870
Yeah, I think I'll pass. But you guys
enjoy your extra 21 seconds.

28
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:50,714
If I could make you understand why this
is a cool thing, we'd still be together.

29
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,798
Hmm.... Yeah. No, we wouldn't.

30
00:01:54,839 --> 00:01:57,831
Uh-huh. I'm guessing 21 seconds
had something to do with that too.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,274
[CHUCKLES]

32
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,070
May I point out to you all that
the screening is first come, first served?

33
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:36,476
Relax, it's 5:00.
The movie doesn't start till midnight.

34
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,031
Another way of saying that is: the movie
starts at midnight and it's already 5:00.

35
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,118
If we miss it, we'll have the fun of
listening to Sheldon...

36
00:02:45,279 --> 00:02:47,349
...whine about it
for the rest of our lives.

37
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:50,073
See? Howard's on my side.

38
00:02:50,559 --> 00:02:53,551
Actually, I'm not.
I'm using sarcasm to mock you.

39
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,832
Drat. Now I'm 8-for-27.

40
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,232
Don't worry, Sheldon. We'll be fine.

41
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,154
What happened to the Leonard who
waited in line with me for 14 hours...

42
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:05,549
...to see the premiere
of Star Trek: Nemesis?

43
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,799
Oh, well, he waited in line for 14 hours
while you napped in a lawn chair...

44
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,633
...he got in a fight
when he stepped out of line to pee...

45
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:14,994
...and you wouldn't wake up
to vouch for him.

46
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,958
And worst of all,
he saw Star Trek: Nemesis.

47
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,999
But how were our seats?

48
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:22,555
-Excellent.
-I rest my case.

49
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,593
Amy, don't you agree we should
leave now and get in line?

50
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,470
As the newest member
of your social group...

51
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:33,791
...l'll gain more acceptance by siding
with your friends from time to time.

52
00:03:34,999 --> 00:03:36,637
Shrewd.

53
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,838
Leonard, you're right.
We should enjoy our meal, arrive late...

54
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,635
...and risk winding up with terrible seats,
assuming we get in at all.

55
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,833
Thank you, Amy.

00:03:46,999 --> 00:03:48,990

bacteria into the monkey lab.

I'd say I told you so...

vehemence and frequency already...

with the phrase "I informed you thusly."
