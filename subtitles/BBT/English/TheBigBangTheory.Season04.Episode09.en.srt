I'll friend you on Facebook.

334
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,995
Oh, there you are.

335
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:08,911
Just so you know, I was up all night...

336
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,913
...but I've finally completed
the Penny-specific section...

337
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,071
...of the new Roommate Agreement.

338
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:17,434
Yeah? Well, not necessary,
we broke up again.

339
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:32,238
Do you even think about other people,
Leonard?

340
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,710
Do you?

341
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,432
Hey. Oh, how did it go last night?

342
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,109
Oh, you know. Same old, same old.

343
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:52,191
Looked through a telescope,
saw some stars, big whoop.

344
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,313
Really? You waited months
for time with that telescope.

345
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,835
-What happened?
-Why, you writing a book?

346
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,791
I'm going to propose a hypothesis.

347
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:05,111
Last night, Raj accidentally made
contact with an alien civilization...

348
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,075
...and has been ordered by the
U.S. government to keep it a secret.

349
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,756
Nothing happened.
Can we change the subject?

350
00:19:13,959 --> 00:19:16,632
That sounds rehearsed.
We are not alone.

351
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:19,917
HOWARD: Hey.
SHELDON: Hello.

352
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,879
-Hey.
-Hey.

353
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:26,676
Did you get to play
with Raj's big telescope last night?

354
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,476
-Wha--?
-Wha--?

355
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,668
-Where did that come from?
-He never touched my telescope.

356
00:19:33,879 --> 00:19:36,347
-Way to go shutting up.
-I did shut up. Now you shut up.

357
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:38,316
-Fine.
-Thank you.

358
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,235
I can't believe
you didn't call me this morning.

359
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,631
