1
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:13,597
Clarify something for me.

2
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,753
Isn't the point of a communal meal
the exchange of ideas and opinions...

3
00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:21,752
...an opportunity to consider
important issues of the day?

4
00:00:21,919 --> 00:00:24,831
It is. You just kind of put a damper
on things when you said:

5
00:00:24,999 --> 00:00:28,878
"The next person I see talking with
food in their mouth will be put to death."

6
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,749
We could argue about
who said what all night...

7
00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:34,387
...but to set things back on course...

8
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,993
...I will propose a new topic
of conversation.

9
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:38,148
-Ugh.
-Great.

10
00:00:38,319 --> 00:00:40,958
What is the best number?

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,476
By the way,
there's only one correct answer.

12
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:48,632
Five million, three hundred,
eighteen thousand and eight?

13
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:53,077
Wrong. The best number is 73.

14
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,509
You're probably wondering why.

15
00:00:57,679 --> 00:00:58,714
-No.
RAJESH: No, we're good.

16
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,950
Seventy three
is the 21st prime number.

17
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,076
It's mirror, 37, is the 12th...

18
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:07,552
...and its mirror, 21, is the product
of multiplying-- Hang on to your hats.

19
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:09,675
--seven and three.

20
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,712
Heh? Heh? Did I lie?

21
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,395
We get it.
73 is the Chuck Norris of numbers.

22
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,394
Chuck Norris wishes.

23
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:22,709
In binary, 73 is a palindrome:

24
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,074
One, zero, zero, one...

25
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,355
...zero, zero, one.

26
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,592
Which, backwards,
is one, zero, zero, one, zero, zero, one.

27
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:29,874
Exactly the same.

28
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:34,032
All Chuck Norris backwards
gets you is "sirron kcuhc."

29
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:39,555
Just for the record, when you enter
5,318,008 in a calculator...

30
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:42,028
...upside down, it spells "boobies."

31
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:48,512
Remember wondering why
the girls didn't wanna eat with us?

32
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,238
Yeah, I get it now.

33
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,154
-I love your heart locket, Bernadette.
-Oh, thanks. Howard gave it to me.

34
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,308
It's the cutest thing.

35
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,074
Every time I have dinner with his mom,
the next day l getjewelry.

36
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,235
Did you know the Valentine's heart
is not based on the shape of a heart...

37
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,550
...but rather on the shape of
the buttocks of a female bending over?

38
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,597
Oh. So I spent seventh grade
dotting my l's with little asses?

39
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,829
Cool.

40
00:02:20,279 --> 00:02:23,032
-Hey. Penny, how's it going?
-Hey, Zack. What are you doing here?

41
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,395
My dad's company prints menus
for this place.

42
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:27,277
Dropping off some new ones,
laminated.

43
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,556
Easier to clean
if people throw up on them.

44
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,713
-Guess how I got the idea.
-Yeah, I got it. I got it.

45
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,197
Ahem. Uh, Zack, these are my friends
Bernadette and Amy.

46
00:02:37,359 --> 00:02:38,394
-Hi.
-Hey.

47
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:40,675
Hoo.

48
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:46,116
-Okay, well, it was good to see you.
-Yeah, you too.

49
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:49,430
-He's really cute. How do you know him?
-Oh, we went out a couple times.

50
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,317
I'm often flummoxed by current slang.

51
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,994
Does "went out" mean
"had intercourse"?

52
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,078
-Yes.
-No. No.

53
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,472
But in this case, yes.

54
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:02,037
-lnteresting. And was it not satisfactory?
-No, it was great.

55
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,431
He just didn't really challenge me
on an intellectual level.

56
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,955
Couldn't you just fool around with him
and then listen to NPR?

57
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:13,192
Wouldn't help.
Zack can't even spell NPR.

58
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:15,153
It's what I do with Howard.

59
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:16,718
I'm much smarter than he is...

60
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,155
...but it's important
to protect his manhood.

61
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,919
Hoo.

62
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,834
-What's the matter?
-l'm suddenly feeling flushed.

63
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,152
My heart rate is elevated,
my palms are clammy, my mouth is dry.

64
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,676
In addition,
I keep involuntarily saying "hoo."

65
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,228
Oh, we know what's causing that,
don't we?

66
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,435
It's no mystery.

67
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,479
I obviously have the flu, coupled with
sudden-onset Tourette's syndrome.

68
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,476
You hear about the accident
at the bio lab?

69
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,833
-No.
-What happened?

70
00:04:13,999 --> 00:04:18,311
They were injecting rats with radioactive
isotopes and one of the techs got bit.

71
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:20,549
Did he get superpowers?

72
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,996
No, he got five stitches
and a tetanus shot.

73
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,149
Oh.

74
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:29,116
Well, that's disappointing.

75
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,395
-Why?
-on.

76
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,630
You get bit by radioactive animal
in a lab...

77
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,791
...you kind of wanna
turn into a superhero.

78
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,829
Yeah, but who'd wanna become
Rat Man?

79
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:40,078
Who wouldn't?

80
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,715
You could zip through a maze
in nothing flat...

81
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:47,838
...squeeze through small holes and
shut down restaurants in a single bound.

82
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,911
And the best part is,
if I were Rat Man...

83
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:52,229
...you could be my sidekick,
Mouse Boy.

84
00:04:57,559 --> 00:04:58,833
Mouse Boy?

85
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,356
You don't like Mouse Boy?
How about, uh, Kid Vermin?

86
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:05,556
First of all, if we had superpowers,
I wouldn't be the sidekick.

87
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,474
-You'd be the sidekick.
-Rat Man is nobody's sidekick.

88
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,276
Leonard, settle this, of the two of us,
who's the obvious sidekick?

89
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,429
Yeah, Leonard, who?

90
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,717
Twelve years after high school
and I'm still at the nerd table.

91
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:28,588
Aren't you slicing that man's brain
a little too thin?

92
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:36,235
It's too thin if I were making a foot-long
brain sandwich at Quizno's.

93
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:39,834
For examination
under a two photon microscope...

94
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,070
...it's fine.

95
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,519
Well, you're the expert.

96
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:50,354
If the correct way to do it
is the wrong way, then I yield.

97
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:53,158
Very well, if you die and donate
your body to science...

98
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,628
...I promise to slice your brain
like Canadian bacon.

99
00:05:56,919 --> 00:05:58,557
Thank you.

100
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,837
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to take my temperature.

101
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:04,075
Are you monitoring
your circadian rhythms...

102
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:07,311
...in order to identify your periods
of maximum mental acuity?

103
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:08,548
I did that one summer.

104
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,836
Ah, youth.

105
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,109
No, I experienced distressing symptoms
last night...

106
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,350
...so I'm checking
my vital signs every hour.

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,993
I'd be happy to create a chart and
participate in a differential diagnosis.

108
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:22,751
Oh, that sounds like fun.

109
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:27,234
All right. Ahem.

110
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:28,918
What were the symptoms?

111
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:32,549
Elevated heart rate, moist palms,
dry mouth...

112
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:35,438
...and localized vascular throbbing.

113
00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:39,472
Localized to what region?

114
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:43,473
Ears and genitalia.

115
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,428
Interesting.

116
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:48,067
Not body parts that usually team up.

117
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:54,914
What about environmental factors?
Describe the scene for me.

118
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:57,673
l was in a restaurant with Penny
and Bernadette, drinking water.

119
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:00,592
Carbonated, as it was
a special occasion.

120
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:05,038
Penny's friend Zack stopped by
and said hello and I said "hoo."

121
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,470
-Who?
-Zack.

122
00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:11,117
-Then why did you ask?
-Ask what?

123
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:13,349
-"Who?"
-Zack.

124
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,317
All right, let's start over.

125
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,471
What did you say
when Zack walked in?

126
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,028
-Hoo.
-Zack.

127
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,272
-Why do you keep saying Zack?
-Because you keep saying, "Who?"

128
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:26,907
I'm not saying "hoo" now,
I said "hoo" last night.

129
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,115
And the answer was Zack, correct?

130
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:32,438
There was no question,
I simply said, "Hoo."

131
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,789
All right.
I think I have enough to go on.

132
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,755
Possible explanations
for your symptoms are...

133
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,716
...in descending order of likelihood...

134
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,108
...hyperthyroidism...

135
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:45,553
...premature menopause...

136
00:07:45,719 --> 00:07:47,949
...hosting an alien parasite...

137
00:07:48,119 --> 00:07:52,317
...or, and I only include it for the sake of
covering absolutely all bases...

138
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,630
...sexual arousal.

139
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,672
Where would I have picked up
an alien parasite?

140
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,112
-There you are.
-Oh, hey.

141
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:07,077
Let me ask you a question.
What are you most afraid of?

142
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,795
I don't know. Uh....

143
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,508
Nuclear war, being buried alive.
Any of those movies where you get...

144
00:08:12,679 --> 00:08:16,433
...that phone call that says
you're going to die, and then you do.

145
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:19,193
No, something very specific
that we both know you...

146
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,158
...Rajesh Koothrappalli,
are terrified of.

147
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:24,994
Well, type two diabetes
runs in my family.

148
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,869
-The thought of losing a toe--
-Spiders. You're afraid of spiders.

149
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,637
-What the heck is this?
-Ajar with a big spider in it, of course.

150
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:37,758
Bravery test. First one to take
his hand out is the sidekick.

151
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,239
RAJESH:
Wha--?

152
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:42,672
-Are you crazy?
-Perhaps.

153
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,754
-Are you scared?
-No. But it's a stupid test.

154
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,955
Oh, really?

155
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,998
What if the Earth was in danger
and the only way to save it...

156
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:54,151
...was to stick your hand in ajar
with a spider?

157
00:08:54,319 --> 00:08:57,595
Yeah? What if the only way to save it
was to shower in the locker room...

158
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:59,431
...and let other guys see you naked?

159
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,795
Oh, come on.
That's never gonna happen.

160
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,719
Now, put your hand in the jar
or forever be revealed as my sidekick.

161
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,268
All right, I will.

162
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:15,469
How did you get so brave
all of a sudden?

163
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,994
It's easy.
The spider's crawling up your arm.

164
00:09:18,319 --> 00:09:20,628
[SCREAMING]

165
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:25,710
Get it off me, get it off me.

166
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:27,597
Please, Raj!

167
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,552
Please!

168
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,990
My blood work shows
thyroid function normal.

Sheldon, I am not going
through menopause.

172
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,950
Are you sure? You said that
with the testy bark of an old biddy.

173
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,429
I think we need to face
the cold, hard truth.

174
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,717
l was sexually aroused
by Penny's friend Zack.

175
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:58,868
Hang on.

176
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,477
I don't know that we've given the
alien parasite hypothesis a fair shake.

177
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:06,551
Let's look at this logically.
l have a stomach, I get hungry.

178
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,359
l have genitals, l have the potential
for sexual arousal.

179
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,072
A cross we all must bear.

180
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,391
You know,
in difficult moments like this...

181
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,233
...I often turn to a force greater
than myself.

182
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,991
-Religion?
-Star Trek.

183
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,435

00:10:25,599 --> 00:10:26,873
-No.
-Don't. It's terrible.

drawn off the path of logic...

...by feelings bubbling up
from his human half...

00:10:35,439 --> 00:10:39,148

Vulcan mental discipline of Kolinahr.

192
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:57,397
Using Kolinahr to suppress my anger
at that last comment.

193
00:10:58,239 --> 00:11:00,230
Is it possible
that your concern for me...

194
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,833
...is motivated by nothing more
than simple jealousy?

195
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:08,672
I hadn't considered that.
Give me a moment.

196
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,995
-All right. I've considered it.
-And?

197
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:14,592
l reject it.

198
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,435
You reject it
because you don't feel jealousy...

199
00:11:17,599 --> 00:11:20,352
...or because you are
suppressing jealousy?

200

204
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:37,389
...you can see howl could
mistake them for my sashimi.

00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:46,150
-Hello.
-Hey.

00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:48,514

your usual laundry night?

207

The supermarket was out of
my regular fabric softener.

208
00:11:51,719 --> 00:11:56,793
If this one under- or over-softens,
I'll need time to make things right.

209
00:11:56,999 --> 00:11:58,478
That's thinking ahead.

210
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,392
The alternative would be
to think backwards...

211
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,033
...and that's just remembering.

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,237

I thought she was a highly evolved
creature of pure intellect, like me...

216
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,988

she may be a slave to her baser urges.
