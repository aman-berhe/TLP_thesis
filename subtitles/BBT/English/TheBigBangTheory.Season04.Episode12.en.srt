look like? It looks like an envelope!

who can't master technology...

we made an example of one or two...

15
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:50,868
...it might give the others
incentive to try harder.

00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,393
I had a great idea.
You know how we're always having...

...to stop
and solve differential equations...

18
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:01,235
...like when you do Fourier analysis
or using the Schrodinger equation?

Howard doesn't. He's only an engineer.

20
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,913
I think we could write a little app that
would use handwriting recognition...

21
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,469
...then run it through
a symbolic evaluation engine.

take a picture of the equation, and bam!

that's actually a valid idea. Very good.

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,917

are equally surprising...

off stuff like this.

No. You take girls underwater
in your private submarine...

-Dear Lord, we're doomed.

It certainly buoyed up this employee's
esprit de corps.

121
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,116
It's not ajoke. It's the real design.

In that case, may I offer 27 little tweaks
to make it slightly less embarrassing?

Let's just try it my way.

124
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,996
Oh, I'm sorry.
I assumed that you wanted...

00:07:15,159 --> 00:07:17,150
...candid truth-telling
from your employees.

126
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,754

you want the mindless nattering...

-If you say so, boss.

-We're not doing names now. Howard?
-Like I was saying...

136
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:53,877
...now, it's a dummy procedure.
Eventually, it will drop us in--

00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,837
If we're not going to give it a name...

138
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,639
...can we at least give it
a secret code designation?

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,548
-ls that decision open for discussion?
-No.

148
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,637
Is the decision to not discuss...

00:08:24,799 --> 00:08:26,357
-...open for discussion?
-No.

150
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:28,477
Again, right now...

151
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,392
...it's a dummy procedure,
but eventually, it will drop us--

160

condemnation you and I know it to be.

334
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:38,193
Yeah, that was my plan.
All right. Come on. Let's go.

335
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,716
By the way,
thank you for the delicious cocoa.

336
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,189
-Oh, you're welcome.
-Oh, I'm getting good at this.

337
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,832
Okay, now that you're back on the team
let's get you caught up.

338
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,197
Before you begin, let me say again
how deeply sorry I am...

339
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,759
...for my earlier behavior...

340
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,151
...and how much I respect and admire
your leadership.

341
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,197
Thank you.

342
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:08,552
So as you can see...

343
00:19:08,719 --> 00:19:11,233
...not only can you store
your favorite equations...

344
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,595
...but you can forward them
to your friends...

345
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:17,115
...or post them on Facebook
right from the app.

346
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:19,549
-Well, I must say, I am impressed.
-Thanks.

347
00:19:19,719 --> 00:19:22,916
-You all have put in a lot of hard work.
-We have.

348
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:26,389
You have taken the most important step
on the road to success:

349
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,029
Learning what not to do.
Now, let's start fresh.

350
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,153

354
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:50,947
You said it yourself,
we have to create a database...

355
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,951
...before you can write an algo-thingy.

356
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:56,669
Algorithm. You see, Penny,
Alan Turing defines an algorithm--

357
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,398
