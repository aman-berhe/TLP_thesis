00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,671
Good evening. I'm your guest lecturer,
Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

2
00:00:11,999 --> 00:00:15,355
l was expecting applause.

3
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,307
But I suppose stunned silence
is equally appropriate.

4
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,313
I agreed to speak to you
this evening...

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,278
...because I was told
you're the best and the brightest...

6
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,907
...of this university's
doctoral candidates.

7
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,196
Hmm. That's like saying
you're the most important electron...

8
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,555
...in a hydrogen atom. Ha, ha.

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,149
Because, you see,
there's only one electron...

10
00:00:39,319 --> 00:00:41,275
...in a hydrogen atom.

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,032
Best and brightest,
my sweet patootie.

12
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,350
All right. Let's begin. Show of hands.

13
00:00:48,519 --> 00:00:52,353
Who here is familiar with the concept
of topological insulators?

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,748
Heh. Don't kid yourselves.

15
00:00:57,319 --> 00:00:59,708
I found another tweet from a student.

16
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,314
"Dr. Cooper has taken
a relatively boring subject...

17
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,676
...and managed to make it
completely insufferable.

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,231
Plus, he looks like a giant insect."

Dr. Cooper, it falls out of the sky dead?"

uploaded them to their Flickr account.

Wow. How do you get an entire lecture
hall to flip you off at the same time?

26
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:32,272
Apparently, if you're Sheldon,
all you need to do is turn your back.

I can't get on.

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,188

It's now "Penny is a freeloader."

00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,631
Thanks. What are you guys doing?

32
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,473
Sheldon gave a lecture tonight.
We're reading the reviews.

33
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,789
Oh, how did he do?

34
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,272
Picture the Hindenburg meets Chernobyl
meets Three Mile Island meets Tron 2.

35
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,395
That bad, huh?

36
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,596
Read this woman's tweet.

"Listening to Dr. Cooper has made me
wanna start cutting myself again."

38
00:02:02,199 --> 00:02:03,427
Yeah. Ha-ha-ha.

41
00:02:11,359 --> 00:02:12,997
So how did the lecture go?

42
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,515
In a word, triumphant.

43
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,319
-Really? Triumphant?
-Oh, yes.

44
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,313
Should've seen those people.
They're thirsty for knowledge...

45
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,754
...drinking in my wisdom.

46
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,714
I may have changed a few lives today.

47

Oh, please, let me tell him.

48
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,397
I don't know.
I kind of promised Howard.

49
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,828
-Tell me what?
-Actually, we should share the moment.

50

Raj, if you would.

51
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,991
Oh, tweets about my lecture.

Hmm.

53
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,115
That's rather unfair.

54
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:52,151
That's downright cruel.

55
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,549
Plus, insects have six legs.

I'm not familiar
with the acronym KMN.

57
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,837
Oh, from the context,
we think it means "kill me now."

58
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,749
Well, I suppose everyone's entitled
to their own opinion.

59
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,147
I think I'll turn in.

60
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,278
I didn't wanna teach
those poopy heads anyway.

61
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,309
FYI,
I think that's what Darth Vader said...

62
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,517
...just before
he started building the Death Star.

-Sheldon still moping?
-Yeah, it's weird.

64
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:55,033
Though he didn't wanna give the lecture,
being rejected by students hit him hard.

65
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,112
Hmm, I know the feeling. Like
accidentally walking into a gay bar...

66
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,554
...then having no one hit on you.

67
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:09,912
It happened to a friend of mine.

00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:14,199
-Are you doing okay?
-Yeah, Leonard and l are fine...

69
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:16,919
...but I think Raj
needs to meet a girl really soon.

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,149
That shouldn't be too hard.

Oh, thank you.
But cute is for bunnies.

For the record,
Labradoodles are hypoallergenic...

Do you realize teaching
is the first thing I've failed at...

...since my ill-fated attempt
to complete a chin-up in March of 1989?

If this experience is troubling you
there are things we could do about it.

-For instance?
-The first thing that comes to mind...

90
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,994
...is isolating the part of your brain
where memory is stored...

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,196

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,716

improving your socialization skills...

to communicate more effectively?

Fair enough. But in its essence,
teaching is a performance art.

100
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,434

has the responsibility to communicate...
