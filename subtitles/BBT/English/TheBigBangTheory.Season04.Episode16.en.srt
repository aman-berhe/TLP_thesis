...falls to the closest male member
of her family, in this case, Raj.

139
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,277
The code also states
that if she disobeys...

00:08:35,439 --> 00:08:40,877
...she will be reborn in the womb
of a jackal and tormented by diseases.

141

Priya, if you're experiencing
any tension or awkwardness...

151
00:09:19,439 --> 00:09:22,317

that Leonard and Penny used to...

out there with the humidifier.

-No, it's not great.
