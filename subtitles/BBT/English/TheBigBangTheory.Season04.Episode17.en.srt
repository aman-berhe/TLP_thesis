Um, ahem, hi, I'm Stuart.

170
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:34,117
I run a comic book store...

171
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:37,794
...which, for financial reasons,
I'm currently living in.

172
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,109
And I guess what I'm hoping for most
out of tonight is a hot shower.

173

That's very nice, Stuart. Zack?

Of course. Barry?

I'm Barry Kripke and I'm here
because you told me there was a raffle.

When is the raffle?

Ahem.

...is the grand finale to an evening-long
festival of fun and folly.

00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:17,837
-One more question--
-Yes, you must be present to win.

-Ha, ha. What's up?

188
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,669
We're here to kidnap you
for a girls' night out.

189
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,468
Parenthetical, the term "kidnap"
is being used playfully.

190
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:41,153
I kind of figured that.

wouldn't have had all this jibberjabber.

Anyway, after snowboarding,
I go to the lodge and get in the Jacuzzi.

206

There's no one around,
so naturally I'm free-balling it.

Next thing I know,
this beautiful chick shows up.

208
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,629
Drunk out of her skull,
wants to get in with me.

209
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:41,038
Question. Was it a Jacuzzi or a hot tub?

210
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,994
-Really, that's your question?
-What's the difference?

211
00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:48,987
Jacuzzi is a commercial brand,
hot tub is the generic term...

212
00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:53,636
...i.e., all Jacuzzis are hot tubs
but not all hot tubs are Jacuzzis.

213
00:11:54,319 --> 00:11:58,437
Is that like all thumbs are fingers
but not all fingers are thumbs?

214
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,276
Surprisingly, yes.

215
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,910
Nice.

Can you please
get back to the drunk girl?

218
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,749
I'd like something to think about
in the shower.

219
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,793
Oh, yeah, right.

220
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,235
She takes off all of her clothes,
climbs in the hot tub.

221
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:20,516
-And the first thing I notice--
-The water level rose.

222
00:12:22,319 --> 00:12:23,832
-No.
-Well, of course it did.

223
00:12:23,999 --> 00:12:26,797
It's said that Archimedes,
the ancient Greek mathematician...

224
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,475
...discovered the principle
of displacement while taking a bath.

225
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:34,711
Terrific. Go ahead, Zack.

Wait, forgive me...

227
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:38,794
...but I think you'll find
my story is more interesting.

228
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:41,229
Does yours have wet breasts in it?

229
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,471
Better, it has a gold crown.

230
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,274
You see, the king wondered
how much gold was in it...

231
00:12:47,439 --> 00:12:50,476
...and charged Archimedes
with coming up with the solution.

232
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,110
The crown was irregularly shaped, there
was no way to determine its volume.

233
00:12:54,319 --> 00:12:56,833
But while bathing,
Archimedes realized...

234
00:12:56,999 --> 00:13:01,754
...he could immerse the crown
and measure the amount the water rose.

235
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:06,596
So long story short, I nailed her.

236
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,596

he shouted, "Eureka."

Now, was this before or after
he adopted the 25 cats?

334
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:23,719
Long before the cats.
I think it was around the time...

Would you like some homemade chili?

Are there beans in it?

-Yes.
-Oh, then it's not chili.

Real chili has no beans in it.
