1
00:00:04,159 --> 00:00:08,994
SHELDON: Why hast thou forsaken me,
oh, deity, whose existence I doubt?

2
00:00:09,999 --> 00:00:12,513
Here, breathe into this bag.

3
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:17,434
-What's going on?
SHELDON: They stole everything.

4
00:00:17,599 --> 00:00:18,748
Everything.

5
00:00:19,599 --> 00:00:22,477
-Are you the roommate?
-Leonard Hofstadter. What happened?

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,676
Your friend called 911
to report a robbery.

7
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:26,477
Oh, my God, what did they get?

8
00:00:26,639 --> 00:00:27,674
What didn't they get?

9
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:31,434
They got my enchanted weapons,
my Vicious Gladiator armor...

10
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,036
...my Wand of Untainted Power
and all my gold.

11
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:38,274
You called the police...

12
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,637
...because someone hacked
your "World of Warcraft" account?

13
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:43,118
What choice did I have?

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,158
The mighty Sheldor,
level 85 blood elf...

15
00:00:46,319 --> 00:00:48,037
...hero of the Eastern Kingdoms...

16
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,671
...has been picked clean
like a carcass in the desert sun.

17
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,596
Plus, the FBI hung up on me.

18
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,988
[SHELDON HYPERVENTILATING]

19
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:58,911
Into the bag.

20
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,472
They took my battle ostrich.

21
00:01:02,639 --> 00:01:05,756
-Oh, no, not Glenn.
-Yes. Glenn.

22
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,593
Only bird I ever loved.

23
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:11,278
Good luck, fellas.

24
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,872
Oh, thank you, officer.

25
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:15,553
Wait a minute.
You're not going to do anything?

26
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:17,914
-Mr. Cooper, there's nothing--
-Dr. Cooper.

27
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,512
Seriously?

28
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,076
Not the kind with access to drugs.

29
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,517
Fine. Dr. Cooper,
I'm sorry for your loss...

30
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,834
...but the Pasadena Police Department
doesn't have jurisdiction in Pandora.

31
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,317
That's from Avatar.

32
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,916
"World of Warcraft" takes place
in Azeroth.

33
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,957
Goodness gracious,
how are you allowed to carry a gun?

34
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,354
Can you at least refer me
to a rogue ex-cop?

35
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,432
What?

36
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:53,035
One who was drummed off the force
because he refused to play by the rules.

37
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,679
And now he hires himself out...

38
00:01:54,839 --> 00:01:57,672
...to impose his own brand
of rough justice?

39
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,192


40
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:04,235
Thank you, officer.

41
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,708
It's all gone. All gone.

42
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:09,991
-l'm really sorry, Sheldon.
-What kind of world do we live in...

43
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,869
...where a man would take
another man's battle ostrich?

44
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,549
I don't know.

45
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,234
This act of aggression must be met
with swift and cruel ferocity.

46
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,678
It is time to cry havoc
and let slip the dogs of war.

47
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,671
I'm on it.

48
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,312
Hi, Mrs. Wolowitz. Is Howard there?

49
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,753
Okay, thanks.

50
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:39,918
That particular dog of war will
have to call you back after his bath.

51
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:44,477
See if Raj is done with Pilates.

52
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,152
Three thousand hours.

53
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:17,075
Three thousand hours clicking on that
mouse, collecting weapons and gold.

54
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:20,911
It's almost as if
it was a huge waste of time.

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,513
They knew what they were doing.

56
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,274
He got in and out of your account
in under 15 minutes...

57
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,512
...transferred all your stuff,
didn't leave a digital fingerprint.

58
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,433
Oh, there isn't enough chamomile tea
in the world...

59
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,160
...to quell the rage in my heart.

60
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,239
I'm talking to an orc under the bridge
in Thunder Bluff...

61
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,153
...says if we pay him,
he'll help us track down your things.

62
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,231
-Can we trust him?
-I should say so.

63
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:48,028
He appears to be a member
of the Nigerian royal family.

64
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,839
Whoa, somebody's auctioning off
ajeweled ostrich bridle.

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,274
No, Glenn's was leather.

66
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,431
He was a simple ostrich.

67
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,068
ls. ls. I haven't given up hope.

68
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,353
-Hey.
-Hey, Penny.

69
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,478
-We're in the middle of a crisis here.
-Oh, I know. Bernadette told me.

70
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:10,517
I'm sorry, Sheldon,
I know that game meant a lot to you.

71
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,313
That game?

72
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,236
Excuse me, Penny,
but "Doodle Jump" is a game.

73
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,834
"Angry Birds" is a game.

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,949
"World of Warcraft" is a massively
multiplayer online role-playing....

75
00:04:25,119 --> 00:04:26,871
All right, technically it's a game.

76
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,870
Bad news.
The Nigerian prince may be a fraud.

77
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,554
Okay, I brought you a day-old
cheesecake to cheer you up.

78
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,192
Stale pastry is hollow succor
to a man who is bereft of ostrich.

79
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,997
-Just say thank you.
-I thought I just did.

80
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,476
All right, see you later.

81
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,869
-Oh, hello.
-Oh, hi.

82
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:52,628
l was just dropping off a cheesecake
to Sheldon.

83
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:54,869
He was robbed
of a bunch of imaginary crap...

84
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:57,269
...that's useful
in a make-believe place.

85
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,713
I don't know what that means.

86
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:02,234
Yeah, well, sadly, I do.

87
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:07,751
Did you know Priya took Leonard
Rollerblading at the beach?

88
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,475
Can you believe that?

89
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,390
I feel like I'm supposed to say
"that bitch"...

90
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,755
...but I don't have
enough information.

91
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:19,588
lam the one who spent two years
trying to get him to go to the beach.

92
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,513
He was so phobic about stepping
on medical waste, I had to carry him.

93
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,112
I took Howard to the beach once.

94
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,511
He almost burst into flames
like a vampire.

95
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,876
What's the thanks I get
for turning Leonard...

96
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,631
...into quality boyfriend material?

97
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:36,790
l have to tiptoe
around his new girlfriend.

98
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,359
I think you're on.

99
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:42,234
That bitch.

100
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:46,039
You want some coffee liqueur
on your ice cream?

101
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,237
Here's the alcohol and drug peer
pressure mother warned me about.

102
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:53,033
l was starting to think
it was never gonna happen.

103
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,150
Yes, please.

104
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,275
Should've seen Leonard when we met.
No eye contact.

105
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,716
He was either looking up at the ceiling
or down at his shoes.

106
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:02,868
I'm drunk.

107
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,389
For the first months
whenever I'd take off my bra...

108
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,235
...he would giggle and say,
"Oh, boy, my breast friends."

109
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,078
If it makes you feel better,
I'm never speaking to Priya again.

110
00:06:17,239 --> 00:06:19,673
No, don't do that.
No reason to be mean to her.

111
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:24,797
This may be the alcohol talking,
but I believe there is.

112
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:27,678
Are you familiar with the study
of Tanzanian chimpanzees...

113
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,672
...by Nishida and Hosaka
out of Kyoto University?

114
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:33,751
No, but I can name
all the Kardashians.

115
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,829
Primates such as ourselves
have a natural instinct...

116
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:39,274
...to ostracize ill-mannered
members of the troop.

117
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:41,475
Bernadette's urge to shun, scowl...

118
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:45,109
...or fling her waste at Priya
is hardwired into her DNA.

119
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,912
I don't have an urge
to fling my waste.

120
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:51,752
Believe me, it's there. We all have it.

121
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:54,029
Hit me with some more booze
and I'll show you.

122
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,829
All right, here we are.

123
00:06:57,999 --> 00:07:01,435
This is the tavern where all the
black market weapon trades go down.

124
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:04,792
I don't think my character
should be in a place like this.

125
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,871
Everyone's undressing her
with their eyes.

126
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:10,876
Maybe if you stop dropping your
sword and bending over to pick it up.

127
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,995
-What exactly are we looking for?
-Redheaded troll, name of Glumly.

128
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,549
According to this,
if you wanna move stolen goods...

129
00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:21,187
...and it's after school hours,
he's your guy.

130
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,750
Is this going to take much longer? We
were gonna spend some time together.

131
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:26,113
We are. In the meantime...

132
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,840
...you're welcome to whip up
a character and join us.

133
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,998
Seriously?

134
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,675
Well, you have to put in
a credit card number, but it's fun.

135
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,474
Maybe I should just go home.

136
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,597
-Our troll walked in. I got him.
-We got him. We're almost done.

137
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,792
How do you guys wanna play this?

138
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:45,634
Be ruthless. Tell him if he doesn't start
talking, we'll register a complaint...

139
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,108
...with his Internet service provider.

140
00:07:48,679 --> 00:07:51,512
Sheldon, what if he gets his Internet
from his cable company?

141
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:55,718
He could lose his HBO and all
their delightful original programming.

142
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,438
I don't care. I'm losing it, man.

143
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:03,149
Why don't we play this smart?
Try a little good goblin, bad goblin.

144
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,151
Oh, dear Lord.

145
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,072
No, I think we have to be more subtle.

146
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:10,276
Okay, I see where this is going.

147
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:12,430
Fine, I'll have sex with him.

148
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:17,510
That's not where it was going.

149
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,273
Good, because I would hate that.

150
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,756
Leonard, you're busy,
let's talk tomorrow.

151
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:26,955
Oh, wait, hang on. Are you upset?

152
00:08:27,119 --> 00:08:30,236
No, no, I think it's sexy
to date a boy trapped in a man's body.

153
00:08:31,559 --> 00:08:34,119
Good, good.
I'll tell you what happens.

154
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:38,348
People think I don't get sarcasm.

155
00:08:42,199 --> 00:08:44,235
Well,well,well.

156
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,955
Look who it is.

157
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,997
-Okay. Be nice.
-Hello.

158
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,478
-We're just heading out for a drink.
-Because I do that now.

159
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,633
Count your blessings
you're not a Tanzanian chimp.

160
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,718
-What?
-Don't listen to her.

161
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:02,471
She's had a lot of ice cream.

162
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,589
Do you wannajoin us?

163
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:06,875
Oh, thank you, but I have work to do.

164
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,874
Four women walk down the stairs.
How many reach the lobby?

165
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,639
Did your sister say anything
when you got home last night?

166
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,110
Don't put me in the middle of this.
I'm not going to be your go-between.

167
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,998
Come on, help me out.
Am I in trouble?

168
00:09:27,999 --> 00:09:30,593
-There's no reason to worry.
