00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,479
My new book, The Hidden Reality,
takes on a grand question:

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,518
Is our universe the only universe?

3
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:13,751
You see, there's a growing belief
among scientists like me...

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,117
...that ours may only be one
among many universes...

5
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,190
...populating a gigantic cosmos.

6
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:21,909
In The Hidden Reality,
I explore this possibility...

7
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:24,991
...without presuming any knowledge
of mathematics or physics...

8
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,593
...on the part of the reader.

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,916
Hysterical.

10
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,351
I'm glad you talked me into this.

11
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,195
We work so hard, sometimes it's nice
to goof off and do something silly.

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,429
Agreed.

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,797
Wait till you hear how he dumbs down
Werner Heisenberg for the crowd.

14
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:42,712
You may actually believe
you're in a comedy club.

15
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,598
You can think about Heisenberg's
uncertainty principle...

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,309
...much like the special order menu
that you find in Chinese restaurants...

17
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:52,789
...where you have dishes in column A
and other dishes in column B...

18
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,871
...and if you order the dish
in column A...

19
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,951
...you can't order the dish
in column B.

20
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,475
That's sort of like
the uncertainly principle.

21

Ba-rum-bum.

22
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,318
Say, I heard an interesting tidbit
about Howard and Bernadette.

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,432
Really, Amy? Gossip?

24
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:11,032
I'm disappointed in you.

25
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,079
Now, now. Evolutionary biologist
Robin Dunbar has identified gossip...

26
00:01:15,279 --> 00:01:17,474
...as an aid to social bonding
in large groups.

27
00:01:17,919 --> 00:01:21,150
Forgive my language, but poppycock.

28
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:24,038
What if he's right?
And by not participating in gossip...

29
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,510
...society breaks down into feral bands
of tattooed motorcycle riders...

30
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,274
...fighting to the death
over a few cans of tuna fish?

31
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,398
Fine. In the parlance
of the urban music scene:

32
00:01:33,559 --> 00:01:35,914
"What's the 411"?

33
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,359
Bernadette is thinking
about breaking up with Howard.

34
00:01:39,839 --> 00:01:42,558
I believe our nation's
tuna cans are safe.

Yes?

37

You've dedicated your life's work
to educating the general populace...

38

...about complex scientific ideas.

39
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,949
Yes, in part.

40
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,311
Have you ever considered
trying to do something useful?

41
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,114
Perhaps reading to the elderly?

42

Excuse me?

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,992
Yeah, but not your books.
Something they might enjoy.

-Nice shot.
-Thank you.

My father taught me archery
as a child.

-Ooh. What do you think you're doing?
-Shooting a target?

51
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,756
-With what?
-An arrow.

52
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,275
Really? I didn't see you draw one
from your quiver.

That was uncalled for,
but I'll play along. Ow.

58
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,873
I had an unusual experience
with Amy last night.

59

Really? How could you tell?

60

She was attempting
to engage me in gossip.

-You don't say.
-Yes.

62
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,713
I think prolonged exposure
to Penny...

63
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,519
...has turned her into
a bit of a Gabby Gertie.

64
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,314
So, what's the gossip?

65
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,357
Oh, please, I was just pointing it out.

Oh, that's too bad.
I wonder what happened.

71
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:17,957
Hard to say. I can only speculate...

72
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,237
...based on data I collected watching
my parents' marriage implode.

PRIYA: Sure.

170
00:09:16,319 --> 00:09:17,911
You should have
kept your mouth shut.

171
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,559
Fair enough.

172
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,915
Now, what's up with clarinet--
Bernadette?

173
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,154
I've been thinking
about Dr. Greene's efforts...

174
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,675
...to make science palatable
for the masses.

175
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,876
Oh, yeah? What about it?

176
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:36,599
That's all.
I've just been thinking about it.

177
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,118
Now I'm thinking
about fractal equations.

178
00:09:42,479 --> 00:09:46,233
Now I'm thinking about the origin
of the phrase "train of thought."

179
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:49,268
Now I'm thinking about trains.

180
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,911
Are you listening to this guy?

181
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:55,639
Hmm? Oh, I'm sorry.
I was somewhere else.

182
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,916
Lucky bastard.

183
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:02,513
Now, I'm thinking about Jell-O.

184
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:06,789
-So, what's up?
-lt's a Bernadette thing.

185
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,951
Oh, no. I hope everything's okay.

186
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,551
Whatever it is, we're here for you.

187
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:17,550
You can tell us anything.

188
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,915
Yeah. Good or devastating.

189
00:10:21,999 --> 00:10:24,513
-l'm gonna ask her to marry me.
-Marry you?

190
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,795
-What?
-Yeah.

191
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,031
I just need to figure out the right time
to pop the question.

192
00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:31,997
-Oh, I'd wait.
-No rush, no rush.

193
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,673
[CELL PHONE CHIMING]

194
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,990
Oh, great.
It's my cousin David about the ring.

195
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,991
Hey, David, what did you find?

196
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,674
Sure, half a carat's fine.

197
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:43,512
Her freakishly small hands
make anything look big.

198
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,519
It's one of the reasons I love her.

199
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,435
Man, he's gonna be blindsided.

200
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:55,995
I know. It'll be awful.

201
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,793
Why are you smiling?

202
00:11:00,439 --> 00:11:01,952
Yeah, Raj, why?

203
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,439
Uh-- A smile means something
different in my country.

204
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,388
You know, tears ofjoy,
smile of sadness.

205
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,312
India's a goofy place.

206
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,679
Oh, I'm back to trains.

207
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:19,629
Woo-woo!

208
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:26,667
Did I tell you our lab got a grant
to study addiction?

209
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,637
-No.
-Fascinating work.

210
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,156
I recently trained a capuchin monkey
to smoke cigarettes.

211
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,999
Have you learned anything?

212
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,358
Yes. He looks much cooler
than the non-smoking monkeys.

213
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,119
It's not much of a contest.

214
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:42,998
The other monkeys just sit around
and masturbate.

215
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:51,435
If you don't mind, I'd like to stop
listening to you and start talking.

216
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,148
By all means.

217
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,473
Howard has announced his intention
to propose marriage to Bernadette.

218
00:11:57,959 --> 00:11:58,994
I don't understand.

219
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:01,957
The original piece of gossip
indicated an impending breakup.

220
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,476
I know. The group consensus is
that his proposal will be met...

221
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:09,029
...with a humiliating,
soul-crushing rejection.

222
00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:11,588
Everyone was set atwitter.

223
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:15,148
Although, oddly, no one tweeted.

224
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,389
It's not surprising that the story has
captured the attention of our friends.

225
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,156
-Are you familiar with meme theory?
-l'm familiar with everything, but go on.

226
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:29,076
Meme theory suggests that items
of gossip are like living things...

227
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,754
...that seek to reproduce
using humans as their host.

228
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,873
I'm no stranger
to memetic epidemiology.

229
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,598
At Johnson Elementary School...

230
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:41,196
...the phrase "Shelly Cooper's
a smelly pooper" spread like wildfire.

231
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,192
I should think so.

232
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,237
That's gold.

233
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:52,310
Your meme hypothesis
does intrigue me.

234
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,471
How might we examine this
more closely?

235
00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:58,191
Do you have any ethical qualms
regarding human experimentation?

236
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,951
It's one of the few forms of interaction
with people that I don't find repellent.

237
00:13:03,439 --> 00:13:06,317
We need to fabricate
a tantalizing piece of gossip.

238
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,837
And a second non-tantalizing piece
to use as a control.

239
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:12,115
Track its progress
through our social group...

240
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:14,429
...interpret results
through academic prisms...

241
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,593
...of memetic theory, algebraic gossip
and epidemiology.

242
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:23,436
Look at you, getting me to engage
in the social sciences.

243
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,271
You're a vixen, Amy Farrah Fowler.

244
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,233
Oh, hey, Amy. What's up?

245
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,118
Sheldon and l engaged in intercourse.

246
00:13:37,319 --> 00:13:39,469
In other news, I'm thinking
of starting an herb garden.

247
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:41,277
Mum's the word. Gotta go.

248
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:48,111
Oh, hey, Raj,
what are you doing here?

249
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,752
I just felt like drinking alone
because I'm deep and dark.

250
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,279
Uh-huh. So Howard's not here?

251
00:13:56,439 --> 00:13:58,669
No. One of those times
when it's just you and me.

252
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,912
Like when we went to the movies
and waited outside the bathroom...

253
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,752
...while Howard threw up
Red Vines and cherry Coke.

254
00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:08,475
-Do you remember that?
-Yeah.

255
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,392
Me too. Good times.

256
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,197
Hey, 16 wants to order appetizers.

257
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,432
-Oh, thanks.
-This was nice.

258
00:14:20,999 --> 00:14:23,035
What are you doing?
Howard's your best friend.

259
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,633
That is his girlfriend.
Be ashamed of yourself.

260
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,918
l was when I came in, but it's amazing
what liquor does to guilt.

261
00:14:30,199 --> 00:14:31,268
What you might not know...

262
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,000
...is Bernadette is planning on
breaking up with Howard.

263
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,390
-I know. How do you know?
-My sister told me.

264
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,915
Oh, that gossipy bitch.

265
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,119
-No offense.
-None taken.

266
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,396
You should hear
how she talks about you.

267
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:48,958
Just because Howard and Bernadette
are having problems...

268
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,270
...does not mean
you should be sniffing around.

269
00:14:51,439 --> 00:14:54,112
What can I do?
I can't stop thinking about her.

270
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,635
All right, try thinking about this.

271
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,358
Sheldon and Amy had sex.

272
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,118
Shut your ass.

273
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,832
Yeah, it's true. Amy told me.

274
00:15:06,999 --> 00:15:08,671
How did that even happen?

275
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,230
Did they know that's what they
were doing when they were doing it?

276
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,556
I guess they just figured it out
at some point.

277
00:15:14,719 --> 00:15:19,395
Wow. I can't believe old smelly pooper
finally got laid.

278
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,239
-Hey.
-Hey.

279
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,356
Hope you're hungry.

280
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:29,875
Interesting. A friendly sentiment
in this country...

281
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,998
...cruel taunt in the Sudan.

282
00:15:34,439 --> 00:15:36,509
It's a lesson in context.

283
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,512
Will Amy be joining us for dinner?

284
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,954
Yes, I believe so.

285
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,394
Good, good.

286
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,279
Everything okay between you two?

287
00:15:49,719 --> 00:15:51,471
Yes.

288
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,989
Why do you ask?

289
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,032
No reason. I was just talking to Raj...

290
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:02,829
...and he mentioned
what a lovely glow she has these days.

291
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,040
Did he mean
as if she'd been out in the sun...

292
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:10,317
...tending an herb garden
without wearing a hat or sunblock?

293
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,556


294
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,109
That's not what he meant.

295
00:16:17,439 --> 00:16:19,475
Well, we may never know.

296
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:24,190
As my mother would say,
the Asians are an inscrutable folk.

297
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,796
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have work to do.

298
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,350
Yeah, you do. You dog, you.

299
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:39,677
Did you get that?

300
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,958
Every word. Our false gossip meme
appears to have reached node lambda.

301
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,917
This is moving faster
than we thought.

302
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,548
Agreed. Rate of gossip transmission
is proportional...

303
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,109
...to the number of nodes squared.

304
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,272
I must say, Amy, pretending
to have intercourse with you...

305
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,477
...is giving me a great deal
of satisfaction.

306
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,909
Slow down, Sheldon.
I'm not quite there yet.

307
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,554
-Pass the soy sauce.
HOWARD: Sure.

308
00:17:06,719 --> 00:17:09,472
Bernadette just asked
about my sexual encounter with you.

309
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,473
The meme
has reached full penetration.

310
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,313
Pun intended?

311
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:19,349
No. Happy accident.

312
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:22,837
This is remarkable.

313
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,797
Took less than 24 hours.

314
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,191
I should let you know that she asked
for details about our dalliance.

315
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:29,748
Interesting.

316
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,913
So it went beyond the mere fact
of coitus to a blow-by-blow, as it were.

317
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:38,357
Pun intended?

318
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,670
I'm sorry. What pun?

319
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:44,510
Not important.

320
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,711
I described your lovemaking
as aloof, but effective.

321
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,436
lwish you hadn't done that.

322
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,718
That's going to make me a chick
magnet, and I'm so busy as it is.

323
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,795
Hey, everybody, I got something
I wanna ask Bernadette...

324
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:04,554
...and I can't think of a better time
than when I'm with all my friends.

325
00:18:04,719 --> 00:18:07,836
Oh, hold on, Howard.
There's lots of better times.

326
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,514
Please, the man is talking.

327
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:14,388
Let him get it out,
and let the chips fall where they may.

328
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,194
Thank you.

329
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,398
Bernadette Maryann Rostenkowski....

330
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,390
Oh, God. What's happening?

331
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,393
I know things haven't been perfect
with us, and we've had our problems...

332
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,630
...but I just have to tell you...

333
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,029
-...from the moment In
-Howard, stop right here.

334
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:34,791
This is it.

335
00:18:36,719 --> 00:18:38,437
Yes.

336
00:18:39,239 --> 00:18:40,672
Yes, what?

337
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:42,672
Yes, I will marry you.

338
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:44,033
-You will?
-You will?

339
00:18:44,199 --> 00:18:45,234
Iwill.

340
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,189
-I will.
-Oh, I love you so much.

341
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,429
Oh, I love you too.

342
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:51,998
Congratulations.

343
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,519
Oh, it's so exciting.

345
00:18:58,119 --> 00:18:59,757
I wonder what changed her mind.

346
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,751
Perhaps your talk of my sexual
prowess renewed her faith in love.

347
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,514
As good an explanation as any.

348
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,078
That's great.

349
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:18,156
Oh, hey, Amy.
Bernadette just texted me.

350
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:19,672
Howard proposed?

351
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:22,558
Yes. Just stopped by
to let you know I'm getting orthotics.

352
00:19:22,719 --> 00:19:26,155
Also, I'm carrying Sheldon's baby.
Mum's the word.

353
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:33,628
You're pregnant?!

354
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,035
Wow, is there anything on there
about orthotics?

00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:06,830
