340
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,112
You've been in there a lot. You okay?

341
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:14,077
Yes. Are you writing a book?

342
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,514
Why are you getting upset?

343
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,954
I'm not upset. Maybe you're upset.

344
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,075
What's up with you?

345
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:25,268
Bernadette?

346
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,554
I can't do this anymore!

347
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,790
I'm a good girl.
I went to Catholic school.

348
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,629
Okay, well, it's getting late.
This was terrific.

349
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,677
You win. Ha, ha.

350
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,394
Bernie?

351
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:48,073
I think the word
you're looking for is "befuddled."

352
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,032
My catapult flings my bishop...

353
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,551
...to Howard's queen's gorilla two.

354
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:09,478
Nice. Okay, rook to transporter pad.

355
00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:13,508
And he comes out at...

356
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:17,398
...Leonard's queen's bishop
five-and-a-third.

357
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:19,470
Check on Leonard.

358
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,513
Hang on.

359
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:26,069
When is my pawn allowed
to use the golf cart?

360
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,228
When it's done charging.

361
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,072
Or you land on the time machine.

362
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,071
Obviously.

363
00:19:33,719 --> 00:19:35,471
Oh, oh....

364
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,996
Beekeeper to king 12.

365
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:43,675
l capture your pope
and release the swarm.

366
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,196
Checkmate on Sheldon.

367
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,036
I knew I should've given my pope
the jet pack.

368
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,190
Hey, I've got winners.

369
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,110
