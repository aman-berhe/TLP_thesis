Hey, do me a favor and take Table 7?

00:00:07,119 --> 00:00:10,475
You mean, the one with my 118-pound
rock-hard stud of a fiancé...

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,791
...who's prone to canker sores
and pinkeye?

4
00:00:13,959 --> 00:00:16,598
I prefer to look at it
as the one with my ex-boyfriend...

5
00:00:16,759 --> 00:00:21,594
...and his gorgeous, successful girlfriend
who makes me feel like a toothless Okie.

6
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,270
Do you want me
to spill hot soup on her?

7
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:28,396
Please, you're not that kind of person.

8
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:29,548
I know.

00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,236
But if she orders something low-fat,
I'll totally give her the full-fat version.

That's my water.

00:00:37,999 --> 00:00:39,876
-What?
-My water, you're drinking it.

12
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,395
Dear Lord.

13
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:45,912
-Have you been drinking it?
-Yes, it's my water.

14
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,631
Well, that's it then. I'm dead.

15

Here we go.

00:00:51,959 --> 00:00:54,189
I'm sorry,
do I need to connect the dots for you?

The backwash into this glass...

18
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:58,757
...is every pathogen that
calls your mouth "home sweet home."

19
00:00:58,919 --> 00:01:01,433
Not to mention
the visitors who arrive on the tongue...

Hey, that's my sister and my country
you're talking about.

...but I won't have you talking smack
about the other.

24
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,158
-You guys ready to order?
-Yes.

25
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,311
I'd like a seven-day course
of penicillin...

26
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,472
...some syrup of ipecac
to induce vomiting and a mint.

27
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,999
-I don't understand.
-He drank from Leonard's glass.

28
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,639
"He drank from Leonard's glass."

29
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:28,267
The words they'll be carving
into my tombstone.

30
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:31,512
-That's actually my napkin.
-Oh, this is a nightmare.

31
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:33,388
Where are you going?

32
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,835
To the bar
to sterilize my mouth with alcohol.

33
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,875

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,232

...one iced tea...

00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,310
...and a root beer for Priya.

37
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,870
-Is it diet?
-That's what you ordered.

38
00:02:16,999 --> 00:02:20,355
Thank you. Hey, have you and Howard
started planning your wedding yet?

39
00:02:20,559 --> 00:02:24,108
Yeah. We're thinking of having it
on a cliff overlooking the ocean.

40
00:02:24,279 --> 00:02:26,270
Nothing soothes those
pre-wedding jitters...

41
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:28,999
...like the thought of falling
and drowning.

42
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,309
What'd your mother say
when you told her?

43
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,040
He hasn't told her yet.
He's waiting for the right time.

into her eulogy.

45
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:41,353
Howard,
you've got to tell your mother.

46
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,115
Have you told your parents you're dating
this short glass of skimmed milk yet?

47
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,959
That's different.
First of all, we're not engaged...

48
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,715
...and second, Indian parents
are very protective of their children.

49
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:58,828
Right. Whereas Jewish mothers take
a casual la-di-da approach to their sons.

-Fine. Thank you for asking.

a get-to-know-you lunch at the deli.

and spit out her bones like an owl.

-A heart-attack-like event...
