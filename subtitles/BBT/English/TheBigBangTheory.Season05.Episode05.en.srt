1
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:09,997
It's from Game of Thrones.

2
00:00:10,159 --> 00:00:12,719
-What do you think?
-I don't know.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,348
If we're going to start
a fantasy sword collection--

4
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,111
And I've long thought we should.

5
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,475
--is this really the sword to start with?

6
00:00:20,639 --> 00:00:22,197
What did you have in mind?

7
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:26,272
Well, off the top of my head,
I'd have to go with Excalibur.

8
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:28,907
It gives you the right to rule England.

9
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,590
It would be a replica of a movie prop.

10
00:00:32,639 --> 00:00:33,628
Fair enough.

11
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:37,030
It would give you the right
to rule a replica of England.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,231
Well, they don't have an Excalibur here,
so, what do you want to do?

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,436
Ugh, tough decision.

14
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:45,869
There's no weaponry
from Lord of the Rings...

15
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,429
...forged in a Chinese sweatshop?

16
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:52,233
Mm-hm, just Bilbo Baggins'
sword over there.

17
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,429
Two grown men with a hobbit's dagger,
wouldn't we look silly?

18
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,278
-Okay, let's go for it.
LEONARD: Heh.

19

my little treasure.

20
00:01:02,839 --> 00:01:05,353
Yeah, pfft, it's okay, I guess.

21
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,112
Okay? It's magnificent.

22
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,713
Buh-buh-buh-buh.

23
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,159
What do you want for it?

24
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,151
Oh, it's hard to
put a price on something...

25
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,709
...that's a copy of something
that was on pay cable.

26
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:20,075
But for my friends, let's say 250.

27
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,073
-Ooh, that's pretty steep.
-lt's a limited edition.

28
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,391
They only made 8000 of these
bad boys.

29
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,791
Only 8000.
We're wasting precious time. Buy it.

30
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,558
Hang on. Can you do any better?

31

you the friends and family discount.

32

The friends and family discount.

33

We are honored and we will take it.

34

Slow down. Two hundred.

35
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,428
What are you doing?
250 is already a discounted price.

36
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,398
-Will you shut up?
-Tell you what, I'll go 235.

37
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,754
Nope. Maybe another time.

38
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,708
-Okay, 225, my final offer.
-Take it, take it.

39
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,595
-Two hundred.
-Man, you're killing me.

40

Killing you? I can't breathe.

41
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,911

Oh, no, we can't let him lose money,
Leonard. I'm so sorry.

43
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,629
Two ten and you throw in
the Iron Man helmet.

44
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,314
Are you crazy? That helmet's
signed by Robert Downey, Jr.

45
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,515
So?

46
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:16,593
If you're gonna question
the importance of a signature...

47
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:19,512
...on a plastic helmet from a movie
based on a comic book...

48
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,831
...then all of our lives
have no meaning.

49
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:31,429
-Okay, fine. Just the sword, 210.
-Thank you. I can eat meat this week.

51

-You want me to wrap it?
-No, it's okay.

54
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,319
I'm gonna stab my friend in the chest.

55
00:02:46,359 --> 00:02:48,270

-Ah, hey, Wil.

-lt's part of my sword collection.

-No.

Heh, I'm not surprised.

Here's the Batman six twelve...

61

...with the Jim Lee alternate cover
that you wanted.

62

-Oh, awesome. What do I owe you?
-Forty bucks.

63
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,518
-Good deal.
-Sucker.

64
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,353
He didn't even ask
for the friends and family discount.

65
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,478

and l was hoping you would stop by.

66
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,676
-Will there be girls there?
-Of course.

67

You accept an invitation to a party
at the home of my sworn enemy.

He tells everyone
we're going to be there.

74
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,033
And when we don't show,
he looks the fool. Fiendishly clever.

75

l was actually thinking about going.

76
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:50,273
And then declaring the party
a fiasco and storming out...

77

in front of his guests. Love it.

-Sheldon, can you grab me a water?
-Possibly.

82
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,840
-Can you or can't you?
-lt's not that simple, Leonard.

83

It never is, is it?

84
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,315
At this moment,
our relationship exists...

85
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:43,629
...in two mutually contradictory states.

86
00:04:43,799 --> 00:04:47,587
Until you either do not go
or go to Wil Wheaton's party...

87
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,876
...you are simultaneously
my friend and not my friend.

-...Schrodinger's cat is a thought--
-No, I didn't forget.

93

Um, there's this cat in a box
and until you open it...

94
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:17,196
...it's either dead or alive or both.

95
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:20,192
Although our cat got stuck
in my brother's camp trunk...

96
00:05:20,359 --> 00:05:24,238
...and we did not need to open it to know
there was all kinds of dead cat in there.

to go up with the telescope...

and guess who that someone is, heh.

Who's Muhammad Li?

108
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,308
Muhammad is the most
common first name in the world...

109

...Li, the most common surname.

110

that gave me a mathematical edge.

00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:11,279
Remember how we used to make these
things look like they were masturbating?

329
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:13,717
Brent Spiner, what have you done?

330
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,553
That was a mint-in-package
Wesley Crusher action figure.

331
00:19:16,719 --> 00:19:19,074
Signed by my close personal friend,
Wil Wheaton.

332
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,516
Sorry, Slim. I've got some Mr. Data dolls
in the trunk of my car.

333
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:24,158
You want me to sign one for you?

334
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:26,435
You've already signed something,
Brent Spiner.

335
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,908
Your name on my list.

336
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:33,958
From this moment on,
you are my mortal enemy.

337
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,714
Don't worry. It doesn't take up
a whole lot of your time.

338
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,831
Come on, buddy. Let's not waste
another second on this loser.

339
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,511
Love your house.

340
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:47,352
-Can we get autographed dolls?
-Sure.

341
00:19:48,439 --> 00:19:50,077
Twenty bucks.

342
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,198
Ten.

343
00:19:56,959 --> 00:19:58,472
-Eighteen.
-Twelve.

344
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,631
-Sixteen.
-Two for 30.

345
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,154
And you come to my birthday party.

346
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:07,758
Done.

347
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,631
