1
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,634
So, what kind of cruise is this
you're going on?

2
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:08,393
It's called
the Born Again Boat Ride.

3
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:13,434
Christian Quarterly gave it
their highest rating: five thorny crowns.

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,236
I do wish you'd come with me,
Sheldon.

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,676
Oh, well, Morn, ifl did,
it would be conclusive proof...

6
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:21,750
...that your God can work miracles.

7
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:26,075
You're missing out. It's gonna be
wall-to-wall fun. It's all themed.

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,071
There's Jonah-and-the-Whale
watching.

00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,596
All you can eat
Last Supper Buffet.

10
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:34,910
And my personal favorite,
Gunning with God.

11
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:38,318
What's Gunning with God?
I'm afraid to ask, heh.

12
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:40,470
Oh, it is a hoot and a half.

13
00:00:40,639 --> 00:00:43,028
You write your sins
on a clay pigeon...

14
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:47,351
...they fire them up in the air, and you
pulverize them with a 12-gauge shotgun...

15
00:00:47,519 --> 00:00:50,397
...full of our Lord's forgiveness.

16
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,715
Frankly, Mom, I'm encouraged to see
how advanced your group has become...

17
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,078
...willing to sail out into the ocean
without fear of falling off the edge.

18
00:00:59,839 --> 00:01:04,833
For example, if Shelly was aboard,
he'd write "smart mouth" on his pigeon.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,639
And then: Bam!

20
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,709
The Lord giveth
and the Lord bloweth away.

21
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,869
Well, Mom, according to my itinerary
for our weekend together...

22
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:17,917
-...the fun begins with fried chicken.
-Sounds delicious.

23
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:20,593
Good, because I got you everything
you need to make it.

24
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,312
You are in for a treat.

25
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,080
My mother's fried chicken
is why we had to buy my dad...

26
00:01:25,279 --> 00:01:27,349
...the extra large coffin.

27
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,633
Sheldon, she just got off the plane.
She doesn't wanna cook.

28
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,994
Of course she does.

29
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,627
Making me food is her way of saying
"I love you."

30
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,313
Making me food when too tired...

31
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,788
...is her way of saying
"I really love you."

32
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,269
I wouldn't mind going out
for a bite, Sheldon.

33
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,477
Won't that spoil our appetites
for the chicken you're gonna make?

34
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,358
All right.
We're going out. You like sushi?

35
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,999
There's a great place down the street.

36
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,472
I've never had it, but there's no harm
in trying something new.

37
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,949
There's a lot of harm
in trying something new.

38
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:57,957
That's why we test out drugs
and cosmetics on bunny rabbits.

39
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,270
Sheldon, you're talking
like a crazy person.

40
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,795
Actually, I had him tested as a child.

41
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,075
Doctor says he's fine.

42
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:09,314
-Told you.
-I do regret not following up...

43
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,868
...with that specialist in Houston.

[ALL GREETING IN JAPANESE]

45
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,750
Stop yelling.

46
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:42,917
I'm not happy about this.

47
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,832
What's the last thing
you were ever happy about?

48
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,678
The prospect of fried chicken.

49
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,111
This is exciting.

50
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,595
Back home, the diner
on Route 4 serves sushi...

51
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,797
...but it's just cut up fish sticks
and a side of Uncle Ben's.

52
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,716
They put it on the menu in those kung fu
letters, but that don't make it sushi.

53
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:07,278
Uh, "Kung fu letters"
might not be politically correct.

54
00:03:07,679 --> 00:03:10,557
Oh, I thought the one
we couldn't say was "ching chong."

55
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:13,910
Yeah, yeah, that too.

56
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,358
So, Shelly, what's up with you
and your friend Amy...

57
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,555
...if you don't mind
a mother prying a bit?

58
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:22,472
Well, there's actually big news
on the Amy front.

59
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,553
She's been studying the neurobiology
of addiction in lower animals.

60
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:30,234
She's this close to getting a starfish
hooked on cocaine.

61
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,630
You have any idea
what's going on with those two?

62
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:35,915
Hmm. It's kind of like
the Loch Ness monster.

63
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,192
Maybe there's something there,
maybe there isn't. We'll never know.

64
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,828
But sometimes it's fun to creep
yourself out thinking about it.

65
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,156
How are you doing
on the young lady front?

66
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,471
I hear you're in some sort
of a long-distance situation?

67
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,631
Uh. Yeah, it's Raj's sister.

68
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,471
It's kind of tough. She's in India.

69
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:59,199
Her parents aren't happy
she's dating someone white.

70
00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:01,031
Oh, that's a funny turn, isn't it?

71
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,113
Because you-- You never think about it
going the other way.

72
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:09,790
Well, you can't force things.

73
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:14,431
Figure out if you're in a relationship or if
you're just calling it one. Like they say:

74
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,115
"A cat can have kittens in the oven,
but that don't make them biscuits."

75
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,952
That reminds me of another saying:

76
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,318
"You can lead a chicken to Crisco,
but you can't make your mother fry it."

77
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,791
You pester me one more time
about chicken...

...I will put you over my knee
right here in this restaurant.

Mrs. Cooper,
what did you think of the sushi?

81
00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:46,592
Good. The only thing that would have
made it better, if it was cooked.

82
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,116
And if it was beef.

SHELDON:
I don't know.

Well, I couldn't find you guys

So nice to see you again.

Well, it's so nice to see you too. Heh.

that had the occasional alcohol problem.

are you trying to cover up...

with the fried chicken.

What do we do
when someone's hurting?

Offer them a hot beverage.

112
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,513
When they're drunk as a skunk,
what beverage do we offer?

113
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:34,550
Coffee.

out there, are you wearing this?

...about his Nobel Prize-winning
work in cosmology.

my mom's visit with your sushi...

194

Apology accepted.

195
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,833
Great. Now, you're gonna love
the Perlmutter lecture.

196

is older than 6000 years...

Then you are gonna stand there
all day.

and slide over there.

Oh, I so should have taken you
to Houston.

330
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,949
Does this mean
you're not going to sing "Soft Kitty"?

331
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:30,077
No, I will always sing you
"Soft Kitty."

Well, I know, but he means well.

Happy kitty, sleepy kitty--

What are you trying to pull, Mom?

339
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,358
From the top.

340
00:19:56,879 --> 00:19:59,598
