00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,628
Hi. Did Sheldon
change the Wi-Fi password again?

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,554
Uh, yeah, it's "Penny already eats
our food, she can pay for Wi-Fi."

4
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:15,596
No spaces.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,912
Okay. What makes you think you
can get me to stop using your Wi-Fi?

6
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:22,593
I believe that you're capable
of great change.

7
00:00:22,759 --> 00:00:26,195
Like, when I finally got you
to stop saying "Valentime's Day."

8
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,191
-Wanna hear something weird?
-Sure.

9
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,031
In the year 2000...

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,910
...Pope John Paul II was named
an honorary Harlem Globetrotter.

11
00:00:37,959 --> 00:00:40,075
What are you talking about?

12
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,117
You asked Penny if she wanted
to hear something weird.

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,555
Well, yeah, because I have
something weird to tell her.

14
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,870
Oh. I thought it was a game.

15
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,513
-What's yours?
-There's this guy, Jimmy Speckerman.

16
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,795
He used to torment me
in high school.

17
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:57,677
He sent me a message
through Facebook.

18
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:00,478
-He's in town and wants to have drinks.
-Okay, Penny.

19
00:01:00,639 --> 00:01:02,516
If it were a game,
here are your choices.

20
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,432
An e-mail from an old acquaintance...

21
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,070
...or the head of one of the largest
religious institutions in the world...

22
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,676
...slam-dunking
to "Sweet Georgia Brown." Pick.

23
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:16,718
Just do it,
because he's not gonna let it go.

24
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,758
-Basketball Pope.
-And that's how it's done.

25
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:23,108
What are you gonna do?

26
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,077
-Are you gonna see him?
-I don't know.

27
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,277
Is this the fellow who peed
in your Hawaiian Punch?

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,638
No, that was a different guy.

29
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,191
Was he the one who wedgied you
so hard your testicle reascended...

30
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,069
...and you spent your whole Christmas
break waiting for it to come back down?

31
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,351
No, that was a different different guy.

32
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:47,191
Was he the one who used your head
to open a nut?

33
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:50,750
-No.
-Oh, oh, oh.

34
00:01:50,919 --> 00:01:53,672
Was he the one
who made you eat your arm hair?

35
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:57,792
No, but actually,
that was this guy's sister.

36
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,959
-Well, what do you think he wants?
-I don't know.

37
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:02,916
The holidays
are just around the corner.

38
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:06,754
Maybe he wants to see if he can lodge
the other testicle up there.

39
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:08,757
I told you. That was a different guy.

40
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:13,238
Mm, that's too bad. Could've spent New
Year's Eve waiting for the ball to drop.

00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,195

42
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,950
It's 2 am. What are you doing up?

Nobel Prize acceptance ceremony
streaming live from Stockholm.

44
00:02:52,279 --> 00:02:55,874
Sure. Wanna see what all the scientists
are wearing this year.

45
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,272
Look at these men.

46
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,193
They've managed to win
the top science prize in the world...

47
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:04,157
...with no more understanding
of the quantum underpinnings...

48
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,391
...of the expansion of the early universe
than God gave a goose.

49
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,076
You should pay attention, Leonard.
Someday it's gonna be you up there.

50
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,879
-Thanks.
-So, what's got you up?

51
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,349
Did you have a bad clam?

52
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,440
-I didn't have clams.
-I don't watch you 24 hours a day.

53
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,477
I don't know what you do.

54
00:03:26,559 --> 00:03:29,756
It's this Jimmy Speckerman thing.
I can't decide ifl should agree...

55
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,389
...to see him or not. That might be
because the last time I ran into him...

56
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:36,278
...he made me floss
with my own shoelaces.

57
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:38,558
Wear loafers.

58
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,676
Look at Dr. Saul Perlmutter up there
clutching that Nobel Prize.

59
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,400
What's the matter, Saul?
Afraid someone's gonna steal it.

60
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,357
Like you stole Einstein's
cosmological constant?

61
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:54,231
You know what?
lam tired of living in fear of this guy.

62
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,107
I'm gonna go see him...

63
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:58,839
...and say the things
I should have said in high school.

64
00:03:58,999 --> 00:04:00,717
"Pick on someone your own size."

65
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,110
"No, you did not have sex
with my mother."

66
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,110
And, "Yes, I do know
why I'm hitting myself."

67
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:10,516
Oh. Now Perlmutter shaking
the king's hand.

68
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,638
Yeah. Check for your watch,
Gustaf, he might've lifted it.

69
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,919
I love this dress.

70
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,594
-How come I never see you wear it?
-Because when I wear it, it's a shirt.

71
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,791
So, what's Howard doing tonight?

72
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:28,427
Oh, they all went with Leonard
to confront his childhood bully.

73
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:32,956
Oh. Terrific. High-school quarterback
against four mathletes.

74
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,519
When Leonard gets back,
I'd love to check serotonin levels.

75
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,240
Do you think he'd let me
draw a syringe full of his blood?

76
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,197
Hmm. He's not crazy about needles.

77
00:04:41,359 --> 00:04:45,034
But if you get him to go jogging,
it'll just pour out of his nose.

78
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,313
I don't think I can meet the girl
who was always mean to me.

79
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,312
Tammy Bodnick.
One time while I was in gym class...

80
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,758
...she stole all my clothes
and left an elf costume in my locker.

81
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,473
-Oh, that's awful.
-Worst part was it was too big.

82
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:06,271
That's nothing. In ninth grade,
the girls put Rogaine in my hand lotion.

83
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,274
Within six months,
the nicknames began to fly.

84
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,716
I think the one that hurt the most
was Gorilla Fingers Fowler.

85
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:16,872
Oh. Wow, you poor thing.

86
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,870
What about you?

87
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,031
Oh, I don't know. My school
was a nice place. We didn't have bullies.

88
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:25,874
Come on, no one ever gave anyone
mean nicknames, or picked on them...

89
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:30,715
...or put gum in their hairy knuckles
so the nurse had get it out?

90
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:32,358
No, we weren't really like that.

91
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,988
We played pranks on each other,
but it was never mean.

92
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,152
This girl, Kathy Geiger, got good grades
so we blindfolded her...

93
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:41,038
...tied her up
and left her in a cornfield overnight.

94
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,039
-God. That's awful.
-No, it was funny. Everyone laughed.

95
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:49,232
Did Kathy Geiger laugh?

96
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:53,631
Uh, probably. It's hard to say. She kind
of had an ear of corn in her mouth.

97
00:05:55,359 --> 00:05:56,394
Who would've thought.

98
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,597
Fuzzy Fingers Fowler
is best friends with a bully.

99
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:03,994
-What--? I was not a bully.
-Kind of sounds like you were.

100
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,878
And maybe a felon.

101
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:12,028
Shh. That's how you
wind up in a cornfield.

102
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,357
Is that him over there?

103
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,794


104
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:23,031
How about that guy?
He looks like he'd hate you.

105
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,112
-I can really do this by myself.
-We're here to support you.

106
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,319
No, you're not. You're here to see ifl
get my underwear pulled over my head.

107
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:32,790
You wore underwear?
Ha, ha. You fool.

108
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,554
-You figured out what you're gonna say?
-You bet.

109
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:41,598
lam going to make him apologize for
all the crap he pulled on me in school.

110
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:44,753
That's quite a list.
I can't read your handwriting.

111
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:45,954
What's that word?

112
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:48,317
Scrotum.

113
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,918
What's that one?

114
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,071
Uh, stapled.

115
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,758
Leonard?

[LAUGHING]

117
00:06:58,519 --> 00:07:01,750
-Oh, hi.
-Holy crap, man, it's good to see you.

118
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:03,432
Yeah, you too.

119
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,067
Uh, Jimmy, this is Sheldon, and Raj,
and Howard.

120
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,470
-Hi.
-Fellows. Can I get a beer?

121
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,154
Wow, look at you.
Little Leonard Hofstadter.

122
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,117
I hear you're a big-time scientist now.

123
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:15,349
And there's the first zinger. Ouch.

124
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:19,195
-l'm doing okay, I guess.
JIMMY: Okay?

125
00:07:19,359 --> 00:07:23,398
Come on, I read online you're a physicist
at a university. You won some medal.

126
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,835
-The Newcomb medal.
-Yeah. Congratulations.

127
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,991
Congratulations?
For the Newcomb med--?

128
00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:30,115
Oh, please.
That's the scientific equivalent...

129
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,748
...of a smiley-face sticker
on your homework.

130
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:36,313
-It sounded like a big deal.
-Oh, good Lord.

131
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,472
Are we gonna stand here and listen
to him tear Leonard apart like this?

132
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,517
-Hey, I won a Newcomb medal too.
-My point.

133
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,395
You should've seen this guy
back in the day. Huh?

134
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:49,356
He was so little,
he could fit anywhere.

135
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:51,396
Lockers, trash cans.

136
00:07:51,559 --> 00:07:54,312
Oh, man,
how did you get inside that backpack?

137
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,750
Oh, I can't take all the credit.
You helped a lot.

138
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,276
-We were practically a comedy team.
-Like the Black Death in Europe.

139
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,759
Jimmy, I'm kind of curious
why you wanted to see me.

140
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:11,638
Okay, here it is.
l have this great money-making idea.

141
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:13,994
I need a gear-head
to get it to the finish line.

142
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:18,471
Mm, technically, Howard's the gear-head.
Leonard's just a dime-store laser jockey.

143
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,867
What's the idea?

144
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,277
-This is just between us, right?
-Right.

145
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:26,991
Okay. What do you think about a pair of
glasses that makes any movie into 3D?

146
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:31,951
That sounds amazing.
First movie I'm watching, Annie.

147
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,115
How exactly
would these glasses work?

148
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:38,998
How the hell should I know?
That's whyl need a nerd.

149
00:08:40,079 --> 00:08:42,593
I don't think something
like that's even possible.

150
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:45,796
Aw, come on. You could figure it out.
You're, like, the smartest guy.

151
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,598
The smartest--? All right.

152
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:53,514
I may not have a firm grasp on sarcasm,
but, uh, even I know that was a doozy.

153
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,394
You can't live
in fear of this man forever.

154
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,358
-Sheldon, I got this.
-You clearly don't.

155
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,908
What my spineless friend
lacks the courage to say...

156
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,675
...is you're a terrible person
who took advantage of his tiny size...

157
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,799
...his uncoordinated nature,
and his congenital lack of masculinity.

158
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,189
-Sheldon.
-Leonard, l platonically love you, man.

159
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,873
But face it, you're a mess.

160
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,549
I don't understand.

161
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,435
I think what he's trying to say
is that maybe...

162
00:09:22,599 --> 00:09:24,829
...in high school,
