for dinner?

00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,996
Maybe Indian? Tex-Mex?

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,913
Ever wonder how humans would
be different if they evolved...

4
00:00:11,079 --> 00:00:13,798
...from lizards instead of mammals?

00:00:15,079 --> 00:00:17,832
LEONARD:
Okay, let's talk about that.

6
00:00:18,799 --> 00:00:21,188
As you know,
lizards, cold-blooded animals...

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,270
...lack the ability to sense temperature.

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,914
But they do move more sluggishly
when it's cold.

9
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:28,832
So lizard weathermen
would say things like:

10
00:00:28,999 --> 00:00:32,036
"Bring a sweater, it's slow outside."

00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:35,948

We all do. Now, how about dinner?

13
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,518
Oh, I would assume we'd enjoy insects
or smaller lizards.

14
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:47,837
We could also pull each other's tails off
and grill them. They'll just grow back.

The reason you're fixated on
