Hang on, Dr. C. What's vexillology?

8
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:34,990
Vexillology is the study of flags.

Cool.

-Did you have fun doing it?
-l'll say.

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,149
Fun and information
are two sides to this video podcast.

13
00:00:48,319 --> 00:00:52,597
Not unlike the only two-sided state flag:
Oregon.

In future episodes,
we'll answer some burning questions.

What's the only non-rectangular flag?

18
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,834
What animal appears most often
on flags?

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,151

on flags?

Now, today's episode of Fun with Flags
is not fun...

...but it is important.

27
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:35,188

you gotta know how to hold them...

28
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,590
...you gotta know how to fold them.

00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:40,916
Let's start by identifying
the parts of our flag.

-Excuse me. Sorry, excuse me.

It's Ferdinand T. Flag.

bring in some younger viewers.

It's brilliant. Let's take it from the top.

If we're gonna try dating again,
we should take things slow.

Oh, I can take it slow.

58
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:38,676
Did I tell you about my girlfriend
in high school, Karen Berberick?

To this day she doesn't know
we were going out.

when I broke things off.

Okay, well, maybe not that slow.

62
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,193
How about this:

63
00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:54,874
Are you familiar with the typical
development for computer software?

64
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,429
You know, just for fun,
let's say I'm not.

65
00:03:57,999 --> 00:04:01,071
Before an application is released,
they give it a trial run.

66
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:02,718
We could do that.

67
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,951
And if we hit a rough spot,
instead of getting mad, we say:

68
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,113
"Hey, we found a bug"
and report it, so it can be fixed.

69
00:04:10,559 --> 00:04:12,117
You mean like a beta test?

70
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,270
Technically,
this would be an alpha test.

71
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,476
A beta test requires people that
weren't involved in the develop--

72
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,358
Seriously? Do I not get credit
for knowing beta test?

73
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,312
No, you should. Absolutely.
That was me being pedantic.

74
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,517
And that's our first bug.

75
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,317

were identical by coincidence.
