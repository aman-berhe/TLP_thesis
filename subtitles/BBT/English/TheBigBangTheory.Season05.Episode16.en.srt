Maybe, uh, splicing some genes.

-No.

337
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,236
-That the soap was so--
-Sheldon.

338
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,548
Fine.

339
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,518
Sorry.

340
00:18:20,479 --> 00:18:22,151
You're forgiven.

341
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,639
Now, if you wanna stay...

342
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:26,950
...get started on those beakers.
They're still dirty from yesterday.

343
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,198
Next year, I'm going to Epcot.

344
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:40,997
Are you mad at me?

345
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:42,831
No. I'm not mad at you.

346
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:45,559
I just wish you would've come to me...

347
00:18:45,719 --> 00:18:49,075
...so I didn't have to hear it
through the nerd-vine.

348
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,315
So, what are we gonna do?

349
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:57,229
-You really want me to sign a prenup?
-I don't know.

350
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,470
My dad's pretty insistent on it,
though.

351
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,517
Why don't I talk to your dad?

352
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,590
-Man to man.
-Really?

353
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:06,637
-Oh, that'd be so great. Heh.
-Done.

354
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:11,428
I should probably give you a heads up
about a couple things.

355
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:15,832
Even though he's retired from
the police force, he still carries his gun.

356
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:19,716
But don't worry, he won't shoot it.
It's more of a fashion statement.

357
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:22,877
Okay, heh.

358
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,234
And just to be safe,
when you talk to him...

359
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,789
...don't bring up Jimmy Carter,
gardeners...

360
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:31,156
...foreign people, homosexuals,
Sean Penn, Vatican II, gun control...

361
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:33,389
...organic food,
the designated hitter rule...

362
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:35,834
...recycling
or the fact that you're Jewish.

363
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:42,507
Got it, got it.
Will you e-mail me that list, heh?

364
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,194
So the thing to watch for,
if he's shouting at you, you're okay.

365
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:49,111
But if he starts to get real quiet...

366
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:52,828
...leave as quickly as you can
without making eye contact.

367
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,275
Not in a straight line,
throw some zigs and zags in there.

368
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,629
[SIGHS]

369
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,597
You know, this isn't that pressing.

370
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,035
Why don't I talk to him about it
in May, heh?

371
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,630
In May you're gonna be on
the International Space Station.

372
00:20:07,879 --> 00:20:09,710
They got a phone.

373
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:36,830
