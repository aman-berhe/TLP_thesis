00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,158
I'm gonna run to the store.
I'll pick you up when you're done.

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:10,709
Okay. I like it a little better
when you stay, but all right.

-Hey, Sheldon.
-Hello.

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,955
I'm here for my haircut
with Mr. D'Onofrio.

5
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:17,952
I'm sorry, Uncle Tony is in the hospital.
He's pretty sick.

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,717
Oh, dear, Mr. D'Onofrio's
in the hospital.

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,872
Why do these things
always happen to me?

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,634
-I can cut it for you.
-You're not Mr. D'Onofrio.

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,631
I get my hair cut by Mr. D'Onofrio.

You believe this guy?

00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:35,027
Excuse us for a second.

12
00:00:35,199 --> 00:00:37,508
Sheldon, it's okay, he can do it.
He's a barber.

13
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:40,193
He's not a barber, he's the nephew.

14
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:42,472
An example of the nepotism...

15
00:00:42,639 --> 00:00:44,789
...that runs rampant
in the barbering industry.

16
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:48,471
Besides Mr. D'Onofrio knows exactly
howl like my hair done...

17
00:00:48,639 --> 00:00:51,870
...because he has all my haircut records
from my barber in Texas.

18
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:53,953
What are you talking about?

19
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,271
When lfirst moved here, I was nervous
about finding a new barber...

20
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:00,988
...so my mother had all my haircut
records sent here to Mr. D'Onofrio.

21
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,433
There's no such thing
as haircut records.

22
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:09,395
-Yes, there are.
-Have you ever seen them?

23
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,915
No, but my mother assured me
they were sent here...

24
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,628
...and I'll bet you dollars to donuts
that this one doesn't have them.

25
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:16,868
Excuse me.

26
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:19,354
Do you have access
to my haircut records?

27
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,839
Your what?

28
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,033
To paraphrase T.S. Eliot,
this is the way the world ends.

29
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,158
Not with a bang but with a nephew.

30
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,995
Sheldon, you're a grown man,
he's a professional...

31
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,789
...and your haircut is number three
on that poster from 1946.

00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:38,159
-Just sit down and let him do it.
-Fine.

33
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,756
But if I come out of this
looking like a dork, it's on you.

34
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,835
-So my kid said the funniest thing today.
-Nope.

35
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:01,550
When you tell this story later,
the word we usually use is "quirky."

-Sure.

-You read it as 0800.
-It doesn't have an O in front of it.

I can't help it,
I feel like a teen heartthrob.

52
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:28,552
Sheldon, I used to cut my brother's hair.
I could do it.

changed the conversation...

to "Sheldon can't get a haircut"?

-It's pretty neat.

like it's gonna crash...

no matter how many times you throw up.

-You threw up?
-Yeah. And the craziest part is...

the throw-up kind of ﬂoats there.
