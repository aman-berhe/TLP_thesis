even though I don't have one anymore...

340
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,634
-...I hope you have fun playing with it.
-That's a lie?

341
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:01,198
-A big, fat whopper.
-Yeah.

342
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:04,995
I hope it breaks.

343
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:11,919
This is a treat. What brings you guys by?

344
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,079
Raj, Howie told me what's going on
with you and Lakshmi.

345
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:18,712
-You told her?
-I told everybody.

346
00:19:20,439 --> 00:19:23,317
We believe there's someone out there
who'll love you for you.

347
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:25,834
We kind of agreed to disagree on that one.

348
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:29,116
But we both think
you shouldn't marry this woman.

349
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:31,873
So while I'm waiting
for this mysterious perfect match...

350
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:35,190
...who may or may not exist,
I'm supposed to just be alone?

351
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,793
Not necessarily.

352
00:19:36,959 --> 00:19:41,111
I think we found someone for you
to cuddle with.

Oh, my goodness.

355
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,869
Aren't you the cutest little Yorkie ever?

356
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,558
-You got him for me?
-Her.

357
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,234
We thought you two would hit it off.

358
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,790
I think we already have.
Thank you guys so much.

359
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,997
Let's go see if you fit in my man-purse.
