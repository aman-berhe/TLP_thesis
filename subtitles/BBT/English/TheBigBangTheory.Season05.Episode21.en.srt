00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,678
So I got the craziest e-mail
this morning.

2
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:11,435
I don't mean to burst your bubble,
but penile-enlargement pills do not work.

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,637
Believe me, I know.

4
00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:18,552
The e-mail I got was from the office
of Stephen Hawking.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,073
-You're kidding.
-Why?

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,196
He's coming to the university
to lecture...

7
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:26,272
...and he's looking for an engineer to
maintain equipment on his wheelchair.

8
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:29,670
That's amazing.
You'll be like his pit crew.

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,791
A word of caution, I would not do
your Stephen Hawking impression...

10
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,632
...in front of him.

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,793
[MIMICS STEPHEN HAWKING]
You're right.

12
00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:40,108
[BOTH CHUCKLING]

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:44,475
[MIMICS STEPHEN HAWKING] I suppose
that could be considered offensive.

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,509
Oh, boy.
Oh, Sheldon's going to freak out.

15
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:49,351
Yeah, he worships Hawking.

16
00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:53,307
l was thinking about bringing him along,
so he can meet the great man.

17
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:56,039
-That's really nice of you, Howard.
-lt's no big deal.

18
00:00:56,199 --> 00:00:59,316
Boy, a restraining order
from Stephen Hawking.

19
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:02,109
It'll look so nice
next to the ones he's got...

20
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,714
...from Leonard Nimoy,
Carl Sagan and Stan Lee.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,072
Leonard, do you recall when I said
that l was going...

22
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,198
...to revolutionize understanding
of the Higgs boson particle...

23
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,750
...and you said, "Sheldon, it's 2 am.
Get out of my bedroom"?

24
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,511
Like it was 10 hours ago.
What about it?

25
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,193
Well, I believe I've done it.

26
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,396
I'm only saying "believe"
to sound modest...

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,710
...because, sweet Sam Houston,
I did it.

28
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,791
-Really?
-That's incredible. Oh, here.

29
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,235
-Break out the math.
-Oh, okay. Let me see this.

30
00:01:29,399 --> 00:01:33,870
All right, so this particle here
is the boson moving forward in time.

31
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:35,711
Now, I was thinking--

32
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,190
Howard, you go ahead and eat.
This isn't gonna make any sense to you.

33
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,474
Sheldon, I have a working understanding
of physics.

34
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,154
Yeah, good for you.
And don't stop working on it.

35
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,039
You still going to tell him...

36
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,031
-...about you-know-who?
-Yep.

37
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,589
-Still gonna introduce him?
-Not on your life.

38
00:02:19,279 --> 00:02:23,113
Please, please, please.
Let me meet Hawking.

39
00:02:23,279 --> 00:02:26,112
-I told you, no.
-But I said I'm sorry.

40
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:28,918
No, you said,
"Would it help ifl said 'l'm sorry'?"

41
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,718
Well, and you never answered me.

42
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:33,949
So who owes whom an apology now?

43
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:36,636
Sheldon, you're a condescending jerk.

44
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:39,916
Why on earth would I want
to do something nice for you?

45
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:42,035
To go to Jewish heaven?

46
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,359
Jews don't have heaven.

47
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,271
Well, then, to avoid Jewish hell?

48
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:49,555
Have you met my mother?
I live in Jewish hell.

49
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,592
Howard, please.
This is Stephen Hawking.

50
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,672
Perhaps my only intellectual equal.

51
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,878
You can't be serious.

52
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,519
Try to put yourself in my place.

53
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,319
Imagine you're the sole human being...

54
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,074
...living on a planet
populated with nothing but dogs.

55
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,551
And then it turns out
there's another human being.

56
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,835
Hang on.
Are you saying the rest of us are dogs?

57
00:03:16,999 --> 00:03:19,308
I can see you're gonna
take this the wrong way.

58
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,674
Let me try again.

59
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,831
Imagine
you're the sole human being...

60
00:03:22,999 --> 00:03:26,275
...living on a planet
populated with nothing but chimps.

61
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,474
Get out of my lab.

62
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:29,755
Oh, now,
they're so much smarter than dogs.

63
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,274
Have you seen them
on those little bicycles?

64
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:34,475
Get out!

65
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:37,390
-How about dolphins?
-Out!

66
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,908
So come on,
how was the first day with Hawking?

67
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:44,354
It was great. We talked about movies.

68
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:45,872
Oh.

69
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:49,317
-I showed him some card tricks.
-Oh.

70
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,630
He even let me read a couple pages
from his new book.

71
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,677
Oh....

72
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:57,798
Something got you down there,
bunky?

73
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:00,837
Howard, please, I'm begging you.

74
00:04:00,999 --> 00:04:04,116
Raj, you're our group historian.
Has Sheldon ever begged before?

75
00:04:04,279 --> 00:04:05,428
Three times.

76
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,751
He begged the Fox network
not to cancel Fireﬂy.

77
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,108
He begged the TNT network
to cancel Babylon 5.

78
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,393
And when he got food poisoning
at the Rose Bowl parade...

79
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,075
...he begged a deity he doesn't believe in
to end his life quickly.

80
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:25,157
Do you understand
how important Hawking is to me?

81
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:29,790
When I was 6 years old,
I dressed up as him for Halloween.

82
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:33,237
-You're kidding.
-No, sir.

83
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:36,709
No, I took my dad's desk chair,
attached a Speak & Spell to it...

84
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:40,155
...and made my sister push me up
and down the block to trick-or-treat.

85
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,198
Granted, most people thought I was
R2-D2, but still, I got a lot of candy.

86
00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:49,635
You don't seem to be understanding
the English word "no."

87
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,677
Maybe a different language will help.

88
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:58,392
Russian: Nyet. Chinese: bl‘l.
Japanese: iie. Klingon: qo'.

89
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,190
Binary coded ASCII:
0110111001101111.

90
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,196
-lt's actually 011011110--
-No!

91
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,675
I'm not asking for me.

92
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:14,228
I'm asking for Hawking.

93
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:18,595
Let me try gangster: Hells no.

94
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,593
Okay, look. How about this?

95
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,227
You just give him my paper
on the Higgs boson.

96
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,232
If he sees the breakthrough I've made,
he'll reach out to me.

97
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:31,913
-What if he doesn't?
-Yeah, he will. He's really smart.

98
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,192
That's an interesting idea.

99
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:39,271
Why don't you give me a minute
to talk it over with my friends?

100
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,509
-How?
-Walk away.

101
00:05:40,679 --> 00:05:42,237
Walking away!

102
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,597
You do realize
you own his ass right now.

103
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,636
I do.

104
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:57,596
You can make him
do anything you want.

105
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,229
Yeah, I know. I'm just trying to figure out
how much I wanna punish him.

106
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,548
Well, don't be too mean.

107
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,438
Hey, I'm thinking about making...

108
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:06,988
...freshly brewed iced tea
if anyone would like some.

109
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,993
-I wouldn't mind a glass.
-I wasn't talking to you.

110
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:15,197
Bring him to his bony knees.

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,149
Sheldon, come on back.

112
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:21,230
Yes, yes!

113
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:26,594
What did you decide?

114
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,352
I'll give your paper to Hawking.

115
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:31,555
Great. Thank you. Oh, that's terrific.

116
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:36,634
But in exchange,
I'd like you to do a few things for me.

117
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,357
What kinds of things?

118
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:42,910
Are you familiar
with the 12 labors of Hercules?

119
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,072
Of course.

120
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,389
You should be so lucky.

121
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:54,356
All right.
What would you like me to do first?

122
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:59,274
Well, I thought I'd start you off
by polishing my belt buckles.

123
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:03,591
By all means. Yeah, when l was a boy,
I would polish my Mee-Maw's silver.

124
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,196
And she would entertain me with stories
about growing up in Oklahoma.

125
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:08,394
Interesting woman.

126
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:12,552
You know, she once killed a prairie dog
with a gravy boat.

127
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,270
That's nice.

128
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,153
Whew. Heh.

129
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:27,069
That's a lot of belt buckles.

130
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:30,473
Funny thing is I only have one belt.

131
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,758
Anyway, I'll let you get started.

132
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,832
Oh, by the way, the little marks
that look like water spots...

133
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,514
...I tend to stand too close
to the urinal, so....

134
00:07:42,799 --> 00:07:46,155
What you're seeing there
is splash-back.

135
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:49,669
You make sissy on your belt buckles?

136
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,512
Mee-Maw's forks never had that.

137
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:59,388
Here is a black light to check them.
For your own peace of mind...

138
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,518
...you might not wanna shine that
around the rest of the room.

139
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:14,029
Sheldon, these look great.

140
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,794
I mean,
they're like magnificent little crowns...

141
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,554
...to hang
over my magnificent little jewels.

142
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,038
How did you get them so shiny?

143
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,509
Oh, I buffed them with Turtle Wax.

144
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:27,670
The man down at Pep Boys
says from now on...

145
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:30,637
...the urine should just bead up
and roll right off.

146
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:34,197
Way to go the extra mile.
Your Mee-Maw would be proud.

147
00:08:34,359 --> 00:08:36,793
My Mee-Maw
must never know of this.

148
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:39,549
Now will you give
Professor Hawking my paper?

149
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:41,875
Oh, my dear boy, no. Okay.

150
00:08:42,999 --> 00:08:48,596
Next, this is a sexy French maid
costume I bought for Bernadette.

151
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:50,477
I thought it might spice things up...

152
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:53,278
...and get her to dust my room
at the same time, heh...

153
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,113
...but I was wrong and really wrong.

154
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,119
You want me to return it for you?

[IN FRENCH ACCENT]
No, no, no, ma petite chérie.

156
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,231
What are you all staring at?

157
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,790
You ever seen a man try to get
a meeting with Stephen Hawking before?

158

[LAUGHING]

159
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,509
-Hey.
-Hello.

160
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,353
It's not Saturday night.
Why are you doing your laundry?

161
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:39,716
This is not my laundry.

00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:44,595
Wow, are these Amy's?
Kind of trashy. Good for her.

-Those are Howard's.
-Eww.

164

Why are you washing
Howard's man-panties?

165
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,548
Because if I don't, he won't give my paper
to Stephen Hawking.

-He's a famous physicist--
-Yeah.
