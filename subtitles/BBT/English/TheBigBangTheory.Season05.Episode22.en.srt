The conversation is sparkling.

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,958
Fine, I'll tell you.

5
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,272
A lichen is an organism made up
of two separate species, fungi and algae.

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,712
If you could merge with another species,
what species would you pick and why?

7
00:00:30,959 --> 00:00:33,029
Hint, there is a right answer.

8
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,914
None of you will get it.

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,990
Okay. Urn, I'd pick swan
because, uh, the resulting hybrid...

10
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:44,117
...would have the advanced
industrial civilization of a human...

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,397
...and the long, graceful neck
I've always dreamed of having.

12
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,436
Wrong. Leonard?

13
00:00:51,639 --> 00:00:54,836
Horse. But mostly just for the height.

14
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:57,714
A little bit for the genital girth.

15
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,231
Wrong. And let's keep it clean, shall we?

16
00:01:02,639 --> 00:01:05,472
Kangaroo. Uh, I'd be a kangajew...

17
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:09,913
...the first of my people
to dunk a basketball.

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,837
Also, instead ofjust living in your mother's

21
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,074
No. The best organism for human beings
to merge with is the lichen itself.

22
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,238
That way you'd be
human, fungus and algae.

23
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,872

24
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:30,597

I appreciate Beethoven.

28

growing out of a towering maple tree.

29

And no thank you expensive concessions
because as an algae...

30

-No, he didn't.

32
00:01:53,639 --> 00:01:57,917
Anyway, if it's okay with you, we should
talk about Howard's bachelor party.

33
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,317
Seems like a bit of a letdown
after our lichen conversation, but....

34
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,152
What do you know? You're half-swan.

35
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,317
I did some research on strippers.

36
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,675
One agency said
they can get us a great price...

37
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,116

and number of limbs.

-l'm not into that stuff anymore.
-Good. I'm proud of you.

You're the first of us to get married.
We have to do something special.

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,514
Germans have an interesting
pre-wedding custom--

45
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,790
It's probably not for me.

Anyway, it's a beautiful time of year.

49
00:02:50,999 --> 00:02:55,151

a tasting on board, and all the wildflowers...
