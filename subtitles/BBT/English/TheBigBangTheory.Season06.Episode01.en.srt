-I love this part!
-Me too!

00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:16,351
l have strongly mixed feelings.

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,397
So Howard's really in space?

7
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:24,915
The International Space Station,
250 miles that way. Heh.

8
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:27,752
Right now Howard
is staring down at our planet...

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,309
...like a tiny Jewish Greek god.

10
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,874
Zeus-owitz.

11
00:00:34,319 --> 00:00:37,550
I must admit,
I can't help but feel a twinge of envy.

12
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,472
He can look out the window...

13
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,269
...and see the majesty of the universe
unfolding before his eyes.

14
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,512
His dim, uncomprehending eyes.

15
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,471
It's like a cat in an airport carrying case.

16
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:56,275
You know,
it's not exactly glamorous up there.

17
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,750
The water the astronauts drink
is made from each other's recycled urine.

18
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,836
Must be nice.

19
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:05,149
Nobody wants anything
that comes out of me.

20
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,477
-I wonder what he's doing this very second.
-Conducting experiments in zero gravity.

21
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,148
Peering through his telescope
at the birth of the cosmos.

22
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,073

MRS. WOLOWITZ [OVER SPEAKER]:
Howard, can you hear me?

24
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,993
I can hear you without the phone!

25
00:01:28,919 --> 00:01:32,707
Don't be snippy.
I'm just excited to talk to my baby.

26
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,110
I'm excited to talk to you too.

27
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,229
So, what's this mishegas about you moving
out to go live with the little Polish girl?

28
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,599
How about calling her my wife? Heh.

29
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,030
Wives don't take boys from their mothers.

30
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,714
They do, that's why we marry them.

31
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,474
I just hope I'm not dead
from a broken heart before you get back.

32
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,952
Ma, please, everyone from NASA
is listening to this phone call.

00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,556
Good, they should know
what a horrible son you are.

34
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:05,831
Okay, Ma, great talking to you.
Gotta go.

AMY:
This is so exciting.

39
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,548
Soon my upper lip will be the same
fake-blond as my beautiful best friend.

Hey, this is my natural hair color.

41
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,639
Now.

42
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,836
So does Sheldon have anything special
planned for you tomorrow night?

43
00:03:00,999 --> 00:03:03,149
Yes. According to
the relationship agreement...

44
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,276
...on the anniversary of our first date...

45
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,159
...he must take me to a nice dinner,
ask about my day...

46
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,231
...and engage in casual physical contact...

47
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:13,357
...that a disinterested onlooker
might mistake for intimacy.

48
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:15,068
That's hot.

49
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,676
You kids better use protection.

50
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,269
-How long does this stay on?
-Just a couple minutes.

51
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,995
-You've really never done this before?
-Once in high school. But I dozed off...

52
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,878
...and woke up with second degree
chemical burns on my face.

53
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,397
Oh, my gosh, that's awful.
Did the other kids make fun of you?

54
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:35,357
No, I had a cover story.
I told everyone it was herpes.

55
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:41,118
-So how's everything with you and Leonard?
-I don't know. It's still kind of weird.

56
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:44,555
We haven't really recovered since
he proposed to me in the middle of sex.

57
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,915
Oh. Boo-hoo.

58
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,191
If Sheldon proposed to me during sex...

59
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:51,953
...my ovaries would grab onto him
and never let go.

60
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:01,155
Leonard, where do you stand
on the anthropic principle?

61
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,434
-lnteresting question. On the one hand--
-You don't even know what it is, do you?

62
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:08,395
The anthropic principle states...

63
00:04:08,559 --> 00:04:12,347
...that if we wish to explain
why our universe exists the way it does...

64
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:15,113
...the answer is that
it must have qualities...

65
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:17,509
...that allow intelligent creatures
to arise...

66
00:04:17,679 --> 00:04:19,590
...who are capable of asking the question.

67
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,956
As I am doing so eloquently right now.

68
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,830
I know what the anthropic principle is.

69
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:28,071
Of course.
I just explained it to you.

70
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:31,515
Now, where do you stand on it?

71
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,557
-Where do you stand on it?
-Strongly pro.

72
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,280
Then I believe that God
created the world in six days...

73
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,635
...and on the seventh
he made you to annoy me.

74
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,108
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

75
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:47,396

on the anthropic principle?

76
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,357
-l'm all for it.
-Thattaboy.

77
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:52,317
Why do you believe that he knows
what it is, and I don't?

78
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,833
Oh, Leonard...

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,436
...let's not take a saw to the branch
we're sitting on, shall we?

I heard about a spa...

81
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,515
...where you soak your feet
in a pool of fish...

82
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,317
...that eat the dead skin off them.

83
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,791
I don't need to tell you, in Los Angeles...

84
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,871
...sandal season is year round.

85
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:14,872
-Actually, I'm hanging out with Penny.
-Oh, okay.

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,552

on numerous occasions...

89
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,633
...the only sea creature
I would consider being eaten by...

90
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,673
...is the Kraken. Because the last words
I would hear are "release the Kraken."

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,832
Which is cool.

on your date night?

102
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,038
Oh, absolutely.

...to provide Amy with conversation
and casual physical contact.

that I can't outsource that to an Indian.

we're not gonna live with her.
