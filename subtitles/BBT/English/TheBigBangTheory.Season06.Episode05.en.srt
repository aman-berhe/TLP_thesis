00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,431
Hey, Stuart, I got you
a little souvenir from my trip to space.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,471
Wow, Howard, that's very nice of you.

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,757
Yeah, maybe. Open it first.

4
00:00:14,239 --> 00:00:16,309
It's my official NASA portrait.

00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:21,317
"To Stuart, your comic book store
is out of this world...

6
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:24,119
...just like the guy in this picture was."

7
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:27,193
For the record,
he also thinks that Walgreens...

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,920
...and the drycleaners
are out of this world.

9
00:00:30,079 --> 00:00:35,676
That's not true. At Walgreens l was "over
the moon" for their store-brand antacids.

10
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:38,993
I see you're getting ready
for your Halloween party.

11
00:00:39,199 --> 00:00:41,918
Yeah, it's my annual attempt
to meet women.

12
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,991
Ninth time's the charm.

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,558
Would you like me to help? I have a certain
je ne sais quoi when it comes to soirees.

14
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,996
Thanks, but I can't afford je ne sais quoi.

15
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,070
How much forjust quoi?

16
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:56,589
Don't worry about money,
I'll take care of it.

17
00:00:56,799 --> 00:00:58,198
-Really?
-Yeah, you'll love it.

18
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,949
Ain't no party like a Koothra-party.
Ha-ha-ha.

19
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,078
You know what wasn't a party?
That hotel in Kazakhstan...

20
00:01:05,279 --> 00:01:09,318
...they put you up in before the launch.
You'd think you'd get one porn channel.

21
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,671
Have you noticed Howard can take any topic
and use it to remind you he went to space?

22
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,076
Interesting hypothesis.

23
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,313
Let's apply the scientific method.
Perform an experiment.

24
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,198
Okay. Hey, Howard.

25
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,910
-Thoughts on where we should get dinner?
-Anywhere but the space station.

26
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,675
On a good day,
dinner was a bag full of meatloaf.

27
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:35,508
But, hey, you don't go there for the food,
you go there for the view.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,399
That's fascinating.

29
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:39,317
I'm gonna see ifl can duplicate it.

30
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,071
Howard, I've always thought the lemon
was an underrated fruit.

31
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,547
Care to weigh in?

32
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,793
Not really.

33
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,477
-Oh, well.
-People say the Soyuz capsule's a lemon....

34
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,553
Yeah, but, hey,
that baby got me to space and back.

35
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:30,548
Ladies' night at the Cheesecake Factory,
does it get any better than this?

36
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,318
I hope so.

37
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,915
Question: Do you think your husband's
fondness for turtle-necks...

38
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,351
...is an expression of longing
for his missing foreskin?

39
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:45,030
It's not getting any better.

[PHONE BEEPS]

41
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,510
Oh, it's Leonard.
He wants to go costume shopping later.

42
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,950
-I thought you liked Halloween.
-I do...

43
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,273
...he wants to go party at the comic store.
Lot of the guys there are kind of creepy.

44
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,989
-Like my husband?
-And my boyfriend?

45
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,991
I'm sorry, Amy, you were saying something
about Howard's foreskin?

46
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,198
Nice try, but you have to go to
that party because we're going.

47
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,994
I'm gonna go, it's just not my idea
of a good time.

48
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:15,798
Leonard does things he doesn't like
to make you happy.

49
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:19,396
Yeah, he's my boyfriend.
Isn't that, like, his job?

50
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:23,037
-Then what's yourjob?
-Letting him make me happy.

51
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,037
ljust think, in relationships,
you get back what you put in.

AMY:
That's not always true.

53
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,149
Last night I gave Sheldon
my best come-hither look...

54
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:36,432
...and he responded by explaining
how wheat came to be cultivated.

55
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,755
I guess I could probably try a little harder.

56
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,434
You could start
by taking an interest in his work.

57
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,557
-That's kind of a problem.
-Why?

58
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,910
Not really clear on what he does.

59
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,272
He's an experimental physicist.

60
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,869
Yeah, I'm not really clear
on what that means.

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,278
He takes hypotheses and designs protocols
to determine their accuracy.

62
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,869
Yeah, you're reallyjust making it worse.

63
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,871
What kind of tea would you like?

64
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,352
I think I'm going to try
green tea mixed with lemon zinger.

65
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,239
Two tea bags in one cup?

66
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,233
You're not at a rave.

67
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,071
So, listen, Sheldon, I was thinking...

68
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:23,229
...since this is our first Halloween
party as boyfriend and girlfriend...

69
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,512
...I thought it might be fun for us
to go in a couples' costume.

70
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,832
I couldn't agree more.

71
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,314
Really? I find that inconsistent
with everything I know about you.

72
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:39,400
Couples' costumes are one of
the few benefits of being in a relationship.

73
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:41,789
Now, imagine this:

74
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:44,667
You and I, entering Stuart's party...

75
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,112
...and all eyes turn to see America's
most beloved and glamorous couple:

76
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,512
-Yeah?
-R2-D2 and C-3PO.

77
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:56,798
Dibs on '3PO.

78
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,710
Sheldon, when I said couples' costume,
I meant, like, Romeo and Juliet...

79
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:04,671
...or Cinderella and Prince Charming.

80
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,479

from some silly movie I don't even like.

81
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,274
Okay.

82
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,917
I'm gonna let that slide because
I know you're hopped up on tea bags.

84
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:23,794

that we're both happy with?

85
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:31,229

and influential couples of the 20th century?

-I know, it's long overdue. What you doing?

Better not be building a robot girlfriend.

No. Although, Howard was making some
strides in that area until he met Bernadette.

-No.

-No, no, no, don't look in there.

-Is it a secret?
-No, it's a nitrogen laser.

-lt's actually pretty neat.
-Yeah?

...combined with laser based

Wow, that is amazing!

120
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:25,956

in string theory that...

-...the whole universe may be a hologram.
-What do you mean?

-Wow!
-Mm-hm.

124
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,874

...that what we all experience every day
in three dimensions...

at the farthest reaches of our cosmos.

-Really? Never?
-Nope.

but the extension cord wasn't long enough.

Before I forget, I'd like your opinion on the
menus I've prepared for the party.

140

The theme is "food that goes
bump in the night."

"Creature from

142
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:02,035
On "sesame seed Bunzillas."

143
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:06,755
"Night of the Living Garlic Bread"?

144
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,479
It's funny because bread sounds like dead.

145
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,519
I'm sorry,
but these are just ordinary foods...

146
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,075
...with the names bent into tortured puns.

147

are in no way Halloweeny.

00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:29,311

with my Draculoni and Cheese.

00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,476
Reminds me. I was thinking of wearing
my NASAjumpsuit as a costume...

152
00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:39,789
...butl realized everybody would be like:

00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,111
"Where's your costume?
Why are you wearing work clothes?"

00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,278
Hello, boys.

00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:50,911
What are you smiling at?

156
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,639
Nothing.

00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:56,916
-You know where there's a lot of nothing?
ALL: Space.

with gravity again.

159
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,273
Did I tell you about the night my retainer
floated out of my mouth into the airlock?

160
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:13,636
Yeah, you mentioned it once or twice.

161
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,430
So here we are.
