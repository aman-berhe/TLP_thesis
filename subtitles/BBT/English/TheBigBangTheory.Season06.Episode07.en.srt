00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,112
Hello, I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

2
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:09,954
Welcome to
Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun With Flags.

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,515
Before we get started...

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,195
...l'd like to announce the winner of our
"design your own flag" competition...

5
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:17,951
...but I can't.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:23,752
The only entry was from GameyGamer75,
I know that was a JPEG of your buttocks.

7
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:27,232
Now, this week,
we have a very special episode...

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,712
...where we explore the flags of the popular
entertainment franchise Star Trek.

9
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:35,668
And to help me, I'm pleased to introduce
Internet personality...

10
00:00:35,839 --> 00:00:38,478
...former star of
Star Trek: The Next Generation...

11
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:43,759
...and the only guy I know lucky enough
to be immortalized in one-sixteenth scale.

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,150
Set phasers to "fun"...

13
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,074
...for my friend Wil Wheaton.

14
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,554
-Hi, thanks for having me. Happy to be here.
AMY: Cut.

15
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,509
-What's wrong?
-Sorry, you were brilliant as always.

16
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:02,909
Wil, that was a little wooden.

17
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,430
-Wooden?
-Don't worry, it wasn't terrible.

18
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,149
Just this time,
try to say it the way people sound.

19
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,518
And action.

20
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,872
My friend Wil Wheaton.

21
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,270
Hi, thanks for having me.
I'm excited to be here.

22
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:22,638
-So, Wil, what do you have for us first?
-Well, this is an exciting one.

23
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,155
This is the flag
of the United Federation of Planets.

24
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,993
-Now, what's interesting about this flag--
AMY: Cut.

25
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,714
-What was wrong with that?
-lt's called Fun With Flags.

26
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,429
They're not at half-mast. Nobody died.
Let's try and keep it upbeat.

27
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,791
Um, no offense,
but I've been acting since I was a kid.

28
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,269
I can handle a web show
without a lot of direction.

29
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,509
SHELDON:
It's true.

30
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,514
In 1982 Wil played the voice
of Martin the mouse in The Secret ofNIMH.

31
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,438
You moved me.

32
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,719
You'll have to forgive me.

33
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,917
This is my first time directing.
I just want it to be good.

34
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,314
-So do I.
AMY: Great.

35
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,711
So this time, let's try more real boy,
less Pinocchio.

36
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,676
-And action.
-And cut.

37
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,910
You realize I'm doing this for free, right?

38
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,590
Yes, and so far,
we're still not getting our money's worth.

39
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,912
Let's try it again.

40
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,196
Everybody's having fun.

41
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,192
And action.

42
00:02:20,359 --> 00:02:21,951
So, Wil...

43
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,988
...what do you have for us first?

44
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,277
Well, this is an exciting one.

45
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,950
This is the flag
of the United Federation of Planets.

46
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,189
Cut.

47
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,910
Problem, first-time director?

48
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,795
None that I could see.

49
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,394
I saw a man who loved flags
almost as much as I do.

50
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:49,789
I got goose bumps.

51
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,997
-He was overacting on purpose.
-Really?

52
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,833
Oh, he reminded me
of a young William Shatner.

53
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,632
I'm really happy to do this for you...

54
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,110
...but not if she's gonna be a huge
pain in the ass the whole time.

55
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,108
Are you gonna let him speak to me
like that?

56
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:06,871
Well...

57
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,398
...you're my girlfriend,
and I don't want you to be upset.

58
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,316
Then again, Wil Wheaton's my friend,
and I don't want him to be upset.

59
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,198
Hmm....

60
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,679
This is a sticky wicket.

61
00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:21,633
What do you think?

62
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:24,476
Can I speak to you for a second?

63
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,311
I'll be right back.

64
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,277
Feel free to play with yourself.

65
00:03:34,999 --> 00:03:37,832
I don't care for your friend,
and he's being rude to me.

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,274
You need to ask him to leave.

67
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,113
Amy, I can't just ask Wil Wheaton to leave.

68
00:03:42,279 --> 00:03:43,871
He's a minor celebrity.

69
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:48,071
Once you explain who he is,
many people recognize him.

70
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,439
Fine, then maybe I should go.

71
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,671
Could you? That would solve everything.

72
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,155
You are the best.
I'll see you at dinner tonight?

73
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,278
Sure you wouldn't rather have dinner
with your friend Wil Wheaton?

74
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,430
Come to think of it, I would.

75
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,675
You, little lady, are on fire.

76
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:36,516
Every time we eat here, your mom refuses
to let me help with the dishes.

77
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,829
Don't take it personally.

78
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,834
She likes doing them by herself so she can
lick the plates with no one looking.

79
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:43,674
You ready to go?

80
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,913
Yeah, let me just grab a couple
of fresh turtlenecks.

81
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,516
I don't understand why you keep your stuff
here when there's room at home.

82
00:04:51,679 --> 00:04:52,873
What are you talking about?

83
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:57,078
All I have here is a few sweaters,
books, bank stuff...

84
00:04:57,239 --> 00:05:00,470
...computers, mail, collectibles, medicine
and my electric body groomer.

85
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:04,838
Ooh! There's my plaid dickey.

86
00:05:04,999 --> 00:05:09,629
Oh. Got this at the Goodwill store for 50 cents.
Can you believe it? Heh.

87
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,516
Fifty cents sounds right.

88
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,430
-Let's go.
-You know, it's kind of late.

89
00:05:17,599 --> 00:05:20,477
-Why don't we spend the night here?
-Because we don't live here.

90
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,118
-I know.
-Do you?

91
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,077
You said when you got back from space...

92
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,471
...you were gonna move into my apartment,
but half the time we stay here.

93
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:29,038
That's not true.

94
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,351
MRS. WOLOWITZ: Howard, I'm doing laundry!
You want me to put anything in for you?!

95
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:36,477
There's some underwear in the hamper!

96
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,592
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Oh, good, I got that new stain stick to try out!

97
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,716
Thank you.
I only put it on the list two weeks ago!

98
00:05:47,119 --> 00:05:48,837
Okay, I see what you're getting at.

99
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,152
How about this weekend,
I'll box up all my things...

100
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:56,628
...and move them to our place?

101
00:05:56,799 --> 00:05:58,073
Thank you.

102
00:05:58,239 --> 00:06:00,628
The lightsabers will look great
in the living room.

103
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:03,552
Or in the closet. We can decide later.

104
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,394
MRS. WOLOWITZ: Howard, help!
My hand's stuck in the garbage disposal!

105
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,394
Just let go of whatever piece of food
you're holding!

106
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,158
MRS. WOLOWITZ: Are you kidding?!
It's a perfectly good chicken leg!

107
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:22,317
Hey, look who's out after dark
like a big boy.

108
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,039
l was out raising heck
with Mr. Wil Wheaton.

109
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,875
Four hours more and we would have
closed down the HomeTown Buffet.

110
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,716
-I thought you had plans with Amy.
-Yeah, I did.

111
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,077
But then Wil called Amy a pain in the A-S-S.

112
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,112
She got huffy and left,
and then Wil and I headed out to dinner.

113
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,989
That place really did remind me
of my hometown.

114
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,549
Because there we also have
a HomeTown Buffet.

115
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,873
-Hold on. Wil and Amy had an argument?
-Yes, quite the kerfuffle.

116
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,669
-Then Amy got mad and left?
-Walked right out the door.

117
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:58,318
And you...?

118
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,040
Enjoyed a delightful dinner
at a reasonable price.

119
00:07:02,239 --> 00:07:06,630
The manager recognized Wil and let us sit
right next to the frozen-yogurt machine.

120
00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:08,027
Right next to it.

121
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:11,431
l was closer to it than I am to you right now.

122
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:17,149
-Buddy, I think Amy might be upset.
-Why's that?

123
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,710
Because your friend was rude to her
and then you went to dinner with him.

124
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:23,753
You're just repeating what I said.

125
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,672
It's like living
with a lactose-intolerant parrot.

126
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,598
Trust me. Call her.

127
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,314
Fine.

128
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,596
It's a shame you didn't go
to dinner with us...

129
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,797
...because the buffet you're about to enjoy
only serves humble pie...

130
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:40,473
...a dessert much less tasty
than frozen yogurt.

131
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,833
l was this close.

132
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,952
What?

133
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:48,874
You'll appreciate this.

134
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,600
Leonard has some ridiculous notion
that you're mad at me.

135
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,638
Tell him you're not mad at me.
Go ahead, set him straight.

136
00:07:54,799 --> 00:07:56,232
I'm mad at you, Sheldon.

137
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,559
Hmm....

138
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,312
Eat one of your Luna Bars.

139
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:05,435
Very often, when women think
they're angry, they're reallyjust hungry.

140
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,358
I'm not hungry.

141
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,430
Your friend insulted me
and you didn't do anything.

142
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,115
Precisely. I didn't do anything.

143
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,913
Now, does someone feel like checking
her emotional math?

144
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,988
Keep going, buddy. You're doing great.

145
00:08:22,679 --> 00:08:25,671
Sheldon, I'm your girlfriend
and you should have taken my side.

146
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,149
That's it. End of story. Good night.

147
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:35,114
Wow, Amy's mad and Leonard was right.

148
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,190
What a weird day.

149
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,994
Hey, sorry this took so long.
But you used to work here.

150
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,720
-You know how it is.
-Kitchen slammed again?

151
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:46,949
No, I'm a terrible waitress, remember?

152
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,870
So anything I can do
to help you move tomorrow?

153
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,113
Now that you mention it,
I was thinking tomorrow might not be great.

154
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:58,153
-What's your excuse this time?
-No excuse.

155
00:08:58,319 --> 00:08:59,877
It's just, you know, I'm Jewish...

156
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:03,748
...and technically, we're not supposed
to drive or carry anything on the Sabbath...

157
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,672
...so this one's on God.

158
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,793
That might be more convincing if you didn't
have a mouthful of bacon cheeseburger.

159
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,114
My religion's kind of loosey-goosey,
you know.

160
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:18,353
As long as you got your schmeckel
clipped and don't wear a cross, you're good.

161
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:21,592
Howie, you promised you'd move.

162
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:24,034
-And I will.
-Yeah, right.

163
00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:29,034
I'm not going to live in my mother's house
for the rest of my life. I'm not a child.

164
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:31,594
I've seen her burp you.

165
00:09:34,479 --> 00:09:35,514
She did not burp me.

166
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,752
She was patting me on the back
and I happened to burp.

167
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,429
Don't you have other tables
you should be waiting on?

168
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:45,908
Yeah, but I told you, I'm not good at myjob.

169
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,434
-Listen to me. He is never gonna leave.
-l'm starting to think you're right.

170
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,479
All right, I've had enough of this.
I'm a grown man. I have a successful career.

171
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:56,869
I mean, for the love of God,
I've been to space.

172
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,715
lwill move out when I'm ready, and I don't
need anyone badgering me into it.

173
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:03,754
Wow. Excuse me.

174
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,869
That was just for her benefit. I'll move
tomorrow. I love you. Don't leave me.

175
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,639
Amy?

176
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:16,152
Amy.

177
00:10:16,719 --> 00:10:18,357
Angry Amy?

178
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,275
What?

179
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:27,595
I've been thinking about what happened,
and I hope this gift will make things better.

180
00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:32,388
Star Trek DVDs?

181
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,834
Why would I want this?

182
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,754
First of all, you're welcome.

183
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,157
Furthermore, not being familiar
with Wil Wheaton's body of work...

184
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,199
...there was no way for you to know
you were being rude to a national treasure.

185
00:10:44,999 --> 00:10:47,877
Get ready for 130 hours of "I told you so."

186
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,995
Fine, I'll just tell you what happens.

187
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,672
Episode one, "Encounter at Farpoint."

188
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,875

The new Enterprise heads out
on its maiden voyage...

190
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,915
...to contact the Bandi people of Deneb IV.

191
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,390
Enter Wesley Crusher,
played by my buddy--

192
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,152
She's hooked.

193
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,789
Wow, an end of an era.

194
00:11:26,439 --> 00:11:29,829
Boy, if these walls could talk.

195
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:33,871
They'd say,
"Why does he touch himself so much?"

196
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:39,994
Yeah.

197
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,471
I can't believe
I'm not gonna live here anymore.

198
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:48,836
This has always been my bedroom.

199
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:52,435
Right here is where my mom
used to mark my height.

200
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,113
Oh, yeah.

00:11:54,280 --> 00:12:00,355
"Fifth grade, sixth grade,
seventh grade, eighth grade, ninth grade."

202
00:12:01,479 --> 00:12:04,516
Yeah, I remember when l was 5...

203
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,877
...hiding under this desk
with all my Halloween candy.

204
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,556
Had some Peanut M&M's...

205
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,635
...went into my first anaphylactic shock,
had to be rushed to the hospital...

206
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:19,394
...came home, celebrated with a Snickers,
went into my second anaphylactic shock.

207
00:12:21,439 --> 00:12:23,555
When did you figure out
you're allergic to nuts?

208
00:12:23,719 --> 00:12:25,471
Sometime around the third Almond Joy.

209
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,948
Okay, wanna start loading this stuff
into the truck?

210
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,917
Yeah, I guess.

211
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,468
Hey, would you do me a favor?
Go on ahead.

212
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,315
I just want one last moment alone
in my old room.

213
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,234
We're not standing outside by the U-Haul
while you fondle yourself.

[SCOFFS]

215
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,034
Fine, let's go.

216
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,199
Hey, what brings you in?

217
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:01,309
Penny, if you wouldn't mind,
I'd like to have a conversation about girls.

218
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:06,195
Had a feeling we'd have a talk like this
sooner or later.

219
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,955
Are you finally getting fuzz in weird places?

220
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:13,908
Penny, please, I'm on the horns
of a relationship dilemma.

221
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,754
And for the record, I had a full pubis of hair
by the time I was 19.

222
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,789
And for the record:

[MIMICS VOMITING]

224
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,478
-So, what are you drinking?
-Well, it's been a rough day.

225
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,711
I usually go chamomile tea,
but I don't think that's gonna cut it.

226
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,999
You could have a Long Island iced tea.

227
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,309
Will that calm my nerves?

228
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:42,230
It's calmed the pants off me a couple times.

229
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,633
-Sold.
-Oh.

230
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,867
So the heart you got from the wizard
giving you trouble?

231
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,032
The trouble isn't with me, Penny,
it's with your gender.

232
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,791
Someday scientists will discover...

233
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:59,033
...that second X chromosome contains
nothing but nonsense and twaddle.

234
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:01,231
Yeah, Amy told me what happened.

235
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:04,789
Look, just apologize. It'll warm her twaddle.

236
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,111
That's a Band-Aid at best.

237
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,589
The core problem is that Amy and Wil
do not like each other...

238
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,036
...which is baffling
because they're both crazy about me.

239
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:18,636
And I like them, which indicates
they're bright and interesting...

240
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,075
...andlor were on Star Trek.

241
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:23,995
Honey, you can't make people
like each other.

242
00:14:24,439 --> 00:14:27,397
Not true. Leonard made me like you.

243
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,630
Let me tell you, that was a hard row to hoe.

244
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,951
Cheers, pal.

245
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,432
Ooh!

246
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,718
Boy, that is a treat that's hard to beat.

247
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,198
Get the Mad Hatter on the horn.
I'm having a tea party.

248
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,112
You might wanna pace yourself.

249
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,112
I drink tea all the time.
I think I know what I'm doing.

250
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:59,151
Far be it for me
to criticize a man with a full pubis.

251
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:05,957
Look, your problem is not Wil Wheaton.
Your problem is the way you treated Amy.

252
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,429
Problem is I'm out of tea.

253
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:12,831
Come on, someone insulted your girlfriend,
you just let him do it?

254
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:15,559
Thought you Texas guys stood up
for your womenfolk.

255
00:15:15,719 --> 00:15:17,311
Oh, Penny, please.

256
00:15:17,479 --> 00:15:20,437
Think I've evolved
beyond my simple rustic upbringing.

257
00:15:20,599 --> 00:15:21,634
Sorry.

258
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,588
On the other hand, that low-down polecat
done wronged my woman.

Welcome to Long Island, Tex.

260
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,152
Amy deserves better.

261
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:36,594
You know,
when we buy the Planters Deluxe Mix...

262
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:39,910
...she eats all the Brazil nuts
so I don't have to look at them.

263
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,233
She's a unique blend of saint and squirrel.

264
00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:47,467
Yup, that she is. Here you go.

265
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:51,029
I'm a callous egomaniac.
She's gonna leave me.

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,111
-No, she won't.
-No, she won't. I'm great.

267
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:03,598
Ah!

268
00:16:04,999 --> 00:16:09,948
Okay, I have now officially moved out
of my mother's house.

269
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:13,556
You are now the only woman in my life
who I'll see naked in the bathroom.

270
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,034
I know this wasn't easy. You doing okay?

271
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,350
Well, I'm fine. It's just her I'm worried about.

272
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,916
-She'll be okay. She's a grown woman.
-I know.

273
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:28,948
It's just ever since my dad left,
I've felt responsible for her.

274
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,997
That's a lot for a kid to deal with.

275
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,799
She was just so sad all the time.

276
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:36,837
l was the only person
who could cheer her up.

277
00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:39,149
Well, me and Ben and Jerry.

278
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:42,475
She's lucky you were there.

279
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:47,391
You know, she's why I first got into magic.

280
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,152
I would do little shows for her.

281
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:54,269
Hang up a bedsheet like it was a curtain,
put on a top hat and cape.

282
00:16:54,439 --> 00:16:59,718
And partway through the act, I would say
I needed a volunteer from the audience...

283
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:05,636
...to be my beautiful assistant
and invite her up on-stage.

284
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:09,155
I can still remember the way she'd smile.

285
00:17:09,719 --> 00:17:14,156
For a few minutes,
she'd forget how lonely she was.

286
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,113
Aw, crap. Let's go.

287
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:21,467
Where are we going?

288
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,074
Grab a box.
We'll sleep at your mother's place tonight.

289
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,878
No, but I want to live here.

290
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:29,952
Well, you should've thought of that before
you told me the stupid magic-trick story.

291
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,391
Can't we talk about this?

292
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,472
No husband of mine
is gonna break his mother's heart.

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,758

00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:49,470
Wait, how many was that?

00:17:52,159 --> 00:17:56,232
-Hey, Sheldon, what's up?
-Wouldn't you like to know.

297
00:17:57,479 --> 00:18:00,551
-Have you been drinking?
-Just tea.

298
00:18:01,439 --> 00:18:04,112
It was the best tea I've ever had.

299
00:18:05,479 --> 00:18:06,753
Why are you here?

300
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,799
I'll tell you.

I'm from Texas.

302
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:13,914
Need I say more?

303
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,560
Yeah, actually,
a little more would be helpful.

304
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:22,111
You insulted my woman.
I'm here to defend her honor.

Oh, Sheldon,
do you really think we're gonna fight?

309
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:41,512
My fists are not up here
because I'm milking a giant invisible cow.

Okay, I'm sorry.

Well, that was a long bus ride
for not very much.

Are you okay?

00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,073
You're asking a lot of questions,
Wil Wheaton.

315
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,878
As a matter of idle curiosity...

316
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,555
...which of your shrubberies do you feel
would benefit from a thorough vomiting?

317

Welcome to
Sheldon Cooper Presents Fun With Flags.

Get ready for a very special episode...

324

...where we explore the flags of the popular
entertainment franchise Star Trek.

325

And to help us,
I'm pleased to introduce a special guest.

326
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,752
Surprisingly, it only took gas money and
the promise of free food to get him here.

but I'm obligated to agree with her.
