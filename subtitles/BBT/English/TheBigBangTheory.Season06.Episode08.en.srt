What are you drawing over there?

2
00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:10,278
A hypothetical containment field
for a Frisbee-sized wormhole...

3
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:12,999
...that could serve as a portal
to a parallel universe.

4
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,272
Oh, you silly doodlebug.

5
00:00:17,599 --> 00:00:20,511
A lot of scientists believe
making contact with other life-forms...

6
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:22,749
...would probably not end well for us.

7
00:00:22,959 --> 00:00:24,756
It's a Frisbee-sized wormhole, Leonard.

8
00:00:24,919 --> 00:00:27,069
You could block it with a Frisbee.
Calm down.

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,516
Do you expect me to build this? Heh.

10
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,797
I expect you to wipe the pudding
off your chin. Gentlemen.

11
00:00:37,639 --> 00:00:41,473
Have you guys ever noticed that Sheldon
always disappears every day at 2:45?

12
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:43,829
-Really?
-He probably just goes to the bathroom.

13
00:00:43,999 --> 00:00:46,672
Actually, no. He goes at 8 am.
with optional follow-ups...

14
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,594
...at 1:45 and 7:10 on high-fiber Fridays.

15
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,278
It's sad that you know that.

16
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,193
Oh....
That's just the tip of the sadness iceberg.

17
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,191
I'm looking at his public calendar.

18
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,157
Two-forty-five to 3:05, nothing.

19
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:05,469
Yesterday, 2:45 to 3:05, nothing.

20
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,148
Last week, nothing. Last month, nothing.

21
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,754
He never has anything booked
during that time.

22
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,633
Twenty minutes a day
completely unaccounted for.

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,310
-We should figure out where he goes.
-Ooh, this is exciting.

24
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,159
Like one of my classic
murder-mystery dinner parties.

25
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:26,269
Right, the case of who murdered
three Saturday nights of my life.

26
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:29,590
Colonel Koothrappali in the kitchen
with the olive spread.

27
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:33,991
It was tapenade and you guys suck.

28
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:00,948
So how was work today?

29
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,350
Well, I spent most of the afternoon
growing isotopically pure crystals...

30
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:06,430
...for neutrino detection.

31
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:10,070
That sounds like fun.

32
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,752
-Yeah, it was.
-Oh, good, I guessed right.

-Oh, just this guy I met at school.

35
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,119
Oh, great. We're still dating, right?

36
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,118
Relax, he's just a friend. We're doing
an oral report together. He's really nice.

37
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:29,476
I'm sorry, what was that?
I had a little stroke after "oral."

38
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,638
Would you stop?

He moved here from London.
He doesn't know anybody.

Oh, good, an English accent,
the sexiest accent you can have.

42
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:40,718
No, that's not true.

43
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,598
There's French, there's Italian.

44
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,955
No, you're right, it's the best.

45
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,320
-Did you tell him you have a boyfriend?
-It didn't come up.

46
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,959
Maybe you should tell him.

47
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,678
What am I supposed to say?

48
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,229
Say, "Can't talk right now.
Hanging with my boyfriend.

49
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,073
England sucks, you suck,
U.S.A. number one."

50
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:05,909
Fine. "Hanging with my boyfriend.
Talk to you later."

51
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:07,478
-Happy?
-Yes. Thank you.

-Nothing.

What?

57
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,075
"Did your boyfriend make you type that?"

58
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,915
I hate this guy.

00:03:32,999 --> 00:03:36,275
-Don't be like that.
-Oh, come on. Trust me, he's hitting on you.

00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,954
He's not, we're just friends.
Is this gonna be a problem?

61
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,315
He's supposed to come over

If it makes you uncomfortable, I'll switch
partners even though the thing's due...

...and everyone already has a partner

Hey, Sheldon.

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,758
Oh, hello.

69
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:05,912
Raj and l are heading over to the genetics
lab to pet the glow-in-the-dark bunny.

00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:08,637
-Wanna come with us?
-No, thank you.

71
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,475
You sure? They turn off the lights and it's
like a little laser show that poops all over.

72
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:15,837
I'm quite sure. Good day.

00:04:15,999 --> 00:04:17,910
-Where are you going?
-Where are you going?

74
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,718
-We told you.
-Yeah, ljust told you.

75
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:22,757
-No, you didn't.
-Your word against mine. See you in court.

76
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,588
-Should we follow him?
-I don't know. I'm torn.

77
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,196
I want to know where he's going but
now I kind of want to play with the bunny.

00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:35,874
-Hey, guys.
-Hey, Alex.

79
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:37,950
-Do you know where your boss just went?
-No.

80
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,554
-Don't you know his schedule?
-All I know is corduroy...

81
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:43,513
...makes too much noise
and l have to go find quieter pants.

00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,109
Come on.

83
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,637
Boy, what I wouldn't give
to get her out of those pants.

84
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,633
And into something a little more stylish.

85
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,191
This is where he goes?

86
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:14,873
-What's in there?
-I think it's an old storage room.

87
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,228
What could he be doing in there every day
for 20 minutes?

88
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,038
Well, he's not doing 20-minute abs...

89
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,872
...because if he were,
he'd have way better abs.

90
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,439
-Can you hear anything?
-Not yet.

91
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,310
What are you doing?

92
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,595
I'm listening.

93
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:49,671
Can't you face the other way and listen?

94
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:52,677
I can't do anything right for you, can I?

95
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:54,752
What the hell is he up to?

96
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,278
He is kind of a weirdo.

97
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,477
Maybe he's got Leonard Nimoy
chained up in there.

98
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,313
Or Bill Gates. Or Stephen Hawking.

99
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:06,917
Why would he chain up Stephen Hawking?

100
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,150
Howard, you can't treat the man differently
just because he's disabled. That's not okay.

101
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:18,589
If you're wondering why I've been staring...

102
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,797
...l'm trying to get a look at this guy
who's coming over to Penny's.

103
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,788
To be honest, I didn't know you were here.

104
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:29,268
It's not a big deal.
He's just in her history class.

105
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,034
They're working on a project.
I don't even know why I care.

106
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,556
-You know what, I don't care.
-You think you don't care.

107
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,993
This is silly. I have nothing to worry about.

108
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,276
Oh, I don't know.

109
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:47,188
Hey, statistically speaking, I'm sure
you have something to worry about.

110
00:06:48,359 --> 00:06:49,348
What do you mean?

111
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:53,432
Well, if we assume
that your looks are average...

112
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,115
...right off the bat, 50 percent of men on
Earth are more attractive than you.

113
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:04,873
That's 1.5 billion handsome lads
standing by, waiting to rain on your parade.

114
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,990
Well, yeah, but this isn'tjust about looks.

115
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,913
I'm way above average
in a lot of other things.

116
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:17,312
Not height, vision, athleticism,
or ability to digest dairy products.

117
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:21,794
I'm talking about important things
like emotional maturity.

118
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:25,508
You were just spying on your girlfriend
through a peephole.

119
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,518
I liked it better
when you thought I wasn't here.

120
00:07:29,719 --> 00:07:32,313
I'm not saying
you don't have attractive qualities.

121
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,914
Your choice of friends is impeccable.

122
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,478
You're a good sleeper.

123
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,797
And last but not least,
you buy the grapes I like.

124
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:45,789
You're a real catch compared
to some snoring guy...

125
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:48,712
...with a fridge full of lousy grapes.

126
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:50,908
None of this matters.

127
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:54,549
I trust that Penny cares about me
and nothing's gonna happen with this guy.

128
00:07:54,719 --> 00:07:57,756
Unless of course he's a skilled hypnotist.

129
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,355
What?

130
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,554
While unlikely,
it's still a statistical possibility.

131
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:08,589
She might be performing sexual acts
with him and not even know it.

132
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,874
-Now you're just being ridiculous.
-Am I?

133
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,713
The mind's a mysterious thing, Leonard.

134
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,757
He could be having the time of his life...

135
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,513
...while she thinks she's a chicken
pecking for corn.

136
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,917
Look at us, sneaking around in the middle
of the night like a couple of cat burglars.

137
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,199
I think we're more like ninjas.

138
00:08:39,359 --> 00:08:42,271
I don't wanna be a ninja.
I wanna be a cat burglar.

139
00:08:43,079 --> 00:08:47,470
-Fine. I'll be a ninja, you be a cat burglar.
-No, we both have to be the same thing.

140
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,035
Okay, we're ninjas.

141
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,437
Thank you.

142
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,354
But next time we'll be cat burglars.

-Are you sure?

144
00:09:04,999 --> 00:09:06,591
Yes, I'm sure.

145
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:09,148
Now, you stand guard, I'm--

146
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,952
It's locked.

147
00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:18,628
Just keep an eye out.
I'll have this open in a minute.

148
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,518
When did you learn how to pick locks?

149
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,990
When I was starting to do magic
in junior high...

150
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,277
...I thought I could be an escape artist
like Harry Houdini.

151
00:09:27,439 --> 00:09:29,157
-How did that work out?
-Pretty good.

152
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:34,234
I managed to escape friends, popularity,
and every party thrown in a 12-mile radius.

153
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,190
-There. Ready?
-Hold on, hold on.

154
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:38,388
What?

155
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,235
Sheldon is a very smart man, and
he obviously wants to keep this a secret.

156
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,878
Yeah, so?

157
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:46,758
What if it's booby-trapped?

158
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:49,639
Don't worry, I'm one step ahead of him.

159
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:52,074
Oh, great, what's your pl--?

160
00:09:56,999 --> 00:09:58,591
Are we good?

161
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,029
Yeah.

162
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:08,153
Huh.

163
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,070
Forty-th ree.

164
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,639
What the hell does that mean?

165
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:14,232
I don't know.

166
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,630
-The solution to an equation?
-Maybe.

167
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,552
