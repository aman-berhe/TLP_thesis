1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,159
-They are not.
-They are too.

2
00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:07,992
Your hypothesis is completely disconfirmed
by all the data.

3
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:10,872
You're just clinging to it
out of intellectual stubbornness.

4
00:00:11,079 --> 00:00:14,913
No, you're displaying a shocking ignorance
of the subject matter.

5
00:00:15,159 --> 00:00:18,037
Mummies and zombies
are the exact same thing.

6
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:20,668
Oh, yeah?

7
00:00:20,919 --> 00:00:22,511
Mummies are wrapped in bandages.

8
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:25,108
That's called a fashion choice.

9
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,993
All right. You brought this on yourself.

10
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,952
-Sheldon, get him.
-If a zombie bites you...

11
00:00:32,639 --> 00:00:33,913
...you turn into a zombie.

12
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,678
However, if a mummy bites you...

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,348
...all you turn into
is some schmo with a mummy bite.

14
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,870
So, like a zombie that's been eaten
from the waist down...

15
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,753
...you, sir, have no leg to stand on.

16
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:47,548
-Good boy. Here's a cookie.
-Oh, thank you.

17
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,836
Hey, fellas, what's going on?

18
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,553
Mummies and zombies again.

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,354
Ahh. They're not the same thing.

20
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,029
You get a cookie too.

21
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,115
Thanks.

22
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:01,112
Guess who picked up his new car
this morning.

23
00:01:01,319 --> 00:01:04,038
Congratulations.
Does it have that new-car smell?

24
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,714
Yep. For as long
as I can keep my mother out of it.

25
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,239
If you wanna check it out later,
it's parked right out front, Space 294.

26
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,590
-l'm sorry, 294?
-Yeah.

27
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,717
That's my parking spot.

28
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,276
Why do you have a parking spot?
You don't have a car. You don't drive.

29
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,869
It doesn't matter. That's my spot.

30
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:27,274
Maybe they reassigned it
because you never use it.

31
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,870
I'm not using my nipples either.
Maybe they should reassign those.

32
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:35,189
Sheldon, someday, if you get a car...

33
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:37,629
...l'm sure they'll give you
another parking space.

34
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,752
I don't want another parking space.
I want my parking space.

35
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:44,838
Well, it's perfect. It's a corner spot,
cutting the risk of door dings in half.

36
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:47,149
It's a mere 28 steps
from the building entrance.

37
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,557
The nearby tree provides shade
on hot days...

38
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,319
...and is also home
to a delightful squirrel...

39
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,394
...which is fortuitous
because most squirrels are real jerks.

40
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,997
Fun story.
Meanwhile, you still don't have a car.

41
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,633
Don't try to change the subject.

42
00:02:04,839 --> 00:02:07,990
This is about a parking space.
It has nothing to do with cars.

43
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,114
Are you listening to yourself?

44
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,238
I always listen to myself.
It's one of the greatjoys of my life.

45
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:17,075
-Now get your car out of my spot.
-Nope.

46
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:20,191
Very well, you leave me no choice.

What are you looking at,
you stupid squirrel?

00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,559
President Seibert, listen to reason.

51
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,593
Yeah, I understand
I don't use the parking spot.

52
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,950
That's not the point. In

53
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,708
Yes, I'm aware you told me
not to call you at home.

54
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,599
But you didn't answer the door.

55
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,397
And I know you were there
because I saw you through the mail slot.

56
00:03:15,079 --> 00:03:17,309
Yeah, well, that's some salty language.

57
00:03:17,559 --> 00:03:20,357
May I remind you, you're the president
of a major university...

58
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:22,993
...not the president
of the Potty Mouth Club.

59
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,394
There it is again.

60
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,034
Do you kiss your mother
with that mouth?

00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,550
Oh. Well, I'm sorry for your loss.

00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,713
Good night, sir.

63
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,473
Unbelievable.

64
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,916
He says Wolowitz deserves my spot...

65
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,509
...because he's a high-profile asset
to the university.

66
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,234
Well, he's not wrong. Howard did go
to the International Space Station.

67
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,634
That was five weeks ago.

68
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,910
How much longer
is he gonna milk that cow?

69
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:49,309
Sheldon, let it go. It's not a big deal.

70
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,391
No. No, this is a slippery slope, Leonard.

71
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:54,119
See, it starts with a parking space.
Where does it end?

72
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:57,635
It's like my dad always said,
"First they say you can't drink and drive.

73
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:00,268
Next you can't let your 10-year-old
take the wheel...

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,994
...while you sleep one off
in the backseat."

75
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,391
All that story does
is make me feel bad for your mother.

76
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,273
Leonard, you're my best friend.
Why don't you ever take my side?

77
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,797
Because I can never understand
your side!

78
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,913
Give it back.

79
00:04:22,119 --> 00:04:24,587
I'm sorry,
but could you be more specific?

80
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,837
My Iron Man helmet.
Koothrappali saw you take it. Give it back.

81
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:29,791
Oh, that.

82
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,431
Well, see, I wanted it
and you weren't using it.

83
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,513
Apparently,
those are the rules we live by now.

84
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:43,554
Payback, it truly is the B-word, isn't it?

85
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,270
Sheldon, that is a $500
limited-edition collectible...

86
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:49,707
...and I want it back.

87
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,717
Well, I'd love to help you out,
but unfortunately...

88
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:55,149
...l'm using it.

89
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,677
Fine. I'm taking your diploma.

90
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,712
SHELDON: Go ahead.
That's the only doctorate you'll ever get.

91
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:13,874
It smells funny in here.

92
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:17,469
We're so proud of you, Amy.
Your first bikini wax.

93
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,358
Yeah.

94
00:05:25,799 --> 00:05:26,834
So how you doing?

95
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,995
Oh, a little sensitive, but not bad.

96
00:05:29,559 --> 00:05:31,231
Does it always take that long?

97
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:34,596
Uh, no, they don't usually have to go out
and get more wax.

98
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:38,837
lfeel like I'm 5 pounds lighter.

99
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,509
Really? Only 5?

100
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:45,953
Anybody want a drink?

101
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,553
AMY: Sure.
BERNADETTE: Okay.

102
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,269
So did you spend last night hearing
about this silly parking-space fight too?

103
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:54,073
For hours. Fortunately,
I couldn't understand most of it...

104
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:56,839
...because Sheldon was wearing
that stupid robot mask.

105
00:05:57,799 --> 00:06:00,757
Howard was so angry, I had
to mash up Benadryl in his ice cream...

106
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,916
...to get him to fall asleep.

107
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:08,110
I guess this is what we get for being
with two testosterone-fueled alpha males.

108
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:11,230
At some point,
they're bound to lock horns.

109
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,716
I'm assuming these are some kind
of horns they bought at Comic-Con?

110
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,355
I'm really sorry
they took Sheldon's spot away.

111
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:22,437
He shouldn't have to suffer
just because Howard's a big deal now.

112
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,195
I know. Sheldon should just let Howard
have his little moment in the sun.

113
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:28,158
What's that supposed to mean?

114
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,989
Well, I mean,
Howard's never gonna go to space again...

115
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,873
...but Sheldon will always be a genius.

116
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:38,914
You're right. And I'm sure Sheldon
will get a fancy parking spot again...

117
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:42,276
...if and when he makes
a worthwhile contribution to science.

118
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,714
-If and when?
-Maybe we should change the subject.

119
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:49,638
Amy, how are your lady parts?
Still chilly down there?

120
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:56,111
Hang on. None of Sheldon's theories
have ever been definitively proven.

121
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,754
My husband actually went
to outer space.

122
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,517
That's an impressive accomplishment.

123
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,990
He's now an inspiration
to millions of Americans...

124
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,193
...who know you don't have to be special
or even qualified to go into space.

125
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:10,516
You know, I remember the first time
I got a bikini wax.

126
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,429
My sister did it with melted Crayolas
and duct tape.

127
00:07:14,719 --> 00:07:17,392
Yeah, it's a bad idea.

128
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:21,549
Gosh, Amy. I'm sensing a little hostility.

129
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:26,038
Is it maybe because, like Sheldon's work,
your sex life is also theoretical?

130
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,158
Damn.

131
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,512
Well, at least when we do make love...

132
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:37,153
...Sheldon won't be thinking
about his mother.

133
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:42,596
That is a cleverly veiled reference
to Howard's lifelong obsession...

134
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,910
...to crawl back into her spacious womb.

135
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,673
Anyway, to this day, I still can't see a box
of crayons without crossing my legs. Ha, ha.

136
00:07:52,119 --> 00:07:53,552
I don't have to take this.

137
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,513
I'm gonna go home
and have sex with my husband right now.

138
00:07:56,679 --> 00:07:59,796
Maybe I'll let him do it to me
in the parking spot.

139
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,828
Which sounds dirty
but I didn't mean it that way.

140
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:09,311
Okay, here's another one.

141
00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:12,790
If a zombie bites a vampire...

142
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,592
...and the vampire bites a human...

143
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:18,508
...does the human become a vampire
or a zombie?

144
00:08:19,239 --> 00:08:21,309
Or a zompire?

145
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,912
Sheldon?

146
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:26,837
Cookie?

147
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,548
-I don't have any.
-Well, I'm not giving it away.

148
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:36,268
HOWARD: Hi, Sheldon.
-Aah!

149
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:41,073
He's in my spot.

150
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,873
Leonard, make him stop being naked
in my spot.

151
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,830
Howard, what are you doing?

152
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:49,152
He wasn't using it...

153
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,912
...and I needed a nice cool piece of leather
to wiggle my naked ass on.

154
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,469
Get off there.

155
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:59,072
Give me back my Iron Man helmet.

156
00:08:59,319 --> 00:09:00,513
Give back my parking space.

157
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,069
You don't need a parking space.
You don't have a car.

158
00:09:03,319 --> 00:09:06,231
You don't need an Iron Man helmet.
You're not Iron Man.

159
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:09,949
Well, we appear
to have reached an impasse...

160
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,998
...and, you know, I have to say,
I thought you'd be more upset...

161
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,152
...that your laptop is sitting on myjunk.

162
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:20,429
I didn't pick up on that.
That's a nice touch.

163
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,755
This is so exciting. I'm feeling all tingly.

164
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:37,752
Although, that could just be
my newly defoliated bikini zone.

165
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:39,874
Keep a lookout.

166
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,588
This place is swarming
with campus security.

167
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:45,148
