00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,156
Is anyone else troubled
by the Spider-Man theme song?

2
00:00:08,239 --> 00:00:11,390
Why would it trouble you?
It's your third-favorite cartoon theme song.

3
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:15,711
It is, right behind,
"Do, do, do, do, do, Inspector Gadget."

And Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

However, the Spider-Man lyrics posit
that Spider-Man, Spider-Man...

7

-...does whatever a spider can.
-Yeah, so?

8

I can think of many things
Spider-Man can't do that a spider can.

Two, legally leave Guatemala
without a passport.

And three, have sex with a spider.

12
00:00:44,839 --> 00:00:48,991
Can we change the subject?
Spiders give me the jeebie-jeebies.

13
00:00:49,959 --> 00:00:51,711
It's "heebie-jeebies."

14
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,673
I know, but that sounds anti-Semitic.

a little film festival tonight.

It's for one of her colleagues

39

is to casually remark...

...no matter how deep they dig his grave,
he'll never make his way back to China.
