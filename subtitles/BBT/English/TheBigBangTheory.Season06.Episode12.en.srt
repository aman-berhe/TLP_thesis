I could do something about it.

335
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,675
So, I got a course catalog at school
and looked at some of the science classes.

336
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,398
-That's great.
-No, it isn't...

337
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,915
...they are extremely boring, how do you
not kill yourself, like, every day?

338
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,679
Anyway, I decided I don't need to be
a scientist, I could just look like one.

339
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:27,272
So I bought these.

340
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:30,878
Glasses? I really don't think
that's gonna change--

341
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,032
Oh, my God, you look so smart and hot!

342
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:36,549
I know, right? Watch this.

343
00:19:41,719 --> 00:19:43,516
Molecules.

344
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,436
-Okay, come with me.
-Where are we going?

345
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,434
To my bedroom so I can take everything off
but those glasses.

346
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,273
And maybe the boots.

347
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,991
