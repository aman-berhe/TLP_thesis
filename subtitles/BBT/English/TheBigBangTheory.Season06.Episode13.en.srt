00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,478
Hey, will you steam my uniform next?

2
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:08,352
Interesting.
Do you recall this conversation?

3
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,789
"Leonard, wanna go halfsies
on a steamer?"

4
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:13,507
"No, Sheldon, we don't need a steamer."

5
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:17,513
Looks like that rumpled
chicken's come home to roost.

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,516
Hi. Here are the makeup
sponges you asked for.

7
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:23,187
-Oh, thanks, I thought I had more.
-Hmm.

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,279
Damn, you've got more makeup than I do.

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:32,836
You've got better makeup than I do.
Yeah, I'm borrowing this.

10
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,031
Hey, hey, hey,
this is my Comic-Con makeup.

11
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,834
I love you, but there are some things
a man doesn't share with his girlfriend.

12
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,118
That's a wise policy.

13
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:44,958
I once borrowed my sister's makeup
for a costume contest...

14
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,798
...got a terrible case of pink eye.

15
00:00:46,999 --> 00:00:50,275
Yeah, well, luckily, I was going
as a zombie, I won second place.

16
00:00:51,599 --> 00:00:53,191
You guys just went to Comic-Con.

17
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,238
That was San Diego Comic-Con.
This is Bakersfield Comic-Con.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,036
-Is that better?
-Well, it's a lot smaller.

19
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:00,433
It's about the comic books.

20
00:01:00,639 --> 00:01:03,437
The way these conventions used to be
before they went Hollywood.

21
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:05,988
So to answer your question,
no, it's not better.

22
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:08,554
Then why are you going?

23
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,638
It's a comic book convention.

24
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,630
Like pizza or particle accelerators...

25
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,956
...even the stinky ones, still pretty good.

26
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:18,233
Well, you guys have fun.
I guess I'll see you Sunday.

27
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:20,509
-Yeah. Oh, hang on a second.
-Okay.

28
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,472
Hold this.

29
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:30,311
-What was that for?
-To show people when they don't believe me.

30
00:01:57,559 --> 00:02:00,995
This is the best. You have booze with
breakfast on Tuesday, you got a problem.

31
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,470
You do it on the weekend,
you got brunch.

32
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,552
Sheldon doesn't believe in brunch.

33
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:10,110
Can't stand a table where one person's having
an omelet and another is having a sandwich.

34
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,349
That's not exhausting at all.

35
00:02:14,999 --> 00:02:15,988
[PHONE BEEPS]

36
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,149
Oh.

37
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,632
It's Leonard. He says they're on the road
and headed for Bakersfield at warp speed.

38
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,998
Maybe it's the mimosa,
but I'm gonna give the kid an LOL.

39
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,148
Cute how excited they are.

40
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,999
You should have seen Howard
sewing his costume all week.

41
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,833
When did Howard learn to sew?

42
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:36,958
When he was a little boy, every couple of
months he'd have to let his mom's pants out.

43
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,355
I don't understand
why they go to these conventions.

44
00:02:42,559 --> 00:02:45,551
The four of them work at a major university,
they're all smart...

45
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:47,994
...how can they be into something
for 12-year-olds?

46
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,829
I don't mind it. I think Howie's
just in touch with his inner child.

47
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,792
Although when he's in Batman pajamas...

48
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,918
...sometimes it feels like
I'm touching his inner child.

49
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,075
It's probably because they were bullied.
In a world where you can't fight back...

50
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:05,270
...superheroes provide
meaningful wish-fulfillment.

51
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:08,954
Hmm. Now I feel bad for picking on
all those kids.

52
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,038
Although if Danny Biffle
didn't want to eat a mouthful of dirt...

53
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:14,839
...he shouldn't have shown up
to school wearing a bow tie.

54
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,230
I've never even read a comic book.
You guys?

55
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,389
PENNY: Mm-mm.
-No.

56
00:03:19,559 --> 00:03:21,436
It's such an important part of their lives.

57
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:24,437
-Maybe we should try reading some.
-Seriously?

58
00:03:25,359 --> 00:03:27,350
The comic book store isn't far from here.

59
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:30,027
That is an amazing idea.

60
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,196
Okay, how many of these have I had?

61
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,149
I think you should turn on the GPS.

62
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,395
It is on.

63
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,955
But the turn-by-turn voice option isn't on.

64
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,317
I know I'd feel more safe
if you turn on the turn-by-turn voice option.

65
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,630
I love the turn-by-turn voice option.

66
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:53,272
Has it really only been 10 miles?

67
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,919
I'm turning it on, butjust to shut you up.

68
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:02,838
GPS [IN SHELDON'S VOICE]: Leonard,
bear left and continue on Interstate 210.

69
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,672
Ooh, sounds like that fellow
knows what he's talking about.

70
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,553
I'd put on my listening ears if I were you.

71
00:04:10,999 --> 00:04:13,911
-What did you do?
-I found a hack online.

72
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,749
l was able to upload MP3 recordings
of my voice to your GPS.

73
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,838
-That is so cool.
-Counterpoint, no, it's not.

74
00:04:22,359 --> 00:04:26,398
6 PS :
Continue on Interstate 210 for ﬁve miles.

75
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,272
Here's an interesting fact
about Interstates:

76
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,357
-Really?
-Shh!

77
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,635
He said it's interesting.

78
00:04:34,679 --> 00:04:37,273
6 PS :
Interstates are numbered as follows:

79
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:41,074
Even-numbered routes run east and west.

80
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:45,074
Odd-numbered routes run
north and south.

81
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,673
Three-digit route numbers
indicate bypasses or spurs.

82
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:55,511
Look, Leonard, there's a bridge.
Drive off it.

83
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,949
You know, we're not that far
from Vasquez Rocks.

84
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,072
Oh, they shot a lot of
Star Trek episodes out there.

85
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,150
We got our costumes in the trunk...

86
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:06,634
...we could go there
and have a little photo shoot.

87
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:10,196
Great idea. I haven't had
a carbohydrate in two weeks.

88
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,359
These cheekbones need to be in front of a
camera before I eat a pretzel and they're gone.

89
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,914
-It sounds fun.
-Oh, smashing.

90
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,310
Now, Leonard,
do you know how to get there?

91
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,313
-No.
-Yeah, well, luckily, someone in the car does.

While we're waiting,
do you know which president...

94
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,753
...signed the
Interstate Highway System Act into law?

95
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,436
The answer coming up in 14 miles.

96
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:42,036
None of you will get it. It's Eisenhower.

97
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,911
Why are they staring?

98
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:59,949

Could you please stop staring?
They're just girls.

in movies or in drawings.

-Hey, Stuart.
-What brings you guys here?

104
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,228
We were looking for a recommendation
about comic books.

105
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,591
Well, I recommend you don't
open a store and sell them.

106
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:28,435
We were wondering why the guys
like this stuff, so we thought we'd try it.

107
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,675
Oh, okay.
What do you think you might be into?

108
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,235
Superhero? Fantasy?
Graphic novels? Manga?

109
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,000
I swear I will turn a hose on you.

110

111
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,076
Um, a little bit of everything.
Mostly superhero stuff.

112
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,238
-All right, well, who's the best superhero?
-Shh!

113
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:52,994
You can't ask a question like that in here.
Are you trying to start a rumble?

114
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:56,157

Anybody got any ideas?

00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:22,514
Nope. The only thing left to do now
is assign blame.

00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,274
Good idea.
Why don't you get started on that?

170
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,353
Come on, let's just start walking.

171
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,398
There's gotta be a gas station
or something nearby.

172
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,195
What, you thinkjust because you're wearing
a captain's uniform you're in charge?

173
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,118
Yes.

174
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,192
All right.

175
00:10:37,599 --> 00:10:38,873
Okay, I'm done.

176
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,989
-How did you guys finish so fast?
-I don't know, there were a lot of pictures.

177
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:46,271
And one page only had the word
"brakka-dooom!"

178
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,829
Yeah, well, I have street smarts.

179
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:52,908
So, what'd you guys think?

180
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,960
-Well, there was a lot of action.
PENNY: Hmm.

181
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,435
And the story moved along
at a brisk pace.

182
00:10:58,599 --> 00:11:01,955
It was, overall,
what's the word I'm looking for...?

183
00:11:02,199 --> 00:11:03,393
-Stupid?
-So stupid.

184
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:06,675
I don't know how Leonard
can get so caught up.

185
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,076
It's crazy. They spend hours arguing
about things that don't even exist.

186
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:11,558
-What a waste of time.
-I know.

187
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:13,949
A hammer so heavy
that no one else can pick it up?

188
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,838
[SCOFFS]

189
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,598
I don't think it's heavy, I think it's some
sort of magic so only Thor can lift it.

190
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,916
That makes even less sense, I mean....

191
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:26,230
No, no, no, it doesn't.

192
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:30,157
Thor is a god. The hammer is his.
Only he can use it.

193
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,079
It's like Sheldon and his toothbrush.

194
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,594
Or his thin, beckoning lips.

195
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:40,432
Okay, hang on, what if Thor's hand
is on the hammer?

196
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:43,995
If he's touching it with his god magic,
then does that mean I could lift it?

197
00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:45,757
-No.
-Yes.

198
00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:48,518
Well, which is it?

199
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:51,878
-Maybe we missed something.
-Let's read it again.

200
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,678
-Okay.
-Yeah.

201
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:02,711
-You want some tea?
-Good idea. I'll help you.

202
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:06,234
-Wait, I thought we were reading?
-We are.

203
00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:09,875
We're just, uh, giving you a head start.

204
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,798
lwish my mom was here.

205
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,874
We could all hang out in her shadow.

206
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:27,630
Wool pants in the desert.

207
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,558
I feel like I've got poached testicles.

208
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:34,509
Oh, you poor thing, you're sweating.

209
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,109
That's so much worse
than having your car stolen.

210
00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:41,870
Insurance is gonna buy you a new car.
It's not gonna de-funk myjunk.

211
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,030
Gentlemen, a little less bellyaching.

212
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,550
We're Starfleet officers
and a member of the Borg Collective.

213
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:52,432
Please, Sheldon, I am so not in the mood.

214
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,152
Leonard...

215
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,272
...all our lives
we have dreamed of finding ourselves...

216
00:12:57,479 --> 00:12:59,788
...inside one of the fantasy worlds
we love.

217
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,759
And look at us.

218
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:05,554
At this moment, we are, in fact,
a Star Trek landing party...

219
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:09,115
...stranded in an alien
and unforgiving environment.

220
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:13,427
Relying only on our wits,
our fortitude and our moxie.

221
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,797
As long as we have those things...

222
00:13:15,999 --> 00:13:17,717
-...nothing can stop us--
MAN: Nerds!

223
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,393
I hate this planet.

224
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:32,791
It says right here on the hammer:

225
00:13:32,999 --> 00:13:36,912
"Whoever holds this hammer, if he be
worthy, shall possess the power of Thor."

226
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,793
Hold on. Who decides who's worthy?
Does the hammer decide?

227
00:13:39,999 --> 00:13:41,557
-Yes!
-No!

228
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,877
-It can't decide, it's a hammer.
-You said it's a magic hammer!

229
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:48,751
Yeah, but it can't make decisions.

230
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,871
If Harry Potter's wand can make decisions,
why can't Thor's hammer?

231
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,240
Okay, if you're gonna start comparing wands
and hammers, I can't even take you seriously.

232
00:14:14,439 --> 00:14:15,952
Hello.

233
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,679
Hello.

234
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:22,989
Four glasses of water, please.

235
00:14:24,319 --> 00:14:25,718
Anything for you guys?

236
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,913
Can I use your phone?
Our car got stolen.

237
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,997
Why don't you ask Scotty
to beam you up?

238
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:33,996
[ALL LAUGHING]

239
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,036
Scotty was on the original series
and we're Next Generation.

240
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,193
So joke's on you.

241
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,469
We're not with him.

242
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,400
You can't pick something up
in outer space.

243
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:57,038
In space, there is no up.

244
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,198
Oh, yeah? Then how does
the sun come up every day?

245
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,350
Hard to argue
with those kind of street smarts.

246
00:15:09,439 --> 00:15:12,636
Leonard and Sheldon have boxes of comics.
Why don't we go look at those?

247
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,400
Oh, great. And then you will see,
lam not wrong.

248
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,279
If we were in outer space,
anyone could pick up the hammer...

249
00:15:18,479 --> 00:15:21,152
...because it would be floating
in a weightless environment.

250
00:15:21,319 --> 00:15:24,470
Yeah, that's right,
the slow reader used science. Suck on that.

251
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,951
-Was there anything valuable in the car?
-Our clothes, our wallets, phones.

252
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,639
And about $300 worth of makeup...

253
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,758
...so this thief could look like
anyone right now.

254
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,748
Makeup? Sure.

255
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,837
We're going to the Comic-Con in Bakersfield.
They have a big costume contest.

256
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,110
It's cooler than it sounds.

257
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,635
I don't know, sounds pretty cool.

258
00:15:55,359 --> 00:15:56,997
It is. It's notjust comic books.

259
00:15:57,159 --> 00:16:00,276
They've got action figures,
toys, a Tron themed dance party--

260
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,232
Okay, he gets how cool it is.

261
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,191
lthinkl have all I need here.
You guys need me to call someone?

262
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,674
I'm guessing your moms?

263
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,758
Thanks, but we've got it covered.

264
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,348
Okay, I just talked to my mom.

265
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,555
She arranged for us to get a rental car.

266
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,556
Great, we can still make it to Comic-Con.

267
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,031
Are you kidding me? After all we've
been through? I just want to go home.

268
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:30,197
Don't be like that.
Come on, Howard, talk to him.

269
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,039
I'm with Leonard. I'm done.

270
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,949
Fine, then I guess it's two against two.
How do we decide?

271
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:40,637
Actually, it's three against one.

272
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,749
What? Well, what about the mission?
You said we're a real-life landing party.

273
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,473
Well, we're not.

274
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,069
We're an imaginary landing party.

275
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,956
Who had real-life garbage thrown at us
by real-life strangers who think we're idiots.

276
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:57,319
And to tell you the truth,
I'm starting to feel like one.

277
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,911
I want to go home now.

278
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,759
Okay.

279
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:06,038
Did we at least rent the car
from Enterprise?

280
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,877
Get it? Enterprise? Heh.

281
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,595
Screw you, that's funny.

282
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,991
Well, what if the Hulk picked up Thor
while Thor is holding the hammer?

283
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,236
-Yeah?
-Then by the transitive property...

284
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,233
...of picking things up,
Hulk picked up the hammer.

285
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,599
No, Hulk picked up Thor,
Thor picked up the hammer.

286
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:34,035
Hang on, ifl go to a bar and pick
up a guy, and he picks up a girl...

287
00:17:34,239 --> 00:17:36,912
...and then we all leave together,
did I pick up the girl?

288
00:17:41,199 --> 00:17:43,030
Did that ever happen?

289
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:47,307
Hey, we talking about me
or are we talking about Thor?

290
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:57,112
Well, I say that's the last time
we ever go outside.

291
00:17:57,879 --> 00:18:00,677
AMY: Look right here,
Red Hulk is picking up Thor's hammer...

292
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:02,272
...because Thor is touching it.

293
00:18:02,439 --> 00:18:04,475
PENNY:
No, it's because they're in space!

294
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,518
BERNADETTE: He's touching the strap.
AMY: The strap is part of the hammer!

295
00:18:07,719 --> 00:18:09,311
PENNY:
No, it's not!

296
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,759
Are they actually
arguing about comic books?

297
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,313
No, that can't be right.

298
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,559
Maybe Thor's Hammer
is a new color of nail polish.

299
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,392
BERNADETTE:
Then Red Hulk must be worthy!

300
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,318
PENNY:
How could Red Hulk be worthy?

301
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,397
BERNADETTE:
You don't know his life.

302
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:33,316
There's only one logical explanation:
Somewhere in the desert...

303
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,875
...we crossed into
an alternate dimension...

304
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:39,994
...where the women in our lives
can finally appreciate great literature.

305
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:44,275
If it's an alternate dimension...

306
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:46,709
...that sounds like ajob
for a landing party.

307
00:18:51,199 --> 00:18:53,269
Captain, what are your orders?

308
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,671
I say we investigate.

309
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,755
Wait.

310
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,753
They might be hostile.

311
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:09,071
Fine, but set them to stun.

312
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:12,589
If we vaporize Penny, I'll never
find a girlfriend that pretty again.

Fun fact:

314
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,195
President Eisenhower
signed the Federal Aid HighwayAct...

Wow, that is interesting.

that are not served by the Interstate System?
