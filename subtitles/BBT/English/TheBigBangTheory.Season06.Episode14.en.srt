1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,355
I don't know why I avoided the Harry Potter
books for so long. These are great.

2
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:10,517
-| just started number six.
-That's a good one.

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,199
Dumbledore dies in that one.

4
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:17,827
Yeah, I know, I didn't see it coming, either.

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,233
Why would you say that?

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,676
You brought up a subject,
I contributed a fact on that subject.

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,917
It's called the art of conversation.
Okay, your turn.

8
00:00:28,759 --> 00:00:30,397
That was a huge spoiler.

9
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,112
Good.

10
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:36,992
What is wrong with you?
If I did that, you'd bitch about it for weeks.

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,430
Really, Leonard?
Gonna have one of your hissy fits?

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,512
Hissy fits? l have hissy fits?

13
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:44,153
Yes. And I have a theory why.

14
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:48,318
Because of your lactose intolerance,
you switched over to soy milk.

15
00:00:48,519 --> 00:00:51,716
Soy contains estrogen-mimicking
compounds.

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,835
I think your morning Cocoa Puffs
are turning you into a hysterical woman.

17
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:03,757
You are unbelievable.
I don't know whyl put up with you.

18
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,357
-You're controlling, you're irritating--
-There you go again. Nag, nag, nag.

19
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,436
You're only proving my point, little lady.

20
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,158
You know what, screw you, Sheldon.

21
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,635
You're the most annoying person
I've ever met.

22
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,628
I'm annoying?
You criticize my behavior all the time.

23
00:01:20,839 --> 00:01:24,718
"Sheldon, don't talk about
your bowel movements over breakfast."

24
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:27,069
"Sheldon, when the president
of the university...

25
00:01:27,279 --> 00:01:30,874
...is giving a eulogy at a funeral,
don't yawn and point at your watch."

26
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:33,798
"Sheldon, don't throw away my shirts
because they're ugly."

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,228
You're impossible.

28
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:38,150
That's it, I don't have to put up with this.

29
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:42,187
Actually, I have your signature
on a roommate agreement that says you do.

30
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,796
Aww. Here's what I think
of your roommate agreement.

31
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,109
[GASPS]

32
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,430
-You pick that up right now.
-No.

33
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,591
Roommate agreement,
section 27, paragraph 5:

34
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:57,474
"The roommate agreement, like the
American flag, cannot touch the ground."

35
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,073
I don't care.

36
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,519
I don't have to do anything you say.
I don't think I wanna live here anymore.

37
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,311
-Where are you going?
-To live with Penny...

38
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,913
...not you, you crazy bastard.

39
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,997
-Crazy bastard?
-Yes.

40
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,472
-Leonard, wait.
-What?

41
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,998
Dobby the Elf dies in book seven.

42
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:48,708
Here you go.

43
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:51,592
-Great. Come on in.
-What, you don't say thank you?

44
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,278
It's my suitcase.
l lent it to you two years ago.

45
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,115
I should tell you
I broke the wheel and the handle.

46
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,477
So is everyone from Bernadette's company
going to Vegas?

47
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,274
No, just me, her,
and a couple of the bigwigs.

48
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,112
It's part of a bonus she got.

49
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,356
Cool. Did she discover a cure
for something?

50
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:15,438
Not exactly. They spent a ton of money
developing this dandruff medication...

51
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,036
...that had the side effect
of horrible anal leakage.

52
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,276
Is there a good anal leakage?

53
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:30,277
Anyway, it was Bernie's idea to rebrand
the stuff as a cure for constipation.

54
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,589
Way to make lemonade, you know, from
around the corner where fudge is made.

55
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:41,432
-Hey, I got a favor to ask.
-Sure.

56
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,200
My mom's been
kind of an emotional wreck...

57
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,238
...since that dentist she was dating
dumped her.

58
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,113
Dumped her? What did he use, a forklift?

59
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,073
Sorry.

60
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:56,839
There's nothing funny
about morbid obesity.

61
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,237
She's huge, it was funny.

62
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:03,594
Anyway, I was just hoping that maybe you
could check in on her tomorrow night...

63
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,515
-...make sure she's doing okay.
-Dude, I'm a single man.

64
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,109
Saturday night is my party night.

65
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:13,035
Really, what do you got going on?

66
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,395
I don't know, maybe drive
down to Hollywood...

67
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,790
...hit a few hot spots,
see ifl can get lucky.

68
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,198
Tell me if this sounds familiar. Ahem.

69
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,832
You pay $15 to park,
you stand on the sidewalk for an hour...

70
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,759
...until you break down and
give the bouncer 20 to let you in.

71
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,230
You push your way to the bar
where you drink an $18 cosmopolitan.

72
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,716
Then you stare at a pretty girl
and imagine your perfect life together.

73
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:37,592
Children, grandchildren.
Meanwhile, she leaves with a guy...

74
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:40,074
...who claims he wrote
Beverly Hills Chihuahua.

75
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:43,754
Then you give up on love,
go to Marie Callender's...

76
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,912
...buy a pie and eat it in your car
in the parking lot.

77
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,512
-What time should I be at your mother's?
-I told her around 7.

78
00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:58,911
I swear, that man is the most egotistical,
insufferable human being I have ever met.

79
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,867
Yeah, but you two
make such a cute couple.

80
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:05,037
Like Bert and Ernie.

81
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:09,470
You guys even teach me stuff
about words and numbers.

82
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,993
Well, I've had it, I am done.

83
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,952
I can't live with him one more minute.

84
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,878
Wow, where are you gonna go?

85
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:17,910
Well, I was thinking here with you.

86
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,674
Oh.

87
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:23,953
Is that a problem?

88
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,628
No, no, no. It's great.

89
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:29,951
It's terrific. You know, I just can't
help feel bad about Sheldon.

90
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,118
I mean, how's he gonna
get by without you...

91
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,913
...Ernie?

92
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,558
-He's got Amy now.
-Yeah, he does...

93
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,148
-...but it's not the same.
-Why?

94
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,674
Um....

95
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,675
Well, all right, you know how
in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince...

96
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:51,076
...Ron didn't abandon Harry
because Harry started dating Ron's sister?

97
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,794
Harry and Ginny get together?

98
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:02,396
Sorry, spoiler alert. My point is,
as much as I want to live with you...

99
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:04,874
...I can't do it knowing how much
Sheldon needs you.

100
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,917
Please. The only thing he needs me for
is to be his whipping boy.

101
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,832
His stooge, his doormat.

102
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:12,718
Well, you know what they say,
if it ain't broke....

103
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,197
Wow, it sounds to me like
you don't want us to live together.

104
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:23,598
No. No, no, I do. I do.
It's just-- It's a really big step.

105
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,116
Is it? We're together all the time.
Financially, it makes great sense.

106
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:30,278
Can you think of one reason
why we shouldn't do this?

107
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,716
Well, um....

108
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,000
Heh. I'm just a little thirsty.

109
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:42,312
I got nothing.

110
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:45,673
Great. I'll go get my stuff.

111
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,630
Okay. All right, don't freak out.
You can make this work.

112
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:58,429
Oh. Could you clear off a shelf for me
in the bathroom? I take a lot of medicine.

113
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,354
Oh, please, let some of it be Xanax.

114
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,834
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Are you ready for dessert?

115
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:11,838
No, thank you, Mrs. Wolowitz.

116
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,794
As is, I'm going to have to carry
my stomach out of here...

117
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,235
...like I'm afireman rescuing an infant.

118
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,479
Oh, please, you're a tall glass
of brown water.

119
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,238
-Have dessert.
-I really couldn't.

120
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,989
But I've had a lovely time eating your
brisket and hearing about the things...

121
00:07:30,239 --> 00:07:32,992
...you've had removed from your body
over the years.

122
00:07:33,799 --> 00:07:36,871
I didn't know you could have
a cyst inside another cyst.

123
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,749
The doctor said they were like
Russian nesting dolls.

124
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:46,310
Well, if you have to go, how about
I put a little doggie bag together for you?

125
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,198
That would be lovely, thank you.

126
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,992
[MRS. WOLOWITZ CRIES]

127
00:07:52,359 --> 00:07:54,190
Mrs. Wolowitz...

128
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:56,308
...are you okay?

129
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,747
Don't mind me.

130
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:01,508
ljust cry when I'm lonely
and have nothing to live for.

131
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,999


132
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:10,555
I suppose I could stay for some dessert.

133
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,830
Great. You like
chocolate chip cheesecake?

134
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,508
-Sure.
-l'll make one.

135
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:22,116
One vintage Mr. Mxyzptlk action figure.

136
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:26,230
-That's Leonard's.
-Children's toy.

137
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,352
One Star Trek: The Next Generation
phaser.

138
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,589
That's Leonard's.

139
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:33,316
Children's toy.

140
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,630
One Game of Thrones
collector's edition Longclaw sword.

141
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,273
Leonard and I bought that together.

142
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,869
That's a bit of an ethical conundrum.

143
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:46,597
I'll keep it.

144
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,271
So, what's your plan moving forward?

145
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,677
I suppose I'll have to find and cultivate
a new roommate.

146
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:54,551
What a task that will be.

147
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:58,115
Do you know how uncivilized
Leonard was when I took him in?

148
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:00,910
-No.
-It took me forever...

149
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,076
...to get him on a bathroom schedule.

150
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:06,796
He would just go
whenever the mood struck him.

151
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:10,876
-Like a dog boy.
-Exactly.

152
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,117
What if you could find a roommate
who was a scientist...

153
00:09:14,319 --> 00:09:16,787
...and already familiar and comfortable
with your ways?

154
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:18,318
That would be ideal.

155
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:23,507
If a person like that existed,
I would sign on, no further questions asked.

156
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,631
Great, here I am.

157
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,148
Wait.

158
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,157
Here who is where?

159
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,911
Me. Aren't | your perfect roommate?

160
00:09:39,199 --> 00:09:41,918
-Um....
-Think about it, Sheldon.

161
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,680
I'm not a stranger,
we're intellectually compatible...

162
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:47,996
...l'm willing to chauffeur you around,
and your personality quirks...

163
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,239
...which others find abhorrent
or rage-inducing, I find cute as a button.

164
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,078
What do you think?

165
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,593
Um....

166
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,234
Tell me one reason
