00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,795
You'll never believe
what happened to me at work.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,117
This old guy was choking on his food
and I saved his life.

3
00:00:09,319 --> 00:00:10,388
Did you Heimlich him?

4
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:12,874
No, I said,
"I think that old guy's choking."

5
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:15,195
Then one of the busboys Heimlich'd him.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,752
You're a hero.

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,754
Yeah, that was the point of the story.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,355
Do you know
if you have Thursday night off?

9
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:26,838
Uh, I think so, why?

10
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:28,717
Why? It's Valentine's Day.

11
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:31,274
Oh, right.
Yeah, we can do something.

12
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,432
-You could be a little more into it.
-l'm into it, I'm into it.

13
00:00:35,639 --> 00:00:38,631
There's pressure to make the night special
and it never works out.

14
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:43,629
Well, this time it's gonna be different
because I'm like a romance ninja. Heh.

15

Ooh! Ya!

17
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,399
Sometimes I think I've made you
cooler than you used to be...

00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,749
...then you go
and do that.

19
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,279
So in conclusion,
I believe the painful sensation felt...

20
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:04,312
...after passing a meal
of spicy chilies is proof...

21
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:08,115
...that the rectum does possess
the sense of taste.

Not really, other than hiding
all the sharp objects around here...

...but she got worms
and then I had to take her to the vet.

38

There must be something
we can do.

39
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,198
Uh, how about, uh,
you keep the store open late...

40
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,834
...and we throw a party for people
who don't have dates?

41
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,072
That actually sounds kind of nice.

42
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,154
The theme will be that the greatest love
a man can have is love he has with himself.

43
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:56,788
That's good...

really romantic to give Bernadette...

microscope in the materials-science lab...
