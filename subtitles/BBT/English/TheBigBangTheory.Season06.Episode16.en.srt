[ALL LAUGHING]

327
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,273
But we also--
When we wrote theremin in for Jim...

328
00:15:47,439 --> 00:15:49,316
...and he went and learned
to play the theremin.

329
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,234
Of course we wrote harp in for Mayim
and she went to learn to play the harp.

330
00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:57,227
But the theremin is an almost
impossible instrument to play.

331
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,719
And then you were so upset.

332
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:02,713
"I'm not that good a theremin player,"
you'd say.

333
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,030
That brought me to tears. I won't lie.
I'm not exaggerating.

334
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:08,554
That one made me cry.

335
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,034
MOLARO: When Sheldon is playing
the theremin in the show...

336
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,032
...Jim is playing the theremin.
We did not go and add that in later.

337
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:16,429
-That is real.
-I don't know if it's impressive actually.

00:16:16,599 --> 00:16:19,352
MOLARO: It's very impressive.
-l'm not sure.

-That was awful.

-That look fake to you?

-Yeah.

343
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:28,954
-That's what scares me. It looked real.
-That was no CGI.

not to try and breathe through my nose.

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,357
Sorry.

348
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,630
Highly allergic person. Remember my eyes
were watering for weeks after.

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,597
-I had blueberry in my eyes.
-We all hurt.

350
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:48,875
I kept them open. It was terrible.

351
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,157
GALECKI: I think that was more
traumatizing for Jim and l than the girls.

352
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:55,669
-None of us wanted to see that play.
-Why was it more traumatizing for you?

353
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,036
Well, we were just more vocal about
our complaints, maybe that was it.

354
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,794
-Men usually are.
-Yup. That was really unpleasant.

00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,075
-That was gnarly.
-Yeah.

356
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,357
-We did it two days in a row.

The flash mob. Kaley.

359
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,757
It had just been a dream of mine
to do a flash mob.

360
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:17,752
And I said, "Guess what?
You're all doing it with me."

361
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,150
I had this idea for many moons,
many years, many seasons.

362
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,311
I thought, "Gosh that would
be so awesome."

363
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,789
So I kind of asked around the crew...

364
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:29,190
...if they'd be interested and they were like,
"Oh, my God, that would be so fun."

365
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,478
Sol kind of told the cast, like kind of--
Yeah, I did tell them we're doing this.

366
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,757
I said, "I wanna surprise the writers.
We'll do it in front of a live taping."

367
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:41,151
I didn't know how, but my sister happens to
be an incredible dancer and choreographer.

368
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,555
So I called her.
I'm like, "Okay, I have this idea.

369
00:17:43,719 --> 00:17:45,550
I wanna do a flash mob
with our entire crew...

370
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:48,438
...in front of a taping in like two weeks.
Here are the songs."

371
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:51,591
I sent her six songs
because I wanted it to be really long.

372
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,796
And I'm like,
"You think you can put this together?"

373
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,155
She called me back in 30 minutes.
She goes, "I have it."

374
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,158
And put herself on her phone to show me.
I'm like, "You don't have it."

375
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,555
She did the whole thing.
She had done the whole thing.

376
00:18:01,719 --> 00:18:05,394
And came the next day and our crew
took a long lunch and we learned it.

377
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:09,347
And the guys and the girls,
we all learned it and we did it.

378
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,910
And it was the best moment
of my whole life!

379
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:16,356
And we didn't tell anyone.
We didn't tell the writers.

380
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,470
It was funny,
because it was the end of a show.

381
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,278
So the show had wrapped,
but we all went into the living room set.

382
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,431
Everyone was like,
"We didn't write another scene."

383
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,556
You know, we're sitting in there
like ready to go.

384
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,752
And then the music started
and it was magic.

00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:31,479
PERRETTE: It's pretty amazing. Yeah.
You guys were--

386
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,154
-It is the best thing I've ever done.
PERRETTE: You got good moves.

387
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,636

-He didn't get a lot of time to learn it.

388
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:40,836
-He was very busy that week.
-Kaley was very kind and said:

389
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,912
-I said, "You gotta be in this. We gotta do--"
-"Here's the deal.

390
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:47,958

391
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,755
...and watch us...

392
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:54,753
...and when the whole thing's over,
just go, 'Bazinga.' Or not.

And I said, "It's a deal."

-l was very grateful for my choreography.

and you were surprised.

-The last day.
-He thought it was just ridiculous.

-"I have a life to live."

and I saw the last rehearsal.

00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,629

-"I really wanna be a part of this."
-Yeah. It was so fun.

-But I don't have time to learn...

410
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:37,149
...so I'm just gonna come in
and do a back spin...

411
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,153

It was so cute that night,
because it was the taping.

00:19:53,999 --> 00:19:57,036
So if you were behind the scenes
or near craft service or walking around...

419
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,992
...you saw someone back there going...

420
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,236

-...trying to memorize their moves.

421

-Secretly.

422
00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:05,311
Melissa and l were practicing
in my room.

00:20:05,479 --> 00:20:08,312
I kept saying, "Melissa, I don't know it.
Please come and show me."

00:20:08,479 --> 00:20:10,993
It's really actually touching
for me to watch it.

to how much we all...

just love spending time together.

lunches up to stay later after rehearsal...

because I love my sister.

...and she ended up choreographing
for Two and a Half Men...

-...that dance number that they did.

The Big Bang Theory. I've learned so much.

I know a little. I can ask for directions.

and we finished--

Where did the "Soft Kitty, Warm Kitty"
song originate?

505
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,357
This is from my daughter's preschool
in Sherman Oaks.

506
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:16,277
And they used to sing "Soft Kitty"
and I'd never heard it before...

507
00:24:16,439 --> 00:24:21,672
...and I guess it was from Australia
and one of the teachers had heard it there.

508
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:24,114
GALECKI: But then Bill came down
to the stage with a recorder...

-...to play us the melody.
PARSONS: Oh, my God. He's right.

at him playing the recorder...

at us and said:

"If any of you wondered
why I'm the writer on a nerd show...

out from under your legs?"
