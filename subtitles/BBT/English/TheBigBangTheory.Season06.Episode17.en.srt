Can I have your attention, please?

00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,631
We're all here tonight because
we have no one to be with.

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:14,516
We gotta stop defining our self-worth...

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,875
...by whether or not we're in a relationship.

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,756
We are a community...

7
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:24,231
...and as long as we have each other,
we're never truly alone.

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,871
That was cool. What you said.

9
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,358
Thank you.

get a cup of coffee?

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,549
Okay.

12
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,678
Later, losers!

13
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:54,677
So then I went to Cambridge,
which was wonderful...

14
00:00:54,839 --> 00:00:59,151
...not only because it's a good school,
but because it totally looks like Hogwarts.

15
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,158
That's where I fell in love with astronomy,
and now I'm an astrophysicist at Caltech.

16
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,678
So I guess you could say, uh,
Raj is my name, and stars are my game.

17
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,993
And rhyming is also my game.

18
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:15,992
So, uh, two games.

than I care to admit.

I did shoot one last week
in honor of Black History Month...

32
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:36,231
...but I was informed by my roommate
that my spot-on portrayal...

33
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,518
...of George Washington Carver
could be considered "wildly racist."

00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,957
My heart goes out to the members
of the African-American community...

35
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,078

have been kept down by the man.

I think it'd look more natural
if you talked to me instead of the camera.

It's something we work on
in acting class.

Interesting.

A few people in the Comments section
have said that my delivery is robotic.

Perhaps that isn't the compliment
it sounds like.

you could work on body language a bit.

you're shutting the audience out.

you're inviting them in.

it's to go where the wind takes you.

about the state flag?

...what did you have for breakfast,
a big glass of good question juice?

72

The Nebraska state flag
is simply the state seal on a field of blue.

since you did something nice for me...

171
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:52,588
...l'm obligated to do something
nice for you.

172
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:56,515
So, yes, I'll go to your dopey play.

173
00:10:57,999 --> 00:11:00,752
-Hey, I don't want you to go anymore.
-Why not?

174
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,115
Go because you want to,
not because you have to.

175
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,032
Oh, dear Lord, more rules.
Where does it stop?

176
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,474
Can I want to go
because I have to want to go?

177
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:14,751
-Okay, do whatever you want.
-Yeah, but, no, wait.

178
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,038
Do whatever I want
or whatever I have to want?

179
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,549
Oh, for God's sake, just come to the play.

180
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:23,788
All right.

181
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,030
I don't want to
but at least that makes sense.

182
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,150
You know, I haven't seen Raj
in several days.

183
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,674
Is he no longer a part of our social group?

184
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,918
And if so, should we be
interviewing for a replacement?

185
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,795
Perhaps this time we go Latin.

186
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:52,471
He's just decided
he's never leaving his apartment again.

187
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,915
Oh. Brilliant.
I've been itching to pull that trigger.

188
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,469
He's upset because
he can't get anywhere with women.

189
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:03,673
Would it help ifl gave him some pointers?

190
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,511
I'm just funning you. Ha, ha.

191
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,031
Hi. I don't know if you remember me
but I was here the other night at your party.

192
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:21,508
Oh, yeah, you left with Raj.

193
00:12:22,599 --> 00:12:24,954
LUCY: Yeah.
-You're the one?

194
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,674
Let me tell you something.

195
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,674
That guy you blew off
happens to be my best friend.

196
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,398
Okay? He was devastated.

197
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,073
Sorry.

198
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:35,752
Can you just give him this?

199
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,788
Okay.

200
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,919
But I gotta warn you,
Raj is a proud, passionate man.

201
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,072
lfyou go running out on him again...

202
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,915
...you're only gonna get like three or four
more chances before you are history.

203
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,593
Come on, she came back.
This is good news. You should celebrate.

204
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:57,556
I don't want to celebrate.

205
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,269
Not even a little?

206
00:13:04,439 --> 00:13:07,476
We could have a pants party.
Go put some on.

207
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,557
Why would I want her number?
I want nothing to do with this woman.

208
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,233
-Come on, Raj.
-You don't get it.

209
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,550
I want nothing to do with any woman.

210
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,517
My heart is stone.

211
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,758
From now on, I am a monk.

212
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,514
l renounce all worldly pleasures.

213
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,955
Except for lobster.

214
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,477
And garlic butter.

215
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,115
Boy, I wanna tell you it's her loss,
but you are not making it easy.

216
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:39,750
You're a good friend for trying to help,
but I've made my choice.

217
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:42,995
All right, well...

218
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,309
...l'll see you around.

219
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,153
See you.

220
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,719
No, wait.

221
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:50,154
Take her number.
I don't want the temptation.

222
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:52,312
Okay.

223
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,600
I must be strong so I don't stray from
my true purpose: the study of the universe.

224
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,153
All right.

225
00:14:07,439 --> 00:14:09,953
Thanks for ruining lobster for me.

226
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:16,715
RAJESH:
Wait! Give me the number!

227
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,632
Give me the number! Give me the number!

228
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,112
So, Amy, what's going on
with your addiction study?

229
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:29,347
Sadly I'm no longer associated
with that project.

230
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,318
-Why? What happened?
-Typical bureaucratic nonsense.

231
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,359
You can get animals addicted to a harmful
substance, you can dissect their brains...

232
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:40,273
...but you throw their own feces back at them
and suddenly you're unprofessional.

233
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,878
I'm sorry.

234
00:14:44,359 --> 00:14:46,077
That I asked.

235
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,675
All right, let's get this stupid play over with.

236
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,955
Uh, hang on. Empty your pockets.

237
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,918
-Why?
-You know why. The Nintendo DS.

239
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,469

Oh, for Pete's sake.

243
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,396
-Can we go now?
-Is that all of it?

244
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:23,717
Just set it down.

245
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,516
Just so you know,
this is not a stupid play.

246
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,875
A Streetcar Named Desire
is an American classic.

247
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,350
It's about streetcars?

248
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,589
Great. Then I won't need this.

249
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,753
Just a sec.

250
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:53,434
Oh, who says "just a sec"?
I hate myself.

251
00:15:57,999 --> 00:15:58,988
Hello.

252
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,515
-Hi.
-Uh, would you like to come in?

253
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,240
Uh, no, I can't stay.

254
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,833
Oh.

255
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,832
I just wanted to say...

256
00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:11,230
...l'm sorry for running out
of the coffee shop. That wasn't cool.

257
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,719
So yeah.

258
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:16,198
I'm sorry.

259
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,313
Wait.

260
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,673
Can you at least tell me what went wrong?

261
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,478
It's okay, I can take anything.

262
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,519
Unless it's something I did, or said, or am,
because those are like my buttons.

263
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,949
No, it's not any of that.

264
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,310
It's just, I kind of have a hard time
around people I don't know.

265
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,836
Really? Then what were you doing
at the comic book store that night?

266
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,316
I've been trying to force myself
into situations I'm not comfortable with.

267
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:51,039
I saw the flyer in the store window
and I made myself go in.

268
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,872
I don't even like comic books.

269
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,190
-Yeah, me neither.
-What were you doing there?

270
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,952
I lied. I love them.

271
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,674
I only said that so you'd go out with me.

272
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,273
You don't want to do that.

273
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,792
I'm kind of broken.

274
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,075
That's great. I'm broken too.

275
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,117
-No, you're not.
-I totally am.

276
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:12,954
If it wasn't for this beer, I couldn't even
talk to you right now. I'm a wreck.

277
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,839
There are many things
seriously wrong with me.

278
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,355
And not quirks either...

...like, diagnosable psychological problems.

Maybe brain damage.

00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,232
Well, how do I know
you're notjust saying that?

282
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:37,474
Go out with me on one date
and I promise you you'll see.

283
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,113
Okay.

00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:43,634
Text me.
Bye.

285
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:47,752
You won't regret it.
I'm the most pathetic guy you've ever met.

286
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,798
And that, boys and girls, is how it's done.

287
00:18:00,439 --> 00:18:02,794
You love her very much, don't you?

288
00:18:03,199 --> 00:18:04,552
Yes.

I think you have great capacity for devotion.

290
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,713
You will be lonely
when she passes on, won't you?

291
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,872
I understand what that is.

-She's pretty good, huh?

293
00:18:16,719 --> 00:18:17,947
She is.

about streetcars?
