1
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:06,477
I know you guys don't want to do this,
but we have no choice.

2
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:09,233
You can either bitch and whine
or we can get it over with.

3
00:00:09,399 --> 00:00:11,629
-I got whine.
-I got the B-word.

4
00:00:12,479 --> 00:00:15,630
Yeah, well, it's in our contract
to serve on a university committee.

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,109
And frankly,
this is one I believe in, okay? Here:

6
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:20,952
Encouraging more women
to pursue a career in the sciences.

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,713
Come on, if I was good
at convincing women to do stuff...

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,792
...I wouldn't have spent
so much of my 20's in the shower. Heh.

9
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:31,239
If you ask me,
this whole thing is a waste of our time.

10
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:34,197
-Helping women?
-Yeah, helping anyone.

11
00:00:35,199 --> 00:00:37,315
People should take care of themselves.

12
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:40,835
Oh, like yesterday when you
made me drive you to the dry cleaners...

13
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:42,671
...the pharmacy and the post office?

14
00:00:42,839 --> 00:00:45,194
I'm not saying people can't use tools.

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,680
Even an otter picks up a rock
when he wants a clam.

16
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,238
You don't think it's worthwhile to get
more women in science?

17
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,436
I think that's incredibly sexist of you.

18
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:00,109
I believe in a gender-blind society
like in Star Trek...

19
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,956
...where women and men of all races
and creeds work side by side as equals.

20
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:09,079
You mean where they were advanced
enough to invent an interstellar warp drive...

21
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,437
...but a black lady
still answered the space phone?

22
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:16,828
Oh, I did spend a lot of my shower time
with Lieutenant Uhura.

23
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,593
Howard's disturbing recollections aside...

24
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:24,997
...I don't appreciate being forced
to do banal committee work.

25
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,752
I know. You're too smart for this.

26
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,311
Exactly. It's like asking the Human Torch
to heat up your frozen burrito.

27
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,118
Got it. All right, I'm thinking one way
to counter bias in the peer-review process...

28
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,317
...is for papers to be submitted
under gender-neutral names...

29
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,471
...like S. Smith instead of Samantha Smith.

30
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,029
I suppose there is a history
of professional women...

31
00:01:44,199 --> 00:01:46,667
...using their initials
so as not to be pre-judged.

32
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,992
Harry Potter's J.K. Rowling,
uh, Star Trek's D.C. Fontana.

33
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,674
Van Nuys pole-dancer, D.D. Melons.

34
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,869
All right. I think we've really helped
women today. Let's fire up the Xbox.

35
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:03,429
Don't make this a school project
where I'm the smart kid doing the work...

36
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,396
...while the slackers sit and watch.

37
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,994
We're not. You're the smart kid
doing all the work...

38
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,515
...while the even smarter kids
sit back and watch.

39
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,591
So you think I'm one of the smarter kids?

40
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,593
No, you're a tool I was using
to make my point.

41
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,117
Guys, our topic is
"Encouraging Women in Science."

42
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:49,190
Can you at least play a less sexist game?

43
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:55,478
How is it sexist?

44
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,032
My character wields a battle ax
as well as any man.

45
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:03,590
Not to mention she has mammary glands
that could nurse a family of 30.

46
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,909
And have enough milk left over
to open a Baskin-Robbins.

47
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:13,472
Mother, warrior-princess, franchise owner...

48
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,438
...I hear glass ceilings shattering
all over town.

49
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,510
Sheldon, you're always saying
how much smarter you are than me.

50
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,673
Spend five seconds and come up with one
idea on how to get more women into science.

51
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,037
All your ideas address the issue
at a university level. By then it's too late.

52
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,749
You need to design a program that
targets girls at the middle-school level...

53
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:36,956
...and sets them on an academic track
towards the hard sciences.

54
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,315
That's actually good.
Why didn't I think of that?

55
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,760
Some people are otters,
some people are rocks.

56
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,554
I wonder if there's a way
we could give the idea a trial run.

57
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:56,551
I could call my old middle school, see if
we can talk to some of the female students.

58
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:59,279
Great. Try to set up something
for us to go over there.

59
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,237
Hold on. While I'm comfortable
speaking about science...

60
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,552
...l'm not sure I know how to spark the
interest of school children. Better Google it.

61
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,432
What exactly are you looking up?

62
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,434
"How do I get 12-year-old girls excited?"

63
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,272


64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,389
Thanks again for letting me crash
girl's night.

65
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,279
Are you kidding?
You brought fancy wine and made fondue.

66
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,510
I've slept with guys for less.

67
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:33,752
It's ajoke.

68
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,276
Based on real events.

69
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,198
Anyway, I was hoping
I could, uh, pick your brains a little.

70
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:43,908
I'm supposed to take Lucy out Friday
and I need a killer first date.

71
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,318
Evolutionary biology
says that women are attracted to a man...

72
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:51,757
...who is steady in the face of danger,
sol recommend an unsafe environment.

73
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:56,516
A seedy bar
on the wrong side of the tracks...

74
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,274
...a picnic near a lunatic asylum...

75
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:02,519
...a wine-tasting on skid row.

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,039
Lucy has some, uh, social anxiety issues,
we could start with something simpler.

77
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:11,191
Why don't you take her to Disneyland?

78
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,557
You go on Space Mountain,
you're in the dark, she's holding onto you.

79
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,711
That ride is shorter than you think...

80
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:20,713
...and they take a picture of you at the end,
so make sure you got your clothes on.

81
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:24,949
It's ajoke.

82
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,756
Based on real events.

83
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,714
Disneyland? I don't know.

84
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:32,757
With all the crowds
and the weird characters walking around...

85
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:34,796
...just reminds me too much of India.

86
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,958
I haven't been since I was a kid.
We should go one weekend.

87
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,314
Weekends are too crowded.

88
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,198
-So blow off work, go on a weekday.
-Hooky?

89
00:05:43,359 --> 00:05:45,429
I've never played hooky in my life.

90
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:49,433
My mom said that's how girls end up
addicted to reefer and jazz music.

91
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:53,827
More like how girls end up
at a Best Western hotel...

92
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,594
...with a 34-year-old guy named Luther.

93
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,471
-Joke?
-I can laugh about it now.

94
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:07,717
What do you say? This Friday
we ditch work and go to Disneyland?

95
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:09,995
-l'm in.
-Me too.

96
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,470
Excuse me, I thought we were
trying to solve my problem.

97
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:14,958
Oh, yeah, right.

98
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:17,189
Wait, what was your problem again?

99
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:21,438
I'm a man who can't talk to women, trying
to figure out how to go on a romantic date...

100
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,674
...with a girl who suffers from social
anxiety, she can't be around other people.

101
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,191
Yeah, that's a toughie.

102
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:32,474
Let's think.

103
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:41,757
Are we doing just Disney
or California Adventure too?

104
00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:48,598
It's nice of your old school to let us try out
our science talk on some female students.

105
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,672
They were actually pretty excited.
I'm their most famous alum.

106
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,991
If you don't count the serial killer
who ate all those prostitutes.

107
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:00,474
This must feel good for you, coming
back to your alma mater as an astronaut.

108
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,871
Yeah. Last time I was here
I was just a scrawny little nerd.

109
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:07,987
And now you're also an astronaut.

110
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:12,150
So many memories.
How many times in these hallways...

111
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,949
...was I tripped, punched and spit on? Heh.

112
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,350
Oh, look, here's my old locker.

113
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:20,749
l have a masters in engineering...

114
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:26,198
...I still can't figure out how Scott Kapinski
got me and my briefcase to fit in there.

115
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:32,798
-Hey.
-What?

116
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,473
Nothing.

117
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,270
Smart, we don't want any problems.

118
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,750
I can't believe I ditched work
for Disneyland.

119
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,193
What did you tell your boss?

120
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:47,395
Oh, I was very clever, I did it in stages.

121
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,074
At 7 last night I called
about a problem at the lab...

122
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,959
...and casually mentioned
I was going out for seafood.

123
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,639
At 9:30, I called and told him
that one of my scallops tasted weird.

124
00:07:57,799 --> 00:08:01,189
At 11:30, I called and said
I was throwing up like a fire hose.

125
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,632
At 12:45, I called and made nothing
but dry-heaving sounds.

126
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,030
And now I'm going to Disneyland!

127
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:12,112
Penny, what did you say?

128
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:15,430
I work at the Cheesecake Factory.
I said, "Bye."

129
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,952
So, what are we gonna do first?

130
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,318
I don't know about you, but I'm going to the
place that gives you a princess makeover.

131
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,469
Ooh, that sounds like fun.

132
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,109
You're kidding, right? We're notjust
gonna get drunk and go on rides?

133
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:31,116
Come on, do it with us.

134
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:33,474
Ah, all right, whatever. How does it work?

135
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:37,154
Okay, so you pick your princess,
Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Cinderella.

136
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,430
They give you hair, makeup, the works.

137
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,508
I guess it would be fun to be Cinderella.

138
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,716
-I want to be Cinderella too.
-Yeah.

139
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:46,949
We can't all be Cinderella.

140
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:51,153
Then how do we decide?

141
00:08:51,319 --> 00:08:55,312
Well, it's simple. This was my idea,
I'm driving, I'm Cinderella.

142
00:08:55,479 --> 00:08:58,676
You bitches got a problem with that,
we can stop the car right now.

143
00:09:10,999 --> 00:09:12,637
Excuse me.

144
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,792
I'm meeting a girl here.
It's kind of a first date.

145
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,276
In a library?

146
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,229
She and l are both a little awkward in social
situations so this seemed like a good idea.

147
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,949
Ah. People say I'm a little awkward too.

148
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,792
May I join you?

149
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,996
No, you can'tjoin us.

150
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,674
Go climb back up whatever beanstalk
you came down from.

151
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:44,592
You can do better.

152
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,156
Oh, we're eating here?

153
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,838
We're having a texting date?

154
00:10:03,359 --> 00:10:04,428
LUCY:
[love that.

155
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,629
RAJESH: As you're reading, it will help
to rememberlhave an adorable accent.

156
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:21,397
Okay, who's ready for some science?

157
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:26,756
Me too.

158
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:29,069
Okay, I am Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

159
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:34,075
I'm here with my friends, Dr. Cooper,
and real-life astronaut Howard Wolowitz.

160
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,995
And we are going to show you girls
how cool ajob in science can be.

161
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,309
How cool, you ask?

162
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,358
Well, how about negative 273 degrees...

163
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,432
...because that's the temperature at which

-So you just flew around?
