1
00:00:05,199 --> 00:00:06,268
What you doing?

2
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:09,317
You said clean up. I'm cleaning up, heh.

3
00:00:10,879 --> 00:00:12,915
You can't just throw everything
in the closet.

4
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:15,957
You can tell me what to do
or you can tell me how to do it...

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,192
...but you can't do both.
This isn't sex.

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,832
Well, what if someone looks in there?

7
00:00:22,999 --> 00:00:25,797
They're coming over for dinner,
no one will look in the closet.

8
00:00:25,999 --> 00:00:29,116
You don't know that. What if someone's
looking for the bathroom?

9
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,268
It could work out.

10
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:33,237
For all we know,
there's a toilet in there somewhere.

11
00:00:34,519 --> 00:00:37,079
Fine. After tonight,
we need to get a handle on this mess.

12
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,196
We should show the closet to Sheldon.

13
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:40,587
Why?

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,149
Ha. Are you kidding?
He's like a savant at organizing.

15
00:00:43,319 --> 00:00:45,435
Everything in his apartment
has a label on it...

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,309
...including his label maker,
which has a label that says "label maker."

17
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:54,678
If you look really close at that label-maker
label, you'll see a label that says "label."

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,432
No, he's our guest. We can't ask him
to straighten our closet.

19
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,397
No, we wouldn't ask him.

20
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,633
We'd just show him the closet and
let the goblins in his head take it from there.

21
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,595
HOWARD:
Hey, guys, come on in.

22
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:11,273
AMY: Hi.
-Ooh, it smells good.

23
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,192
Thanks. Sheldon, I know tonight's
the night you eat Thai food.

24
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,477
I went to the Asian market,
got the ingredients, made it from scratch.

25
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,471
Oh, you shouldn't have.

26
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,868
It was my pleasure.

27
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,075
No, you really shouldn't have.

28
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,191
I brought my own.

29
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:27,597
You stopped and got him takeout?

30
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,956
I had no choice.
He kept kicking the back of my seat.

31
00:01:31,199 --> 00:01:33,110
Sheldon, I've been cooking all day.

32
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,510
Well, now don't you feel silly?

33
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,469
Show him the closet.

34
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,196
These spring rolls are amazing.
Good job, Bernadette.

35
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:12,028
That's the takeout that Sheldon brought.

36
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,230
I'm sure they wouldn't have tasted nearly as
good if I hadn't tried your food first.

37
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,518
Howard, did you want your clothes
arranged seasonally or by color?

38
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,348
-Color's fine.
-Wrong, they'll be arranged seasonally.

39
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,070
Aren't you gonna spend
a little time with Amy?

40
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:35,592
Oh, it's okay, I'm used to it.

41
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,992
The other day at Whole Foods, he spent
an hour optimizing the cheese aisle.

42
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:41,228
And some thanks I got.

43
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,676
The assistant manager chased me out
with an artisanal salami.

44
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,989
His quirks just make you love him more.

45
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,519
Someone please agree with me.

46
00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:00,270
Come on. It's getting late. Time to go.

47
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:03,033
Oh! Five more minutes.

48
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,637
That's what you said five minutes ago.

49
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,836
Amy and Penny are already in the car,
move it.

50
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:11,036
How come I never get to do
anything I wanna do?

51
00:03:11,279 --> 00:03:14,237
If he really wants to stay and finish,
I can give him a ride home.

52
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,198
Please, Leonard. He said it's okay.

53
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,072
Sheldon, it's--
Wait, I can go home without you? Bye.

54
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:24,948
Howard, l have a few questions.

55
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,634
I found three bowling pins.

56
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:31,838
Now, do you juggle these
or are you missing seven?

57
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,869
-Juggle.
-You health nuts kill me.

58
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,712
Oh, my God, it's beautiful!

59
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,473

you found thejuggling pins I hid.

Now, a couple more items.

61
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:49,517
Howard, I found this letter
from your dad in a box.

62
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:53,388
-Based on content, it could either be filed--
-Wait, you opened this?

63
00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:56,437
I had to find out if it's
personal correspondence or memorabilia.

64
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:59,067
-Based on the content--
-I couldn't be less interested.

65
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:03,470
Now, come on, I'll take you home.

66
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:07,757
-Don't you want to know what's in it?
-lfl did, I would've opened it years ago.

67
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:11,187
The closet looks great.
Let's get out of here.

68
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,194
Can I bring this box of extra shirt buttons
to sort on the ride?

69
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,229
-Do whatever you want.
-Thanks.

70

Oh!

71
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:23,556
Great party.

72
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:30,389
When I first met Howard, he'd pull
his scrotum out of his shorts and say:

73
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,869
"Oh! I sat in gum."

74
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,789
What is your point?

75
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:43,430
It's kind of weird how grown up he is now.
Happily married, throwing dinner parties.

76
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:47,592
Really? You couldn'tjust say that?
You had to tell the scrotum story?

78
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,793
It was a nice change of pace,
not eating takeout around a coffee table.

79
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,078
We could throw a dinner party too.
Maybe even ask everyone to get dressed up.

80
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,391
Sure. Just, when you say "dressed up,"
you mean nice clothes, right?

81
00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:07,232
Not like capes and tights and crap.

82
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,468

-No.

84

-Howie, you okay?
-Yeah, I just couldn't sleep.

85
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,759
I told you you shouldn't
have espresso after dinner.

86
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,434
I know the little cups make you
feel big, but it's not worth it.

87
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,352
It's this stupid letter.

88
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,194
-Did you read it?
-No.

89
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:39,273
-You must be curious.
-Of course I'm curious.

90
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,877
I haven't seen the man
since I was a little kid.

91
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:46,798
And a letter shows up
on my 18th birthday.

92
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,029
What's that about?

93
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,627
Then why don't you read it?

94
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,559
Maybe he apologizes
or explains why he left.

95
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,392
He abandoned me and my mother.

96
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,111
Why does he deserve a chance
to explain anything?

97
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,872
I get that.

98
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,358
So, what do you wanna do with it?

99
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,394
Something I should've done
a long time ago.

100
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,072
Really? Are you sure?

101
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:12,638
Yep.

00:06:20,239 --> 00:06:21,308

00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:22,952

Neither one of us
is tall enough to reach that.

107
00:06:37,239 --> 00:06:39,150
I can't believe he set it on fire.

108
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,914
Yeah, just seeing that letter
really freaked him out.

109
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:46,391
And he was already having a tough day.
He accidentally wore my pants to work.

110
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:54,749
I don't know why he was upset.
They were bigger on him than me.

111
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,869
I'm really curious what's in that letter.

112
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,076
Me too, but I guess now we'll never know.

113
00:07:01,239 --> 00:07:03,434
You said Sheldon read it.
Why not ask him?

I can't do that. What kind of wife would I be
ifl didn't respect my husband's privacy?

to disseminate it freely.

example of quantum superposition...

and we don't tell you which one it is...

in a state of epistemic ambivalence.
