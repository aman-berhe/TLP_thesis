Oh, dear.

00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:08,438
Penny, have you been recording
shows on our DVR again?

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,599
-No.
-Answer honestly. This is not a trial.

4
00:00:13,239 --> 00:00:14,877
That will come later.

5
00:00:15,079 --> 00:00:16,990
Absolutely not.

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,077
Help me out here.
I can't afford another demerit.

7
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:25,748
Uh, maybe we were hacked. The Chinese
have been hacking everything lately.

8
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:30,638
Why would the Chinese make our DVR
record Paul Elan: Mall Cop?

9
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:33,787
I don't know.

That's funny everywhere.

11
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:39,749
-l'm deleting it.
-Hang on.

12
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:42,632
Maybe the Chinese
haven't finished watching it yet.

13
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,516
If you're trying to make space on the DVR...

14
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,553
...why don't you get rid of stuff
you've already watched? Like Alphas.

15
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:53,233
No, that's the season-two finale.
Quite the cliffhanger.

16
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:55,669
I'm gonna rewatch it
before season three starts.

17
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,711
There's no season three.
They canceled that show.

18
00:01:01,279 --> 00:01:04,237
Well, they can't cancel it.
It ended on a cliffhanger.

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,315

20
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,231
There are two dumplings left.
Want them?

21
00:01:08,399 --> 00:01:11,357
Dumplings? Don't you understand
what's going on here?

22
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,357
As a rule, no.

23
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,869
That show ended with all the residents
of New York either dead or unconscious.

24
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:20,309
Now I'll never know what happened.

25
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,278
Why don't you make up
your own ending?

26
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,630
Oh. Sure, what a wonderful idea.

27
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,758
And after that I'll make up my own rules
of oral hygiene...

28
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,912
...and instead of flossing,
I'll rub pudding on my gums.

29
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:33,752
I'm gonna get the number of
the Syfy Channel and give them what for.

30

Oh, please don't do that.

31
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,909
No. They can'tjust cancel
a show like Alphas.

32
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:40,110
They have to help the viewers let go.

33
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,709

I feel bad for whoever gets that phone call.

yelled at by crazy nerds...

a sci-fi channel.

with this security camera.

The optics are great.
It's got infrared technology.

42

And there's even a backup battery
when the power goes out.

43
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,317
Whatever. I can see my little princess
while I'm at work, right?

configure the software.

and found her blog.

00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,796
Cool. Anything juicy?

50
00:02:54,999 --> 00:02:58,036
She said she recently went
on a date with a guy named Roger.

51
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,916
And he's Indian.

52
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,916
And he's an astrophysicist too!

53
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,751
-You know what's going on, don't you?
-Yes.

54
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,635
Mommy was right. American girls are
sexually voracious devils.

55
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,911
I can't believe I have to explain this.
People change names on blogs...

56
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,795
...to protect their privacy. "Roger" is Raj.

it would be Gavin.

-No, I don't know ifl should.

she would've told me.

-lt's exactly what it's like. Keep reading.

Oh.... I think we were looking at creepy in the
rearview mirror when I put up that camera.

With all the TV Sheldon was talking about,
I had the greatest idea ever.

69
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,594
It blows away my idea for a Star Wars-
themed coffee shop called Brewbacca's.

70
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,594
You need to watch Buﬁy the Vampire Slayer.
The perfect show for the two of us.

71
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,713
It's got action and jokes and hot vampires
and romance. I cannot oversell this.

We have made a horrible mistake
regarding Alphas.

77

We need to uncancel it immediately.

...concerned about y'all

00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:15,152
I'm sorry you're upset.

87
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:20,831
Sheldon, sometimes people seek the comfort
of physical contact in moments like this.

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,479
I am not flying back to Texas

Okay. Well, what I think is going on here...

90
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:36,993
...is you have a pathological need
for closure.

91
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,155
Oh. That's nonsense.

92
00:05:39,359 --> 00:05:43,238
You tell me stories about your day
all the time. I don't care how they end.

93

You know, I might be able
to help you with this.

94
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:50,958
There's a field of behavioral neuroscience
that examines...

95
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,510
...ways to retrain your neural pathways
so stuff like this bothers you less.

96
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,319
But I just told you,
I don't have a problem with closure.

97
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:00,030
-You sure about that?
-Quite sure.

98
00:06:11,799 --> 00:06:12,788
That proves nothing.

-Thanks a lot.

101
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,828
-What's going on?
-I broke down and I read Lucy's blog.

102
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,033
In one of the entries she said when we
first met, I struck her as a little feminine.

103
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:35,194

Ahh. Jeez, why do you girls always want
to talk about things?

106
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,314
Listen to me, if she's writing about
your relationship, use it to your advantage.

107
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,472
-Rig the game.
-That doesn't seem fair.

108
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:52,957
Is it fair that girls like confident,
normal guys more than nervous weirdos?

109
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,390
No, it's not.
I've always thought that was unfair.

110
00:06:56,599 --> 00:07:00,638

and use it to get her pants off.

Why couldn't you say the blog is like...
