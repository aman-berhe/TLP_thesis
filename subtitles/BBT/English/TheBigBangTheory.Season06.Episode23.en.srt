00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,274
So anyway, last night on video chat, I spent,
like, 20 minutes just staring into Lucy's eyes.

2
00:00:08,439 --> 00:00:11,795
-That sounds romantic.
-It was, until I realized the screen had frozen.

3
00:00:13,479 --> 00:00:15,709
Still one of my top three dates of all time.

4
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,956
So we ever gonna hang out with this girl?

5
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:21,236
Ahh, I'd love that, but she's not
really comfortable around people.

6
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:25,870
Yeah, I used to be uncomfortable
around people, but then I learned atrick.

7
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,112
l pretend everyone I meet
is a beloved character from Star Trek.

8
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:32,673
How's that working for you?

9
00:00:32,839 --> 00:00:36,036
Oh, like a charm,
unnamed crewman in a red shirt.

10
00:00:37,319 --> 00:00:40,072
Leonard, I may have gotten you ajob.

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,713
-l have ajob.
-Yes, he does. He caters to my every whim.

12
00:00:45,319 --> 00:00:49,312
No, in a couple of weeks, Stephen Hawking's
team is sending an expedition...

13
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:52,516
...to the North Sea to test
hydrodynamic simulations of black holes.

14
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:56,558
One of their experimental physicists
dropped out and I recommended you.

15
00:00:57,319 --> 00:00:59,150
Well, do you really think I have a shot?

16
00:00:59,319 --> 00:01:02,755
Yeah, I've worked with Hawking,
I talked you up. He knows your research.

17
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,831
-I think this could happen.
-He kno--?

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,989
Wow.

19
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,311
Wait, now, but do you think
that's a good idea?

20
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:11,714
You know Star Trek.

21
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,953
Should a guy with no name
and a red shirt really go on an expedition?

22
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,273
Hey, don't discourage him.
This is a fantastic opportunity.

23
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:22,430
No one asked you, Uhura.

24
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:29,828
Would you like to hear a classic
Sheldon Cooper factoid?

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,638
-What do you think?
-Great.

26
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,351
I've been doing some reading
about vehicular safety.

27
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,354
Did you know that the highest number
of drowning accidents...

28
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:43,909
...happen on or around boats?

29
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,069
Interesting that you would bring that up
when I might go work on a boat.

30
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,073
Well, that's the thing about factoids,
they're interesting.

31
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,950
I know what you're doing.

32
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,636
You don't want me going on this trip
because you're afraid to be alone.

33
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,957
I'm not afraid to be alone.

34
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,155
On land.

35
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,951
On the sea, it would be terrifying.

36
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,270
Because of all the drowning.

37
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,115
-Sheldon.
-Fine, no more drowning talk.

38
00:02:14,279 --> 00:02:16,031
I'll change the subject.

39
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,513
Who do you think would win in a fight...

40
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,558
...you or a shark?

41
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,590
Look, I appreciate your signature blend of
concern for me and incredible selfishness...

42
00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:34,236
...but if I get the chance to do this, there's
nothing you can say that's going to stop me.

43
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,753
Very well.

44

have never been better.

doesn't change anything.

47
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,677
If you look carefully at Venus...

48
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,799
...you should be able to see
the International Space Station pass by.

49
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,838
Wow, your friend was actually up there?

50
00:03:24,999 --> 00:03:27,354
Yeah, he brought me back
a T-shirt that said:

51
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,558
"My Friend Went to the Space Station
and All I Got Was This Lousy T-shirt."

52
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:34,151
Did he take the T-shirt to space?

53
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,709
Nope. It's exactly as lousy as advertised.

54
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:41,715
Speaking of friends,
they have been asking to meet you.

55
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,512
l was thinking maybe
we could all hang out sometime?

56
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,398
I don't know, how many are there?

57
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:49,835
Let's see. Six.

58
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:52,194
That's pretty cool. I have six friends.

59
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,111
I'm kind of like Sinatra.

60
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,679
Six strangers, that's a lot of pressure.

61
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,913
Staring at me, asking me
personal questions like, "What do you do?

62
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,478
Where are you from? Why did you
lock yourself in the bathroom?"

63
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,879
Okay, how about you just
dip your toe in and meet one of them?

64
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,669
-Will you be there?
-Of course.

65
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,991
Well, that's two. Three if you count me.
This is getting out of hand.

66
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,116
So then, during my afternoon shift,
I spilled an entire tray of drinks on myself.

67
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,999
-Oh, that's awful.
-Not really. My shirt was soaking wet.

68
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,310
I got, like, the biggest tip of my life.

69
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:38,916
So listen, do you remember
when I said the similarities...

70
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,798
...of the equations of general relativity
and hydrodynamics...

71
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:46,157
...suggest you could find the equivalent
of Unruh radiation in a large body of water?

72
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,830
I thought I said that to you.

73
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:58,354
Anyway, Stephen Hawking's team is looking
into that, and I've been invited to join them.

74
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:00,908
Wow, Hawking. Good for you.

75
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:04,037
Well, it is,
just, you know, I'd be gone for a while.

76
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:06,269
-Well, how long?
-Three, four months.

77
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,198
Whoa.

78
00:05:08,359 --> 00:05:10,634
-When would you leave?
-Couple of weeks.

79
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,669
Wow.

80
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,877
-Okay, well, I'll just come visit you.
-That's the thing, you can't.

81
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,951
I'll be on a ship in the North Sea.

82
00:05:18,119 --> 00:05:21,748
On a ship? Aren't they afraid
Hawking will just roll overboard?

83
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,954
He's not gonna be there. He's just
sending a team to research his theory.

84
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,159
Oh, sure. Like when you send me
to kill spiders in your bathtub.

85
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,793
Oh. Okay. So four months.

86
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:39,153
Yeah.

87
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:43,073
And I'm a little worried because
things between us have been so great...

88
00:05:43,239 --> 00:05:45,958
...and I'd hate to do anything
that screws that up.

89
00:05:46,119 --> 00:05:47,711
If you're gonna screw things up...

90
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:50,598
...it's gonna be while you're here,
not while you're away.

91
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,796
I mean, look, you have to go.
It sounds like an amazing opportunity.

92
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,509
And I'm just basing that on how much
I didn't understand what you said about it.

93
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,715
Okay. I'll confirm the travel arrangements
in the morning.

94
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,355
Okay, good.
