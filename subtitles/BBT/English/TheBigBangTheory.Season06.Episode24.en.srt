1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,794
Oh.

2
00:00:04,999 --> 00:00:08,196
Well, the holographic principles suggest
that it's possible...

3
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:11,954
...that our lives are reallyjust
acting out a painting...

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,554
...on the largest canvas in the universe.

5
00:00:15,319 --> 00:00:20,154
-What?
-Sometimes I forget how smart you are. Heh.

6
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,108
What are you doing?

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,633
Take off your clothes.

8
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:31,396
-What? Here? Now?
-You got a problem with that?

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,198


10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,476
-We did it in there.
-Yeah, we did.

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,955
MAN:
Big Bang Theory season six cast interviews.

12
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:43,148
Count and mark.

13
00:00:43,999 --> 00:00:45,751
-Whoo-hoo.
-Are we rolling? Oh.

14
00:00:45,959 --> 00:00:47,187
[BOTH LAUGH]

15
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,914
I've always said this when they ask
about Leonard and Penny.

16
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,550
It's mirrored a real relationship,
it is a little up and down.

17
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,352
They've broken up,
they're best friends...

18
00:00:56,519 --> 00:00:59,158
...and, you know, they've dated,
and they've dated other people.

19
00:00:59,319 --> 00:01:02,311
Their friends are each other's friends,
and it's a complicated relationship.

20
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,913
And there's deep, true love
for each other, you know.

21
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:06,398
Good morning, sunshine.

22
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:08,358
Leonard...

23
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:09,668
...it's 8 am.

24
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,757
It's like the middle of the night.

25
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,719
I like that it hasn't been this fairy tale story.

26
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:17,757
I feel like they're in a good place now.
I'm afraid to say that out loud.

27
00:01:17,919 --> 00:01:19,432
Don't say that.
What is wrong with you?

28
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,309
We'll read the script for the last episode
of the season tomorrow...

29
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,118
-...and that could just be-- Yeah.
-Done.

30
00:01:26,559 --> 00:01:29,119
-Look, there's something I need to tell you.
-Just say it.

31
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:33,237
-Okay. Here goes.
-Mm-hm.

32
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,150
You slept with him?

33
00:01:41,679 --> 00:01:46,150
I laugh because I still don't know,
every script I get, if we're together or not.

34
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,555
-lt's kept me on my toes.
-Sometimes it's hard to tell.

35
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:49,913
CUOCO:
Yeah.

36
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,755
Even though their relationship is on and off,
they've been in a relationship for a long time.

37
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,832
I think it's matured the show as a whole.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,989
Definitely matured, yeah.

39
00:01:58,199 --> 00:02:01,430
There are much more adult issues.

40
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:04,432
I don't mean that in a risquÃ© way,
whatsoever.

41
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,830
I'm here to support my man, just like you.

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,035
What are you going to do?

43
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,838
The characters are growing up.

44
00:02:15,999 --> 00:02:18,274
They're growing up
and it's just kind of a natural thing.

45
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,477
Although, I still never saw all these
characters in these deep relationships.

46
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:23,630
But itjust happened naturally...

47
00:02:23,799 --> 00:02:26,711
...and, you know, now there's
so many fun things to play with that.

48
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,313
It's just happened really beautifully.

49
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:35,111
-Hi, I'm Penny.
-Alex.

50
00:02:35,279 --> 00:02:37,634
-Do you work with Dr. Hofstadter?
-In a way.

51
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,752
We've kind of been involved
in a five-year experiment.

52
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:46,832
Well, you're lucky, he seems very talented.
I'm sure a lot of people wanna work with him.

53
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:49,832
Oh, well, a lot of people can't, so....

54
00:02:49,999 --> 00:02:52,308
Penny got a little jealous.

55
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:56,834
I think it's important for Leonard
to learn his street value once in a while...

56
00:02:56,999 --> 00:02:58,751
...out there on the market.

57
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,949
[LAUGHS]

58
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,354
I know she hit on you
and I know you liked it.

59
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,350
What?

60
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,909
I like that they made it
Penny getting jealous this time, you know.

61
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,354
Because Leonard's
usually the one.

62
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,876
-Gets very threatened.
-Yes.

63
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,439
I don't care about Alex.

64
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,674
Fine, I care.

65
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,359
Okay, I hate that bitch.

66
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,110
He kind of--
He had a little bit of an ego about it.

67
00:03:20,279 --> 00:03:23,157
-You were a little too excited.
-Which in the end was probably healthy...

68
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:26,311
...to bring back into our relationship.

69
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:33,477
Obviously,
I have some commitment issues.

70
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,557
Glaringly obvious. Go on.

71
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,998
As long as things keep going great,
you'll keep asking me to marry you...

72
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:41,115
...and eventually,
I'm gonna end up saying yes.

73
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:44,635
Then we're gonna be married forever
and the whole thing just freaks me out.

74
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,677
First of all, it's one of my favorite
Leonard lines ever, that:

75
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,432
CUOCO & GALECKI:
"I knowl propose a lot."

76
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,628
[LAUGHS]

77
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,836
So he says, "I'm not gonna propose."
She goes, "Are you breaking up with me?"

78
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:55,951
It's like saying,
"Are you calling me fat?"

79
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,275
His solution was to say,
"I'm not gonna ask.

80
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,873
I'm gonna take my desires
out of the equation.

81
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,674
You tell me when you're ready."

82
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,392
Which I thought was really beautiful.

83
00:04:04,559 --> 00:04:06,197
It's all on you.

84
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:08,998
I gotta tell you, when the time comes,
I want the whole nine yards.

85
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:12,310
I want you down on one knee, flowers.
I wanna be swept off my feet.

86
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,228
Okay.

87
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,828
GALECKI: I loved that scene.
CUOCO: I did too. It's so cute.

88
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:21,998
That's unconditional love.
That's selflessness, you know.

89
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,913
You guys are like family to me,
you know that, right?

90
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,277
-That's great. Get out.
-What? Why?

91
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,556
Penny and l have some issues
we need to talk about.

92
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,280
Oh, pish on your issues.

93
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,193
After everything
you've been through...

94
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:44,557
...you get to look into each other's eyes
and say "I love you."

95
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,875
And that's beautiful.

96
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,755
Actually, to this day,
she's never really said it.

97
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,071
Oh, Penny, that's ridiculous.

98
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,792
Well, in the episode where
Penny drops the L bomb...

99
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,757
GALECKI: Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
-...the "I love you"...

100
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,558
...it's a very special scene
and it comes out of nowhere.

101
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,153
It comes out of her frustration...

102
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,555
-...since you keep being so needy.
-True.

103
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,869
Why do you always do this?

104
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:09,631
Listen to me, you're the one I'm with.

105
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,829
You knowl love you.

106
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,473
So will you please relax
because you're driving me crazy.

107
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,072
ltjust comes flying out of her mouth.

108
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,789
She doesn't know that she said it. And
it's a little bit of an elephant in the room.

109
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,916
But it's wonderful. I think she's always--

110
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,311
-She's always known that she loves him.
-Yes, she just hasn't said the word.

111
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:27,753
She's a bit
of a commitment-phobe.

112
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,069
Remember first time you said it,
she said, "Thank you."

113
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,718
Right. Oh, I remember.

114
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,399
-That was a rough one.
-Mm-hm.

115
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,630
And you kept coming back.

116
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,592
Leonard's a fighter.

117
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,193
-He's a fighter, man.
-He doesn't give up.

118
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,713
GALECKI:
He's got a stubborn heart.

119
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:43,949
That's the first time you ever said
that you love me.

120
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,873
Yeah.

121
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,389
Well, it's cool because we only did that
in one take in front of the audience...

122
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:53,918
...and that was it.

123
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:56,547
I looked at Johnny,
I'm like, "Did that feel the same for you?"

124
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,350
Like, I literally felt like I had become Penny
at that moment. It sounds so corny.

125
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,557
I felt like ljust became Penny.
I didn't even see an audience.

126
00:06:04,719 --> 00:06:08,075
-There was no one but Leonard and Penny.
-Everything and everyone kind of fell away.

127
00:06:08,239 --> 00:06:09,957
It felt like
one of the most real moments...

128
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,314
-...like, I've ever had.
-Yeah.

129
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:14,198
You're about to make me cry...

130
00:06:14,359 --> 00:06:17,635
...and we both know ifl start crying,
you're gonna start crying.

131
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,395
-You're right, you should go.
-All right.

132
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,477
We just were totally
in Leonard and Penny world.

133
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,869
l was no one else but her at that moment.
It was strange.

134
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,077
It did. It felt like we were the only
two people in the room. That's exactly--

135
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:31,752
That's what you strive for on stage.

136
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,758
But especially with all of this,
all this technical--

137
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:37,717
I mean, 500 people in the room,
it's really hard to achieve that.

138
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,031
So, yeah, we did it once
and never looked back.

139
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:42,468
I love you.

140
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,428
I love you too.

141
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,998
I think we'd both like to see them
end up together. I mean, I think--

142
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,269
-Yes.
-Boy.

143
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,670
That would be tragic
after all they've been through.

144
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:53,431
I would cry like it was my own breakup.

145
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,157
-Yeah.
-I don't think I could handle it.

146
00:06:55,359 --> 00:06:57,919
Whatever path these two choose,
I want them to end up together.

147
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:00,388
GALECKI: Yeah.
-I want them to end up married, I really do.

148
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:02,515
That's like my dream for these characters.

149
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,399
And lthink-- We deserve that
because we haven't played it like that.

150
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:07,914
Like, it's gone back and forth,
we've broken up, we've--

151
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,273
There's been so many things.

152
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,637
-Yeah, the characters have earned it.
-Yeah. It's not like, "Oh, that's typical."

153
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:15,677
If they walk away after
all this empty-handed, good Lord.

154
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,273
I would cry my eyes out. I would die.

155
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:19,669
-You'd cry through the entire episode.
-Oh, I would die.

156
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,068
[LAUGHS]

157
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:38,954
You don't know what it's like
to feel completely frustrated.

158
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,956
To have a desire build up within you...

159
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:44,435
...and then be denied any opportunity
for release.

160
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:50,992
Yeah, sounds like adrag.

161
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,432
MAN:
Sound speed.

162
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,673
Three camera, common mark.

163
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,437
-I like your glasses.
-Thank you.

164
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,231
I like them too.
They wouldn't work for me.

165
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:06,236
Might work for me.
Give me those glasses. Sorry.

[BOTH LAUGHING]

167
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,030
I've heard the comment
several times this year...

168
00:08:11,239 --> 00:08:16,074
...that there's a more "emotional element"
to some of the stories.

169
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,474
And I guess that's true.

170
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,150
Amy,
are you worried that us living together...

171
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,675
...will take the mystery
out of our relationship?

172
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,997
-No.
-Yeah. Why would you?

173
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,351
I think it's deeper
in terms of learning about you.

174
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,393
-lt's like variations of the same.
PARSONS: That's what I was gonna say.

175
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,749
I feel like the evolution has been--
There's not--

176
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,679
It's not this, it's this,
with these little things in there.

177
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:41,029
And that's been great, though...

178
00:08:41,239 --> 00:08:43,514
...because those are movements
that are more true to life.

179
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,280
-They feel huge.
BIALIK: Sure.

180
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:51,468
How was work today?

181
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:53,789
Did you exchange your research
with Kripke?

182
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,797
I read his research...

183
00:08:55,999 --> 00:09:00,675
...and it's leaps and bounds ahead of mine.

184
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:04,269
Sheldon, I wish there was something
I could do to make you feel better.

185
00:09:04,479 --> 00:09:05,798
May I offer you a consoling hug?

186
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,433
What do we have to lose?

187
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,556
BIALIK:
For me, I think--

188
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,671
This is not hard to pull off
because I adore Jim.

189
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:20,634
I think that this Amy character
is completely enamored with Sheldon...

190
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:23,637
...and I think in the sweetest
and most reasonable way.

191
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,194
lfeel like I'm being strangled
by a boa constrictor.

192
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,150
Why'd you stop?

193
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:35,235
You know, from all the kind of, like, funny
comments about his sallow complexion...

194
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,476
-...and, you know, his hunched over--
-Watch it.

195
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,319
Ha-ha-ha.
I didn't write that. They did.

196
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:43,670
Um, no, but I think for all his quirks,
I think they're all forgivable.

197
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,871
Think about it, Sheldon.
Your personality quirks...

198
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:47,671
...which others find abhorrent
or rage-inducing...

199
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,909
...I find cute as a button.

200
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,471
-She doesn't have a lot of other options.
-Well....

201
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:55,671
But still, there's something very attractive
about their relationship.

202
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,908
In many ways, it is one of the most stable
relationships on the show...

203
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,078
...certainly until Wolowitz and Bernadette
got married...

204
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,191
...which I think solidifies things.

205
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,675
Well, who knows in today's society?
No. Um, but....

206
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,108
There's a real understanding...

207
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,919
...between the two of them
of where they stand.

208
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,680
You know, when l have afeeling, I know it.

209
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,233
And trains? Love them.

210
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,636
Hand-holding? Not a fan.

211
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:25,834
There's a very literal "I sacrifice this for you.
I sacrifice this for you. l--"

212
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,759
I mean, it's back and forth constantly
with the two of them.

213
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:33,909
It allows them a certain detachment
from their feelings on the issues.

214
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,079
And when a bump comes up for this couple,
they communicate and work it out.

215
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,669
-But we didn't finish.
-Exactly.

216
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,429
It's not the way anybody you've ever met
communicates and works things out...

217
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,393
...but it works for them
and they're both honest with each other.

218
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,797
It's, I guess, the basis
of a good long-term relationship, right?

219
00:10:50,999 --> 00:10:52,557
I like Mayim too. I should throw that in.

220
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,600
-l'm fond of you and so--l know.
-It took you three minutes though.

221
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,916
I do think that's definitely a part
of our relationship.

222
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,872
I, as Jim, enjoy having Mayim in my life.

223
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,355
-Sheldon, can I ask you a question?
-Well, of course.

224
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,834
Are you ever gonna sleep with Amy?

225
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,157
All right, we're down the rabbit hole.
What are you doing?

226
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,993
I don't know another relationship
that's been this long-term, stable...

227
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,752
...and intimate
without being consummated.

228
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,234
-I think it's really kind of sweet and amazing.
PARSONS Yeah.

229
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,069
And it's not the focal point of our plot lines
or of our relationship.

230
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,635
-It comes up. It comes up here and there.
-Sex, it comes up.

231
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,798
But it's kind of like,
we're so far from that, like--

232
00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:27,149
-We clearly have a lot going besides doing it.
-Exactly.

233
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,475
I know it doesn't seem like it to you...

234
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,151
...but, for me,
what we have is extremely intimate.

235
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:36,509
I guess I know that.

236
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,556
It's just, like, part of me wants more.

237
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,637
More?

238
00:11:42,999 --> 00:11:46,275
I mean, look at us, it's only been three years.
Here we are in bed together.

239
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:49,233
BIALIK:
And I think that's sweet.

240
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:52,078
It doesn't have to be this catastrophic
relationship...

241
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,077
-Right.
-...or pinnacle that we're balancing on.

I'll send you a PDF.

where Amy was jealous of Alex and--

Is that the one
where I'm marking your office...

-...with my scent?
PARSONS: With your body? Yes.

254
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:32,192
I think that's so indicative...

-...of how these relationships work.
-Yeah.

how to deal with potential drama and threat.

-You're exactly right.
-That was worth half an episode.

258

-Yep.
-Because you would have said:

00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,678
-"What would I do with her?"
-Right.

I planned to pretend to enjoy it.

265

-Well, the table reading had us kissing.

-Oh, okay, we had a kiss.
-Right.

That was a wicked episode for Amy.

294
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,117
That was definitely
the most relationship-y thing she's done...

295
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,949
...in terms of some of those darker,
you know, aspects of relationships.

296
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:37,468
Here's the deal.
I don't need your medicine. I'm not sick.

297
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:41,911
-So you've just been lying?
-See the stuff in my nose? Rubber cement.

298
00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:45,270
I don't mean to be judgy,
but this is the kind of thing lunatics do.

299
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,753
-But it was so--
-But the motive was--

300
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:49,711
-You can say it.
-The motivation was so pure.

301
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,871
That was so loving, you know?

302
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,432
-She wanted to be with him.
-Yes.

303
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,517
-She wanted to be touched...
-It worked.

304
00:14:55,719 --> 00:14:58,438
...and dealt with by him in a way that,
under normal circumstances...

305
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,359
...he would only do if she was in peril
in some sort of way.

306
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:03,470
BIALIK:
Well, you have to meet him where he's at.

307
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,147
And lthink, like,
that's a lesson we all could learn, right?

308
00:15:06,359 --> 00:15:07,951
You have to meet people where they're at.

309
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:12,271
Now, you may notice some tingling.

310
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,955
Oh, I'm counting on it.

311
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,118
Again, this is where our relationship works,
right?

312
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,470
-You play to the other person's sense...
PARSONS: Yeah.

313
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,108
...ofjustness and rightness...

314
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,880
...I guess for as much benefit,
you know, personal benefit...

315
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,876
-...and pleasure as you can.
-Sure.

316
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,434
It hurts that you would lie to me, Amy.

317
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,200
I thought our relationship
was based on trust...

318
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:37,187
...and a mutual admiration
that skews in my favor.

319
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,760
Another great example
of us communicating very clearly.

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,995
-Absolutely.
-Sheldon's saying, "That's not okay.

321
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,713
-We need to do something about it."
-Yup.

322
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,195
-You gotta be punished.
-And Amy's saying, "Okay. Oh, okay."

323
00:15:47,359 --> 00:15:50,669
-There it was. Nothing we need to repeat.
-It was Sheldon's suggestion to spank you.

324
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,233
BIALIK: I know.
-I don't want to...

325

why he wants-slash-needs Amy in his life.

that it's better to have her...

329
00:16:04,999 --> 00:16:06,671
-...than to not have her around.
-Yep.

330
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:10,713
And I will say, because we enjoy
working together so much...

331
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:15,675
...and because it has brought such joy
in the acting of the scenes together...

332
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:19,428
...I would really hope
that they not stop this relationship...

333
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:22,073

or whatever.

-Don't go suggesting it.
-Oh, God. No, I mean--

a "final scene of Grease" scene...

-What does that mean?

and heels with curly hair.

RAUCH: You know, one thing I love
about these writers...

355
00:17:39,479 --> 00:17:44,269
...is that they're always having us discover
a new layer and I love getting their scripts...

356
00:17:44,479 --> 00:17:47,357
...to see another side of the character
that maybe wasn't there before.

357
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:50,869
The course of the show
I would say is vastly different.

would've suspected my character...

368
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:17,958

He just kept on playing that stupid game.

of coming into her own marriage...

388

she's not the only Mrs. Wolowitz around...

RAUCH: You know, when Howard
spends his money on the printer...

398
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,275
...it's something that in his old world
wouldn't necessarily be something...

399

...that the whip would've been cracked on.

400
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,990
And I think that's also a part
of navigating marriage...

401
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,350

what your shared finances...

pretty much.

Something that I also find that's
just so great about their relationship...

421
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,234
...and how the writers write them
is you see the love between them...

422
00:20:53,439 --> 00:20:56,715
...and I mean, the episode
where Howard finds the letter from his father.

423

I read that episode,
and was crying on my couch.

that was so beautifully written.

to explain anything?

-Yup.

of a true marriage.

He's going through it
but bringing his wife along for the ride...

433
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,998
...and she's as invested
in the situation as he is.

434
00:21:27,199 --> 00:21:29,110

I think it's very true to marriage...

435
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,919
...that it's you and your spouse
against the world.

436
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:35,429

00:24:31,439 --> 00:24:33,953
They're very lonely, and in their loneliness,
they found each other.

489
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,833
So you guys are, like, buds now?

490
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,711
Oh, yeah. We hang out all the time.

491
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:41,308
Plus, he doesn't have a girlfriend,
I don't have a girlfriend.

492
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:45,392
It's like we both had these holes in our lives,
but now we fill each other's holes.

493
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:51,118
Stuart and him talk about comic books.
They can talk about video games.

494
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,912
There's no social pressure to be on.

495
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,678
You and l have so much fun hanging out.

496
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,559
If you were a girl,
all our problems would be solved.

497
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:01,196
NAYYAR: Short of actually wanting
to make love to a man...

498
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:03,867
-What?
-...Raj really would love Stuart...

499
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,071
...to be his sort of life companion.

500
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:07,473
Cheers.

501
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,875
He loves women.
As you can tell in seasons leading up...

502
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,799
...he's always been-- He fancied himself
when he's drunk a womanizer.

503
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,356
And Raj is not shy to tell you
what kind of women he likes, as we all know.

504
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,868
They must be insanely hot.

505
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,914
Like nines or tens.

506
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,678
Nines or tens?

507
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,108
Okay, an eight is acceptable...

508
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,232
...if she's willing to bring another eight
to the hot tub.

509
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,790
Bottom line,
you'll take any woman who'll have you.

510
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,149
In a New Delhi minute.

511
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,550
He's just naive,
which is really fun to play a character.

512
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,109
It's very freeing to play someone so naive.

513
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,832
Hey, Stuart, you got anything going on...

514
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,592
-...for Valentine's Day?
-Not really.

515
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,155
Other than hiding all the sharp objects
around here...

516
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:52,715
...and white-knuckling it till morning.
What do you got going on?

517
00:25:53,439 --> 00:25:55,953
Oh, well, I was gonna spend the night
with my special little lady...

518
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:59,835
...but she got worms
and then I had to take her to the vet.

519
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:02,827
On the Valentine's Day episode,
Raj had nothing to do.

520
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,554
So he told Stuart, "Why don't we throw
a Valentine's Day party...

521
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,354
...for the people who don't have
anything to do on Valentine's Day."

522
00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:11,877
And when the party starts,
no one's having a good time.

523
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,832
Everyone's feeling bummed
about being lonely.

524
00:26:13,999 --> 00:26:16,274
Then Raj gets up there
and gives the speech of a lifetime...

525
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,391
...about, you know,
"We're not pathetic people."

526
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,556
We are a community.

527
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,833
And as long as we have each other,
we're never truly alone.

528
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,551
NAYYAR: And after that speech,
Lucy walks up to him and says:

529
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,671
That was cool, what you said.

530
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,269
-You really think so?
-Yeah, I do.

531
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,517
And he basically is like, "Later, losers."
He's, like, whatever and leaves.

532
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,757
But, you know, Lucy is interesting for Raj
because he's finally met someone...

533
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,110
...who has more social anxiety than he does.

534
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,639
I'm kind of broken.

535
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,592
That's great. I'm broken too.

536
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,472
-Oh, no, you're not.
-Oh, I totally am.

537
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,353
There are many things seriously wrong
with me.

538
00:26:52,879 --> 00:26:55,154
NAYYAR:
And that, I think, puts him in a position...

539
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,316
...where he's the one
taking care of someone...

540
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,318
...and that helps him bring his guard down...

541
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:02,316
...where he's not so self-conscious...

542
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:04,589
...because he's met someone
who is, you know....

543
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,471
She just has some more issues
than he does.

544
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,312
And he finds her very attractive.

545
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,312
Uh-oh.

546
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,358
Hey, Raj...

547
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,471
...funny story.

548
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,148
The first date, he thought the library
would be the perfect spot...

549
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,555
...so he wouldn't be forced
to talk to her without alcohol.

550
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:24,590
RAJ ES H :
As you're reading, it will help to remember...

551
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,029
...I have an adorable accent.

552
00:27:27,239 --> 00:27:30,515
Raj is trying to find ways
so that Lucy feels comfortable.

553
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,472
Confronting someone
or pushing her boundaries.

554
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:37,039
Maybe I could do one more scary thing
before I go...

555
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:38,558
...and give you a kiss goodbye?

556
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:40,998
You know, if that's okay.

557
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,950
Panic attack. Maybe next time.

558
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,071
I'm counting that as foreplay.

559
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,315
I think Lucy would make a great mate
for him...

560
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:57,228
...because when he's in a position
where he's taking control of the situation...

561
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,431
...I feel like he puts that
on the other person...

562
00:27:59,639 --> 00:28:02,278
...as opposed to himself,
and that's a good relationship for him...

563
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,113
...because A, he lets his guard down,
which is very important.

564
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,756
And B, he feels
like he's the one nurturing, you know...

565
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,794
...as opposed to being self-conscious
about someone having to take care of him.

566
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,314
What's...? What is wrong with me?

567
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,556
Why can't I ever have love?

568
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:25,353
-You will.
-No, l--

569
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:28,232
Well, I'm unlovable.

570
00:28:28,439 --> 00:28:30,430
That's just the booze talking.

571
00:28:30,639 --> 00:28:31,913
No, it's not.

572
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:34,713
I haven't had a drink since last night.

573
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:41,908
-You're talking to me?
-I am.

574
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,155
[GASPS]

575
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,911
And now I'm crying
for a whole different reason.

576
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,269
Oh, me too.

577
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,236
ljust-- I want him to find love.

578
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:52,589
I mean, everyone else has,
and they've all deserved it.

579
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,471
I wanna see him succeed
in whatever he does.

580
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:58,673
You know, I'd love to see him
let his guard down and find love.
