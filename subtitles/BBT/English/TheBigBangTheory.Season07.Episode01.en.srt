00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,034
Whenever we see an iceberg,
we take a shot!

170
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,357
ALL (CHANTING): Berg! Berg!
Berg! Berg! Berg! Berg!

171
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,317
Leonard? Leonard?
(SCOFFS)

172
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,949
I cannot believe we
were missing that jerk.

173
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:13,597
You were.

174
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,033
So what happened?
How'd it go?

175
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,629
It's fine. I thanked them again and
let them know we're not available.

176
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,594
So I can drink this without having
to give up the goodies?

177
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,916
Yes, it's all cool.

178
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,829
Although, if you wanted to talk to
one of them, no one would blame you.

179
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,393
And why would no one blame me?

180
00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:38,594
I don't know what I'm saying.

181
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,634
Well, it sounds like you're saying
that I could do better than Sheldon.

182
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,831
Boy, these drinks are strong!

183
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,308
Oh, Mama, I'm gonna be
hugging the toilet tonight!

184
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,755
No, tell me. I want to know
what you meant by that.

185
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,076
ljust meant that you're not married,

186
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,068
and your boyfriend's
kind of... Sheldon.

187
00:11:04,239 --> 00:11:08,198
And your husband is extremely Howard.
What's your point?

188
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,795
Sorry, I have no point.
That was a stupid thing to say.

189
00:11:12,999 --> 00:11:14,830
Can we please just go back
to having a nice time?

190
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,237
We could, but unfortunately
my brain is lesion-free

191
00:11:18,439 --> 00:11:21,829
and I remember that rotten thing
you just said about my sweet baboo.

192
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,713
Come on, I apologize.
Can we please just let it go?

193
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,873
-Sure.
-Than ks.

194
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,390
Your husband's weird
and his clothes are ridiculous.

195
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,388
I can't believe it! All this time
I've been doing nothing

196
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,239
but sit around and miss that guy.
And you know what the worst part is?

197
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:45,036
That you're having to process
your emotional pain without vodka?

198
00:11:49,319 --> 00:11:50,672
No.

199
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,679
Yeah.

200
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,072
But you know what
the second-worst part is?

201
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:00,353
-He does not miss me at all.
-Allow me to comfort you.

202
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,915
At least you've got your health.

203
00:12:05,999 --> 00:12:07,830
Really? That's it?
That's comforting?

204
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:09,987
Um...

205
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,756
In a hundred years, you'll both
be dead and it won't matter?

206
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,437
No! Come on! You're supposed to say,
"Of course he misses you.

207
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,234
The only reason he's partying
is to cover up his pain."

208
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,715
Oh, no, I don't think
that's true at all.

209
00:12:27,439 --> 00:12:28,554
This is ridiculous.

210
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,990
Why am | upset just because
he's off having a good time?

211
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:35,556
Well, perhaps you're
obsessively picturing him

212
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:39,035
engaged in drunken coitus
with another woman.

213
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:44,828
Is that it?
Did I get it right?

214
00:12:46,999 --> 00:12:49,593
Okay, that's great. You can stop
trying to make me feel better now.

215
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,233
Actually, I can't.

216
00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:54,590
Before Leonard left, he made me
promise that I'd take care of you.

217
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,075
-He did?
-Yes.

218
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,555
Oh! That's really sweet.

219
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,389
Plus, if I do a good job, he said
he'd bring me back a sailor's cap.

220
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,632
Well, now! miss him even more.

221
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:12,231
Well, if it's any consolation,
I'm sure Leonard's tormented

222
00:13:12,439 --> 00:13:17,149
every moment he's away from your
warm embrace and cherry lips.

223
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,268
-Thanks.
-Oh! Seriously?

224
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,514
-Excuse me, Mrs. Davis?
-What?

225
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:30,438
I'd like to apologize
for being insensitive.

226
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,635
And for possibly making penguins
seem likejerks,

227
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,832
because 99 percent of them
are stand-up guys.

228
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,150
Forget about it.

229
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,555
You know, you and l--
you and l have a lot in common.

230
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:45,590
-Is that right?
-Oh, yes. l--

231
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:48,267
I, too,
am in the throes of heartbreak.

232
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,874
Okay, fine,
I'll tell you about it.

233
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:57,148
Here is a hot beverage
to comfort you.

234
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,556
It's in a to-go cup.
Make of that what you will.

235
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,948
Come on. It's still early.
Let's do something.

236
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,277
Well, l have been toying around
with an idea for 4D chess.

237
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,517
-How about we just talk?
-All right.

238
00:14:15,719 --> 00:14:17,072
-In 4D chess--
-No.

239
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:20,671
Come on, let's talk about our lives.

240
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,598
Tell me something
about you I don't know.

241
00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:28,708
I own nine pairs of pants.

242
00:14:31,319 --> 00:14:32,911
Okay, that's a good start,

243
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,076
but I was thinking maybe something
a little more personal.

244
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,793
-| see.
-Hm.

245
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,511
I own nine pairs of underpants.

246
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,470
How about | go first?

247
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,990
But I don't want to know
how many underpants you own.

248
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,158
Although, based on the floor of your
bedroom, I'd say it's a thousand.

249
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,194
Okay, look, here's something
people do not know about me.

250
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,197
When I first moved out to LA,

251
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,708
I did a topless scene
in a low-budget horror movie

252
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,911
about a killer gorilla.

253
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,599
After I did it,
I felt so ashamed.

254
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,553
Thankfully,
that thing never came out.

255
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:09,670
I've seen that.

256
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,718
-Yeah. Serial Apeist.
-(GASPS)

257
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,908
Howard found it online
the day we met you.

258
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,475
-Oh, God.
-I mean, it was literally

259
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,193
the moment you walked out the door.

260
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,195
But I see the type of personal
revelations you're going for.

261
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,873
Okay, here's one I thought
I'd take to the grave.

262
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,195
Okay.

263
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:35,478
(CHUCKLES)

264
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,469
Awhile back,
YouTube changed its user interface

265
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,470
from a star-based rating system
to a thumbs-up rating system.

266
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,753
| tell people I'm okay with it,
but I'm really not.

267
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,270
-That's your big revelation?
-Yes.

268
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,150
Whoo! lfeel ten pounds lighter.

269
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,672
Okay, you know what?
I give up. I'm going to bed.

270
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:08,076
Here's something else
you don't know about me:

271
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,272
-you just hurt my feelings.
-What did I do?

272
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,517
I opened up and shared something
deeply upsetting to me,

273
00:16:14,719 --> 00:16:16,550
and you treated it
as if it were nothing.

274
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,828
-I didn't think it was a big deal.
-It is to me, that's the point.

275
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,069
Sheldon, you are right.
I'm really sorry.

276
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,750
-I should've known better.
-Your apology is accepted.

277
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,997
Thank you. How about a hug?

278
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,634
-How about a hearty handshake?
-Come on.

279
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,076
Nowl know how you felt getting
mauled by that sex-crazed gorilla.

280
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:02,153
-Good night.
-Mm-hm.

281
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,758
It was rather flattering
to have strangers send us drinks.

282
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,996
Yeah, that felt nice.

283
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:18,917
Maybe tomorrow morning
we put on some hot pants

284
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,633
and see if we can score us
some free omelets.

285
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,989
So, hypothetically, if we
were to have gone with them,

286
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:29,268
which one would you have picked?

287
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,909
I think I would have gone with the
short one with the goofy haircut.

288
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,395
Oh, good, 'cause I liked
the tall thin one.

289
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,511
He seemed intelligent,
kind of a loner,

290
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,790
maybe a little sexually
inexperienced,

291
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,389
like I'd have
to teach him a thing or two.

292
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,027
(G ROWLS SOFTLY)

293
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,030
Not my guy.
I caught him staring at my rack.

294
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,070
It'd be nice to be with a man

295
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,918
who wants to know
what's underneath my cardigan.

296
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,394
FYl, it's another cardigan.

297
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,678
Your short, sexed-up guy
kind of sounds like Howard.

298
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,792
Your brainy virgin
kind of sounds like Sheldon.

299
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,632
-Good night.
-Night.

300
00:18:12,719 --> 00:18:15,313
All right, Dr. Koothrappali,
it's been nice talking to you,

301
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,192
but I need to go home
and relieve my babysitter.

302
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,234
I can relate to being
a single parent. l have a dog.

303
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,228
Yeah, it's exactly the same thing.
Good night.

304
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:26,713
Mrs. Davis...

305
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,595
l, uh... I must confess,
I came here tonight

306
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,472
in a futile attempt
to pick up some lonely post-doc,

307
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,389
but instead I got to connect
with you at a human level.

308
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,034
That's a much better evening.

309
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,877
You're a lovely person.

310
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,755
-Are you hitting on me?
-No, no, no, that would be crazy!

311
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,392
I mean, if I were hitting on you,
you'd know it

312
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,194
'cause you'd feel uncomfortable
and a little sad for me.

313
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:56,158
You're sweet.

314
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,035
-Good night, Dr. Koothrappali.
-Good night.

315
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,638
Looks like she accepted your apology.

316
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,355
And then some.
I think we had a moment.

317
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,869
Please, you did not
have a moment.

318
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,832
Who died and made you
king of moments?

319
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,715
Okay, fine.
Let's say there was a moment.

320
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,514
-There was.
-There wasn't. But...

321
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,473
But even if there was,
what are you gonna do about it?

322
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:29,118
I will slowly seduce her
until she falls helpless into my bed,

323
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,038
hungry for the pleasure
only I can give her.

324
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,753
-So nothing.
-No, not a thing.
