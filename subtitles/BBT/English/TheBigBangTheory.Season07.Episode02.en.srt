1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,954
And here's another
interesting weather fact.

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,515
Another? Great!

3
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:11,631
Changes in jet streams
can affect the speed

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,956
at which the Earth
rotates on its axis,

5
00:00:14,159 --> 00:00:17,310
so bad weather can actually
make the day longer.

6
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:20,795
Well, there must be a hell
of a storm somewhere.

7
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,668
Joke if you must, but you're
going to miss these moments.

8
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:27,471
With Leonard home in a few days,

9
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:30,352
this was your last time
driving me to the grocery store.

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,551
You know, lwill miss this.

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,148
I'll tell you what,
if my apples are mealy,

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,638
we'll hit the produce section
for one last crazy blowout.

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,637
Heck, you can even push the cart.

14
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:46,109
Please don't take my looking
forward to Leonard's return

15
00:00:46,319 --> 00:00:49,629
as criticism of the job you've
been doing in his absence.

16
00:00:49,839 --> 00:00:51,113
I won't.

17
00:00:51,319 --> 00:00:54,914
That criticism will come later
in your report card.

18
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,917
Yeah, I didn't stay
for the detention,

19
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,872
I'm not gonna read
the report card.

20
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,592
-Hello.
-(SCREAMS) Leonard! Hi!

21
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,279
-Sh! Keep your voice down.
-Oh, my God. You weren't supposed

22
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:09,310
-to be here till Sunday!
-We finished the experiment early,

23
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:10,918
so I thought I'd come home
and surprise you.

24
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,235
Oh, my gosh,
why are we whispering?

25
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,874
I didn't tell Sheldon
so we could have a few days alone.

26
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,232
-Oh! That is so romantic.
-Sure, that's why I did it.

27
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:22,550
ljust cannot believe you're here.

28
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:24,397
SHELDON: Penny, it's your lucky day!

29
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:27,750
Three of the eggs are clearly
not jumbo. Grab your keys.

30
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,430
J“ (THEME SONG PLAYING) J“

31
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,910
Stuart, l was wondering
if you could help me find something.

32
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,680
Happy to, unless it's hope
or a reason to live.

33
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,713
Oh, you make me laugh, sad clown.

34
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:09,631
Anyhoo, Leonard will be back
in a couple days

35
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,876
and I need awelcome-home
gift for him.

36
00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:14,309
As he's been at sea,
perhaps something

37
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,750
with a nautical theme
might be appropriate.

38
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,520
Okay, well, I don't know
how much you want to spend,

39
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,598
but I do have this pretty
cool Aquaman statue.

40
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:30,518
Aquaman?
This isn't a gag gift, Stuart.

41
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,433
Yeah, just as well.
It's a pretty rare piece.

42
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:36,550
l'd ratherjust sell it
to a real collector.

43
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,718
I'm a real collector.

44
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:41,955
How rare is it?

45
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,594
I shouldn't even have mentioned it.
How about a Batman squirt gun?

46
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,829
Ye--

47
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,516
Don't try and trick me
into buying something I don't want.

48
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:51,516
Now, let's talk Aquaman.

49
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,599
What were they thinking,
putting Doctor Octopus's mind

50
00:02:55,799 --> 00:02:57,357
in Spider-Man's body?

51
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,278
Well, I've been quite enjoying that.

52
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,630
It combines all the
superhero fun of Spider-Man

53
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,479
with all the body-switching
shenanigans of Freaky Friday.

54
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,159
Both versions: original and Lohan.

55
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,511
(INDIAN ACCENT) "Both versions:
original and Lohan." You're an idiot.

56
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,551
Hey, what's your problem?

57
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,796
I'm sorry.
I've been kind of snippy lately.

58
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:18,069
It's probably this stupid diet
I'm on.

59
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,477
-Why are you on a diet?
-l've put on a couple pounds.

60
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,158
Had to buy these pants
in the men's section.

61
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,599
Well, we've all seen your mom.

62
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,232
That Butterball turkey
was bound to come home to roost.

63
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,116
Twelve-hundred dollars!
That's my final offer!

64
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,238
All right, Sheldon, you win.

65
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,351
I'm sure Leonard
is gonna love this.

66
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,955
Oh, right, a present for Leonard.

67
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,390
You better throw in that squirt gun.

68
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,798
Hm... Yeah, I don't know.
This squirt gun, it's... it's pretty rare.

69
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:55,238
Oh!

70
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,875
And this is me doing
the Titanic pose on the boat.

71
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:02,631
Oh!

72
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,552
And... oh, that's me getting rescued
after I fell in.

73
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,835
Oh.

74
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,109
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

75
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,958
-Oh. That's the pizza.
-Yep.

76
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,956
-Here's some money.
-Thank you.

77
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,639
And I'm gonna hit the head.

78
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,559
That's what us salty sea dogs say
when we have to go pee-pee.

79
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,468
-H ey.
-Twenty-two, fifty.

80
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,398
Okay, here's 25.
Keep the change.

81
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,115
Seriously? ljust walked up,
like, four flights of stairs.

82
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,995
Oh, okay. Well, here's, um...

83
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,679
Thirty-something cents,

84
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:33,995
and a promise
I won't call your boss

85
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,760
and tell him
you reek of marijuana.

86
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,629
Oh, Penny, | see
you've ordered pizza.

87
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,035
-l have Chinese food.
-That's nice.

88
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,073
Oh, that's a rather earthy cologne.

89
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,069
My uncle used to wear that.

90
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,071
Perhaps we can enjoy one last meal
together before Leonard returns.

91
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,191
Yeah, thanks, but I kind of feel
like eating alone tonight, so--

92
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,915
Are you sure? With your ltalian pizza
and my Chinese noodles,

93
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,473
we could play Marco Polo.

94
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,240
I mean, of course,
a reenactment of a meal

95
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,715
in the life of Marco Polo
the Venetian explorer,

96
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,991
not Marco Polo
the terrifying water sport.

97
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,230
Uh, yeah. It sounds fun,
but no thanks.

98
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,236
(TOILET FLUSHES)
Have a good night!

99
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,591
-What, now, do you have company?
-No. No, no, no.

100
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,199
You know what?
The toilet's been doing that.

101
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,675
-I called the building manager, so--
-Oh, I can take a look at it.

102
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:25,313
-We||--
-l'm quite familiar with plumbing.

103
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,354
Not to brag, but I spent most of
fifth grade with my head in a toilet.

104
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,120
Yeah, no, no, no.
You know what, Sheldon, it's okay.

105
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:33,877
You don't have to go
into the bathroom.

106
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,674
That's curious.
If there's no one here,

107
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:39,791
why are there two glasses
of wine on the table?

108
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,912
Oh. Well, you know,
I've got two hands

109
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,190
and a bit of a drinking problem.

110
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,834
Of course.
Ask a silly question.

111
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:51,951
-That's odd.
-What?

112
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,310
There are takeout containers
in the trash can.

113
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,795
So? That's my dinner from last night.

114
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,753
What's odd is they're
in the trash can.

115
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,269
Okay. Look, honey,
I promise there's no one's here.

116
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,788
I've had a long day. ljust want
to have a quiet dinner by myself.

117
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,116
Oh, very well.

118
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:11,358
I'm no stranger to enjoying
the pleasures of solitude.

119
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,676
-Oh!
-What?

120
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:15,551
Have you gotten Leonard
a welcome-home gift yet?

121
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,670
-No.
-Oh, great.

122
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,599
Do you want to go halfsies
on a 200 dollar squirt gun?

123
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,678
-Hi, honey.
-Hey.

124
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,279
I made some brownies.
You want one?

125
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,833
You're kidding, right?

126
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,833
I mean, you know
I'm trying to lose weight.

127
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,191
God, I thought we were partners
in this marriage.

128
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,597
We are. Stop it. And for the
last time, you're not fat.

129
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,518
Really? Tell that
to the bathroom scale,

130
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,790
'cause one of you is lying.

131
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:48,075
Fine, forget I asked.
How was dinner at your mom's?

132
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:51,476
Awful. I had to rub her ointment
all over her again.

133
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,954
Why can't she do it?

134
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,118
'Cause we've got a deeply
unhealthy relationship.

135
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,679
Which reminds me,

136
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,030
do you think you can get
any samples of this from work?

137
00:07:01,239 --> 00:07:02,308
This was supposed
to last her a month,

138
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:05,397
but they didn't take into account
the square footage of her back.

139
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,792
Let me see.

140
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,239
How long have you been
putting this on her?

141
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,351
I don't know.
Few weeks. Why?

142
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,120
This is really strong estrogen cream.

143
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,753
Please tell me
you've been wearing gloves.

144
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,032
Like these swollen sausages
could fit in gloves.

145
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,708
Howie, the estrogen's
getting absorbed by your skin.

146
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:26,830
That's why you've been
all bloated and moody

147
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,235
and a giant pain in the ass.

148
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,398
You're full of estrogen
and you don't act like that.

149
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:37,037
That's 'cause I'm a woman. I've had
years of practice riding the dragon.

150
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:41,114
Fine. I'll wear gloves next time.

151
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,039
It's still gonna take a few weeks for
the hormones to leave your system.

152
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,233
| feel so stupid. And fat.

153
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:52,197
It's okay.
You still look great to me.

154
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,359
In fact, why don't we go in the
bedroom and I'll prove it to you?

155
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,916
Sex? Really? I mean,
that's just your solution to everything!

156
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,197
Oh, and here's a fun thing.

157
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:06,959
I worked it out so that there are
two different words for spoon:

158
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,628
"planko" and "janko."

159
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,468
"Planko" is a spoon with food,
"janko" is a spoon without food.

160
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,118
"Janko" is spelled
with a silent "ptang."

161
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,509
Sheldon, you're not even listening
to the rules of my made-up language.

162
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,757
-Yes, I am.
-Then what does "tweepadock" mean?

163
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:28,074
Uh...

164
00:08:28,719 --> 00:08:29,674
Elephant?

165
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,715
Lucky guess.

166
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,470
I'm sorry.

167
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,513
I'm just distracted by something
that happened over at Penny's.

168
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,630
What happened?

169
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,354
I fear Penny is being unfaithful
to Leonard.

170
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,199
-What?
-She claimed to be alone

171
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,358
when there was obviously
someone else in her apartment.

172
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,755
l have no choice but
to assume the worst,

173
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,837
given Leonard's lengthy sea voyage

174
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,032
and her famously
ravenous nether regions.

175
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,952
I don't think Penny
would cheat on Leonard.

176
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,071
Oh, really?
(LAUGHS)

177
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:05,598
She and I once had
a staring contest.

178
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,268
She clapped really loud
and made me blink.

179
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,509
It's a small leap from there
to sexual infidelity.

180
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:16,550
You're being ridiculous.

181
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:21,436
Amy, there were Chinese
food containers... in the trash can.

182
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,439
Poor Leonard.

183
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:33,628
-Do you hear anything?
-I hear a woman's voice.

184
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,228
-Is it Penny?
-No, it's you.

185
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,994
All right,
I hear whispering and giggling.

186
00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:42,598
Now I think I hear kissing.

187
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,394
Yeah, like you know
what kissing sounds like.

188
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,956
There's kissing in Star Trek,
smarty-pants.

189
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,593
Let me listen.

190
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,435
-Sounds like Leonard.
-Please.

191
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,269
Why would Leonard come home early
and waste his time kissing Penny

192
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,948
when he could be hanging out
with his best buddy?

193
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,353
Yeah, that's it.
I'm catching her in the act.

194
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,551
No, Sheldon, don't.

195
00:10:09,199 --> 00:10:09,631
A-ha!

196
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:12,268
-What the hell?!
-Leonard?

197
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,152
Sheldon, you cannot just
barge in here like that!

198
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,588
Right.

199
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,076
(KNOCKING LOUDLY)

200
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,918
SHELDON: Penny! Penny! Penny!

201
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,392
Are you going to answer the door
or should I open it

202
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,953
and say "a-ha" again?

203
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,114
I'm sorry, Sheldon.
lshould've told you l was back.

204
00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:38,116
| just wanted to have
a couple days alone with Penny.

205
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,311
Oh, no, I should apologize.

206
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:43,989
I never realized to what extent
our friendship was a burden to you.

207
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:45,632
That is not fair.

208
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,797
| complain about what a burden it is
at least once a month.

209
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:50,512
Oh, no, no, let's not sugarcoat this.

210
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,030
You find me finicky,
pedantic and annoying.

211
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,309
No, he doesn't.

212
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,750
I actually have used
those exact words before.

213
00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:00,988
In that order.

214
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,198
Well, Leonard,
I think it's high time

215
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,357
you and I address
the "tweepadock" in the room.

216
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:09,908
-The what?
-Amy?

217
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,588
-Please leave me out of this.
-Fine.

218
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,395
Leonard, there's no need for you
to pretend to like me anymore.

219
00:11:16,599 --> 00:11:19,511
-Come on, I said I was sorry.
-No, no, you save your apologies

220
00:11:19,719 --> 00:11:22,711
for after you've had
disappointing coitus with Penny.

221
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,236
It was fine.

222
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,839
Come on, this is silly.

223
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,113
Hey, I brought you back
a little present from my trip, huh?

224
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,838
It's that sailor cap that you wanted.
lt's neat, huh?

225
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,916
You honestly think you can buy back
my friendship with a cheap souvenir?

226
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,037
I don't. No, I really don't.
Just try it on.

227
00:11:51,719 --> 00:11:52,629
-Oh, yeah.
-Hello, sailor.

228
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,558
Now we're talking.

229
00:11:56,839 --> 00:11:57,749
Excuse me.

230
00:12:06,199 --> 00:12:07,917
This changes nothing.

231
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,236
Except the Halloween costume
I'm wearing this year.

232
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,551
Amy, you're going to be Olive Oyl.
Lay off the donuts.

233
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:22,115
-Thanks for coming over.
-No problem.

234
00:12:22,319 --> 00:12:23,513
Ooh! You made little sandwiches!

235
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,154
Yeah, that's cucumber
and cream cheese.

236
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,793
That's turkey and loganberry.

237
00:12:27,999 --> 00:12:31,514
And don't tell my hips, but I'm
warming up a brie in the oven.

238
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:33,437
Nice. So...

239
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,230
What's up?

240
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,432
Okay, well, I've been reading up
on all the side effects

241
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:43,191
you can get from estrogen, and...
I need you to be honest with me.

242
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,510
Do my boobs look bigger to you?

243
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,031
Well, it's kind of hard to tell.

244
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,958
Come on, Raj,
it's a "yes or no" question.

245
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:54,719
I'm not sure. Um... Wait.

246
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,593
Jump up and down,
let's see if theyjiggle.

247
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,558
No, l... I still can't tell. Uh...

248
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:10,791
Oh, you know what?
Okay, give me some of this.

249
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,237
-Seriously?
-Do you want my help or not?

250
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,279
Fine.

251
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,837
Okay, yup.

252
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:28,190
See, see, that looks like...
that looks like they could be bigger.

253
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,036
But, you know, I bet--l bet when
I do it, mine do the same thing.

254
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,592
-Yeah, they kind of do.
-Hm... Let me see something.

255
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,438
Hey, easy!

256
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,150
-My nipples are sensitive.
-Oh. Sorry, sorry.

257
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,310
(EXHALES)

258
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,158
Okay.

259
00:13:55,319 --> 00:13:57,037
I mean...

260
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,437
Yeah, maybe.

261
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,756
Okay, let me feel.

262
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,632
No, lam definitely up a cup size.

263
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,479
You know, but they're very firm,
so you've got that going for you.

264
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,513
-You think?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, very perky.

265
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,598
Thank you.
I really needed to hear that today.

266
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,116
(OVEN DINGS)

267
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,394
-Ooh! Brie's ready!
-Yay!

268
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,791
-Good morning.
-Hello.

269
00:14:37,319 --> 00:14:39,958
So am | driving you to work,
or are you still mad at me?

270
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:41,478
I'd like a ride.

271
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,074
Assuming you actually do
take me to work.

272
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,792
Where do you think I would take you?

273
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:50,992
Who knows? You said
you'd be home yesterday,

274
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,791
but you came home three days ago.

275
00:14:52,999 --> 00:14:56,036
You say you're taking me
to work, but for all I know,

276
00:14:56,239 --> 00:14:59,834
I'll end up
in a deserted amusement park.

277
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,554
Or a cornfield maze.

278
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:05,592
Or a back-alley dog fight.
You tell me.

279
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,872
I'm going to work.
You can come if you want.

280
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:10,637
Okay.

281
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,239
By the way, you have
something on your shirt.

282
00:15:14,439 --> 00:15:17,397
-No, I don't.
-Hurts, doesn't it?

283
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,879
You know, lfind myself wondering

284
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,833
if anything you've
ever told me is true.

285
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,157
I didn't make it back.
The ship sank, I'm in hell.

286
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,792
You say you're from New Jersey,
but how can I believe you?

287
00:15:36,999 --> 00:15:40,196
Why would anyone claim to be
from New Jersey if they weren't?

288
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:44,196
All right, I'll give you that one.

289
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,439
Hey, I said lwas sorry.
What else do you want from me?

290
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,755
I want you to admit that
what you did was wrong.

291
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,792
Fine. What I did was wrong.

292
00:15:53,999 --> 00:15:55,796
lwish I could believe you.

293
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,076
You know what?
I'm not driving you to work,

294
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,713
because you're incredibly annoying.

295
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,990
You say one thing and do the other,

296
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:07,078
so then you are driving me
and you find me a delight.

297
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,951
-Stop it.
-Keep it up?

298
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:11,195
-Bye!
-Hello!

299
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,877
So I guess you're really
holding up the other four fingers?

300
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:23,871
Oh, hey, what are you
doing here so early?

301
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,547
-Driving Sheldon to work.
-He's still mad at Leonard, huh?

302
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:28,033
He's mad at you, too.

303
00:16:28,239 --> 00:16:31,515
He says you're the succubus
who led his friend astray.

304
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:36,237
I don't know
what "succubus" is, but...

305
00:16:36,439 --> 00:16:38,509
it has "suck" in it,
so that can't be good.

306
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,676
-Thought I heard you out here.
-Hey, Sheldon.

307
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:45,871
You don't get a "hey."
You get a "hmm."

308
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,717
Come on, don't be like that.

309
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,036
We had so much fun together
the last couple of months.

310
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,993
You're right. Which makes your
betrayal all the more devastating.

311
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,757
-Sheldon...
-I let you buy

312
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,792
feminine hygiene products
with my supermarket club card.

313
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:02,550
You have any idea the kind of coupons
I'm going to get in the mail now?

314
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,593
Sheldon, your fight's with Leonard.
Penny's got nothing to do--

315
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,152
Careful, Amy.

316
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,875
The friend of my enemy's girlfriend
is my enemy.

317
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,479
-Really?
-Yes.

318
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,397
You're either with me or against me.

319
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,556
You want to take the bus to work?

320
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,549
Maybe there's a third option.

321
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:26,595
FYI, I had a doughnut
for breakfast, you jerk.

322
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,877
So now we're just waiting
for the data

323
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:34,435
from the ship to be crunched, but the
numbers look pretty promising.

324
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,269
That's so great. If you guys prove
the existence of Unruh radiation--

325
00:17:38,479 --> 00:17:40,231
Hey, hey, hey!
My eyes are up here.

326
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,472
Howard, Raj, Judas.

327
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,160
You know what?
You're a crazy person.

328
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,237
A crazy person with a long memory,

329
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,238
and if all goes according to plan,
a robot army.

330
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,191
-Stop it.
-Or a mutant army.

331
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,709
It depends on how
my Kickstarter goes.

332
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,316
I said stop it!

333
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,511
Now, listen to me.

334
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:08,597
You two aren't just friends.

335
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,471
You're best friends.

336
00:18:11,439 --> 00:18:13,669
And that's a beautiful thing.

337
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:18,988
I mean, Leonard, you know
why he's so mad at you?

338
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:21,349
lt's 'cause he missed you!

339
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:24,312
Yeah, and as his friend,
you should be happy

340
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,990
he has love in his life.

341
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,997
As I do.

342
00:18:31,999 --> 00:18:35,230
This man held my breast
the other day, and I love him for it.

343
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,156
A little loud, dude.

344
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,274
So can we please put aside
these petty differences

345
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,597
and just be glad
we're here together?

346
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,228
-Okay.
-I suppose so.

347
00:18:52,439 --> 00:18:54,111
Thank you.

348
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:58,633
It wasn't anything weird.
It was just to see how big they were.

349
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:07,397
And then Leonard took me
to the barber and the dentist,

350
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,238
and then to cap off the perfect day,

351
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:12,317
the Los Angeles Bureau
of Weights and Measures.

352
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,034
I thought the measures were
going to be the stars of the show.

353
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:18,707
Turns out it was the weights.

354
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:21,592
I'm so glad you guys
are friends again.

355
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:24,757
And I'm glad you and l
are friends again, too.

356
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:28,156
Which reminds me. This came in the
mail, and I want you to have it.

357
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,511
"Fifty cents off Vagisil."

358
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,509
Think of me when you apply it.

359
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,437
Can ljust say, I've missed
all of us hanging out together.

360
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,039
-Yeah.
-Me, too.

361
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,233
Um, since when can Koothrappali talk
in front of the girls without a beer?

362
00:19:47,439 --> 00:19:49,270
Oh, that happened
right after you left.

363
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,754
And no one told me?

364
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,191
Can't believe we forgot to tell him.

365
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,592
Ahem. Think of Sheldon
when you apply it.

366
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,077
