1
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:08,151
Sn... couldn't help
but notice none of you RSVP'd

2
00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:10,429
to my murder mystery dinner party.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,029
Oh, yeah.
We were meaning to do that.

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,277
No, you weren't, because it
was a week ago and nobody came!

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,835
So if you want to solve the mystery
of who stabbed Koothrappali

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,157
in the back with the weapon of
indifference, it was all of you.

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,753
I don't think that qualifies
as a mystery.

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,393
We all knew what we were doing.

9
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,272
-We're sorry, Rajesh.
-Maybe we can do it next week.

10
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,232
(LAUGHS)
Whoa, we're not that sorry.

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,149
Don't worry, I can take a hint.
No more murder mystery parties.

12
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,554
-Thank you.
-Ha||e|ujah.

13
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,398
Because I've got something
even better planned!

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,273
-Come on!
-Just hear me out.

15
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:46,709
I'm going to make you guys
a scavenger hunt

16
00:00:46,919 --> 00:00:48,113
like they have at MIT.

17
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,833
Oh, I loved those.
I did them every year there.

18
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,951
-We did them at Princeton, too.
-Oh, that's cute.

19
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,354
Like it's a real college.

20
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,155
That's amusing. I was going
to say that about MIT,

21
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,951
but it works for Princeton, too.

22
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,276
Scavenger hunts at Harvard
were really tough.

23
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,197
I always got stuck
on the first challenge.

24
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,196
Trying to find someone
to be on a team with me.

25
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,309
(LAUGHS)

26
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,834
I guess that story's
more sad than funny.

27
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,435
I love scavenger hunts. My friends
and I had them all the time.

28
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,595
Oh, these are a little different.

29
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,791
There's a tradition
at elite universities.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,274
And Princeton.

31
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,036
Atradition of hunts full of puzzles
that rely on logic,

32
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:28,831
obscure knowledge, science.

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,395
Oh, in ours we would just run
around town looking for a store

34
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:33,396
that would sell us beer.

35
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,155
-So, who's in?
-I think it sounds fun.

36
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,270
-Yeah, me, too.
-I'm in.

37
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,356
-Let's do it.
-I'm sorry.

38
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,028
Are we really doing this
or are we tricking Koothrappali again

39
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,753
like with the dinner party?

Oh, everything I could possibly need
to win the scavenger hunt.

43
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,318
You really think he's gonna
send us to a bowling alley?

44
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,478
Well, if he does, do you know how
filthy those rental balls are?

45
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,109
They might as well
stand on the corner

46
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,038
and give away free rectal exams.

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,872

Ahem.

Okay, everybody.

Any questions? (ECHOING)

64
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,269
Yes, to be fair, do people who went
to Princeton get a head start?

65
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,754
That's not funny.

66
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,713
Oh, it actually is,
if you get the joke.

67
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,515
It's based on the premise that
Princeton isn't a very good school.

68
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,590
Ha-ha.

69
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,910
Oh, see? Now, he gets it.

70
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,992
Okay, guys, go ahead and divide
yourselves into teams of two.

71
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,760
-Should we just do couples?
-Couples sounds great.

72
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:05,872
Or we could mix things up.
Maybe pick names out of a hat, whatever.

73
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,991
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

74
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,839
Why don't you just admit you don't
want to be on a team with me.

75
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,792
Ijust said, "Couples sound great."

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,672
Mm-hmm, yeah, you don't
think I'm smart enough.

77
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,472
You think I'm gonna be a liability.

78
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,148
Even though I totallyjust used
the word "liability" correctly

79
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:21,838
in a sentence.

80
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:25,077
Yeah.

81
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:27,429
No, let's do couples. I want to.

82
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,870
No, no, no. Let's mix things up.

83
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,877
I choose Sheldon,
and we're gonna kick your ass!

84
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,150
Yeah-- really?

85
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:35,872
The only time I'm ever
picked first for a team

86
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,991
and I'm stuck with the liability?

87
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,677
Stop that.
Penny is not a liability.

88
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,518
Thank you.
Do you want to be on my team?

89
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,711
Maybe we pick names out of a hat.

90
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,312
Hurry up and close the door
so they can't hear us.

91
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,268
Would you stop pouting?
So, you picked my name. Get over it.

92
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,473
Yes, and do you know what
the odds are I'd pick your name?

93
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,592
-No.
-It's not hard: one in five.

94
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,472
Now you know why I'm pouting.

95
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,472
RAJ (OVER RADIO): All right, teams.
Get ready to open your ﬁrst puzzle.

96
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,079
Go!

97
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,996
Do you see what I did?
The ﬁrst puzzle is a puzzle!

98
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,589
Oh, my God, how adorable is that?

99
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,916
I wish I had a friend like me.

100
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,514
What are you doing?
You have to start with the edges.

101
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:33,273
There's no right way, Sheldon.
I already found a few pieces that fit.

102
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,512
Yeah, well, take them apart
and start with the edges.

103
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,593
And stop wasting time.

104
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:43,629
Wow, you're really good at puzzles.

105
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,909
I did them all the time as a kid.

106
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,395
As my mom used to say,
"When you're doing a puzzle,

107
00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:49,954
it's like having a thousand friends."

108
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,350
She was full
of fun lies like that.

109
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,155
If it makes you feel any better,
my mom's just full of pound cake.

110
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,794
I'm sorry you got stuck with me.

111
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,228
I bet you wanted
to be with Bernadette.

112
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:04,798
Have you ever played
a game with Bernadette?

113
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,433
-No.
-Have you ever gone

114
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,949
into a steel cage with a wolverine?

115
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,395
(YELLING) Faster, faster, faster!
Do you not know that word?

116
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:16,114
-It means "more fast"!
-Stop yelling at me.

117
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,869
Hey! You'll know
when I'm yelling at you.

118
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,596
Oh. Oh, it's the comic book store!
All right, come on.

119
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,994
That's where we have to go.

120
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,519
But we haven't finished the puzzle.

121
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,871
Well, it doesn't matter!
We know the answer!

122
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,595
You think you know the answer.
But it could be a trick.

123
00:06:32,799 --> 00:06:34,471
What if when the puzzle's complete,

124
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,318
there's a sign
in the window that says,

125
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:37,918
"Go to the train store"?

126
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,838
Okay, it's not gonna say that.

127
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,953
Well, I hope you're wrong.
I really want to go to the train store.

128
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:48,147
It's the comic book store. Let's go!

129
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,272
Come on, numb nuts,
it's the comic book store!

130
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,231
It's the comic book store,
it's the comic book store,

131
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,839
it's the comic book store!

132
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,749
(GROANS)

133
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,797
-It's the comic book store.
-Oh!

134
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:21,308
-Do you think Penny's mad at me?
-Because you're in the right lane

135
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:25,398
behind a bus and won't go around it?
I'm sure she finds it charming.

136
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,194
No, because I didn't
want her on my team.

137
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,550
I'm starting to think
she dodged a bullet.

138
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,591
The slowest bullet in the world.

139
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,469
I never realized
you were so competitive.

140
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,591
Yeah, I know.

141
00:07:38,799 --> 00:07:41,359
It's probably because I grew up
with five brothers and sisters

142
00:07:41,559 --> 00:07:42,469
so I had to fight for every--

143
00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:44,909
Oh, my God, you did not
just slow down for a bird!

144
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,792
You know they fly, right?!

145
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:53,514
I think this is
the first time we've ever

146
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,312
actually been alone together.

147
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:58,955
Huh, I guess you're right.
Wonder why that is.

148
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,833
Well, off the top of my head,
I'd say we don't have a lot

149
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:04,349
in common except for the people
we're involved with.

150
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,437
Plus, when we first met,
Penny warned me never

151
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,834
to get into a car alone with you.

152
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,679
Yeah.

153
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,670
You know, I bet you and I have
more in common than we think.

154
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,394
-Such as?
-I don't know.

155
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,398
-Tell me some things you like.
-Uh, let's see.

156
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,592
I like harps,
Little House on the Prairie,

157
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:27,676
medieval poetry,
medieval literature--

158
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,552
Hey, how about some music?

159
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:33,593
Great. Sheldon never lets me
listen to music in the car.

160
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,155
He doesn't want to be mistaken
for a gang member.

161
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,920
Find something you like.

162
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,315

Eminem, scary.

164
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:46,109
Weird Al? How old are you?

165
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,279
-Neil Diamond?
-Yeah, I love Neil Diamond.

166
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,993
I love Neil Diamond.

-Oh, my pleasure.

00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,872
Always happy to help out
with fun things

171
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,354
that I wasn't invited
to be a part of.

172
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,235
Oh, congratulations.
You're the first team to arrive.

173
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,829
Yes! It's not a ruse
to make fun of me!

174
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,473
It's a real game and I'm winning it!

175
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,157
Your next puzzle is a riddle.

176
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,114
And who better to give it to you
than The Riddler?

177
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,274
5°. 9°. 9°. 9°. 9°. 9°. 9°. 9°.
9°. 9°. 9°. 9°. 9°. 9°. 9°!

178
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,993
How am I faster than you?

179
00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:48,111
I'm in heels and I stopped
to take a phone call.

180
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,393
I have asthma. Back off!

181
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,639
"Riddle me this.
Arrah, Arrah, and gather round,

182
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,400
the work of this hero
is legion-bound.

183
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,955
He multiplies N
by the number of He,

184
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,311
and in this room
the thing you'll see."

185
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,669
-Good riddle, huh?
-Yeah.

186
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,429
So when you guys plan fun activities,
does my name even...

187
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:12,152
come up, or...?

188
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,477
I invited you to my
murder mystery party.

189
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,879
-No, you didn't.
-Oh.

190
00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:24,275
(GROANS) We're the last ones here,
hurry up!

191
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,517
-It is a marathon, not a sprint.
-People run in a marathon!

192
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,438
Not with a bowling ball
on their back.

193
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,835
Hey, Penny, Ijust
wanted to say good luck,

194
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,314
and I hope there's no hard feelings.

195
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,750
Hey, Romeo! Repair your relationship
on your own time!

196
00:10:38,319 --> 00:10:41,231
Relax, it's a hard puzzle.
It's gonna take a while to solve.

197
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,919
-"Ridd|e me this--"
-Got it.

198
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,709
Hey, Princeton, look at that,

199
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,876
Team Community College Night School
is in the lead.

200
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,268
I thought we were
the Lightning Sharks!

201
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,711
Hey, you know what this could mean...

202
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,038
Oh, oh, that's good.
Then this would be...

203
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,470
-That's it.
-To the Neil Mobile!

204
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,157
I knew it, we're gonna lose!

205
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,759
Wait, I got it. I got it!

206
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,349
Congratulations, you got it last.

207
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,595
You're really mean, you know that?

208
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,596
So no one's gonna buy anything.

209
00:11:30,479 --> 00:11:33,232
A-ha! Okay...

210
00:11:33,439 --> 00:11:34,792
Let's see.

211
00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:38,355
"To continue on your quest,
leave no stone unturned."

212
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,710
The next clue must be hidden
under one of these rocks.

213
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,717
Okay.

214
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,035
Sheldon, I've got to ask.

215
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,595
How did you figure out
that it was the geology lab?

216
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,516
Oh, simple.

217
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,473
The Arrah Arrah in the riddle
meant Jan Arrah,

218
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,114
a member of the Legion of
Superheroes known as Element Lad.

219
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,312
And then the word "He,"
it wasn't the masculine pronoun,

220
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:59,033
but rather, "H-E,"
the abbreviation for helium.

221
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,917
See where I'm going with this?

222
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,633
-Yes.
-Nice try.

223
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,876
Now, Element Lad's ability

224
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,957
is the power to transmute
chemical elements.

225
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,435
Helium has an atomic number of two.

226
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,269
If you multiply that by the
atomic number of "N," nitrogen,

227
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:20,552
you get 14, which is
the atomic number of...?

228
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:25,956
I'm just funnin' you, silicon.
And that is the most common element

229
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,116
in the Earth's surface.
So that narrowed it down

230
00:12:28,319 --> 00:12:30,116
to the geology lab
or the chemistry lab.

231
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,390
Wow.

232
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:34,715
I can drink a beer underwater.

233
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:37,637
And I'm sure your parents are proud.

234
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,958
Now, finally, the line
"in this room the thing you'll see"

235
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:45,071
was an obvious reference
to Fantastic Four member The Thing,

236
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,828
-who's made entirely of--
-Shut up. I solved it!

237
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,794
(GASPS)

238
00:12:52,999 --> 00:12:55,035
Those are map coordinates.

239
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,151
Got 'em. Let's go.

240
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,079
Wait. Don't you want to know
how I figured it out?

241
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,793
No one likes a know-it-all, Penny.

242
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,119
J“ (SINGING NEIL DIAMOND'S
"AMERICA") J“

243
00:13:24,439 --> 00:13:25,667
Um...

244
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:30,595
I'm okay with you driving my car,
I'm not okay with you flying my car.

245
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,711
Don't sweat it, my dad's a cop.
He can fix things.

246
00:13:34,359 --> 00:13:36,509
Uh-huh. Like death?

247
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,793
Your kid may be an honor student,
but you're a moron!

248
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,712
Penny's not answering my texts.

249
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,512
Who cares?
Focus on the game.

250
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,995
This stupid game is why
she's mad in the first place.

251
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,757
-I'm telling her I'm quitting.
-No!

252
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,234
Quitting would be the worst thing
for your relationship.

253
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,350
Why?

254
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,518
Because it would make you seem like
something she already thinks you are.

255
00:13:57,719 --> 00:14:01,792
-What does she think I am?
-How do I put this?

256
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,869
She's been known to call you a name
that usually applies to a lady part.

257
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,910
Or a cat.

258
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:13,915
Or a willow.

259
00:14:17,319 --> 00:14:19,037
I can't believe
she would say that about me.

260
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,391
If you're gonna cry about it,
there's tissues in my purse.

261
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,672
Unless you got some in yours.
Big willow.

262

J“ (SINGING NEIL DIAMOND'S

263
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,990
Okay... another 30 feet.

264
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,918
Okay.

265
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,678
Oh. It's a bowling alley.

266
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,071
Yes. Yes!

267
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:04,990
(YELLING)
My brain is better than everybody's!

268
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:11,635
J“ (SINGING NEIL DIAMOND'S
"LOVE ON THE ROCKS") J“

269
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,072
Call me a lady part.
We'll see about that.

270
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,390
-Can you reach the clue?
-Almost.

271
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,717
Hurry, Sheldon and Penny were right
behind us in the bowling alley.

272
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,309
-Got it!
-Great, climb back up.

273
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,837
Come on!

274
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,554
Yeah, Penny might be onto something.

275
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,552
-To the planetarium!
-Let's go!

276
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,830
-To the tar pits!
-Let's go!

277
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,678
There's a Neil Diamond
concert next month!

278
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:53,471
Let's go!

279
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,152
Three bags, no one's opened 'em.
We're the first ones here!

280
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,674
-It's dirty laundry. You're up.
-Why me?

281
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,110
Because you've been training
for this your whole life.

282
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:07,389
You live in a pile of dirty laundry.

283
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:11,187
They're here first.
This is because

284
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,594
you made me slow down
for that blind guy.

285
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,634
-Okay, the clue must be in the bag.
-The clue must be in the bag.

286
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,990
-It's just a bunch of pants.
-It's just a bunch of pants.

287
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:22,717
You know, I'm surprised
you want to copy my answers

288
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,478
since I'm not even smart
enough to be on your team.

289
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,910
Well, why would you want
to be on someone's team

290
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,237
who you like to call a-- I can't
even say it in front of Sheldon.

291
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,395
What are you talking about?

292
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,238
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

293
00:16:34,439 --> 00:16:36,634
No, she doesn't.
Ijust made that up.

294
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:38,833
Why would you do that?

295
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,429
Because you were about to quit like
a big-- Sheldon, cover your ears.

296
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,396
I'm not a child.
I know the word "ninny."

297
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,235
Yeah, well, you should have quit
'cause I'm still gonna beat your ass.

298
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,034
Wish I had a man
like her on my team.

299
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,232
Hey, I am every bit
as much of a man as Penny.

300
00:16:55,439 --> 00:16:57,350
Now, let's do this!

301
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,154
Wait, it's not all pants,
there's one shirt.

302
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,794
-Oh.
-Hey, that's my shirt.

303
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,911
-This one is, too.
-No, no, that's not mine.

304
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,350
-That has a big spot on it.
-Wait. So does this one.

305
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,197
Maybe the spot's the clue.

306
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,914
"Sheldon's spot."
The coin is in your spot!

307
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,630
-Oh, that's clever.
-PENNY: Hurry!

308
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,479
Be there in a minute.
I just have to pre-soak these!

309
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,509
(ALL YELLING)

310
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:32,796
Stop her, Leonard! Stop her!

311
00:17:36,439 --> 00:17:38,270
(ALL YELLING)

312
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,437
-Where the hell's the coin?
-Wasn't the answer Sheldon's spot?

313
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,599
Oh, yes, Leonard. Yes, it was.

314
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,592
-Then where's the coin?
-Yes, exactly.

315
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,073
Where is the coin?

316
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,630
Why don't you look in your pockets?

317
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,948
I slipped them in there
earlier today.

318
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,032
-I don't get it.
-Don't you see?

319
00:18:07,239 --> 00:18:11,118
When we're all having fun together,
we're already winners.

320
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,992
Oh, look. See?

321
00:18:13,199 --> 00:18:15,190
Even I'm awinner.

322
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,509
Are you kidding me?

323
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,354
That is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

324
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,235
You suck so hard.

325
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,239
Well, Ithought...
Come on, I didn't want anyone

326
00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:33,111
to feel bad at the end of the game.

327
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,311
And some of those puzzles
were really hard

328
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,919
and I didn't know
who was gonna get Penny.

329
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:44,671
Run.

330
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,952
Okay, okay, that came out wrong,
but you have to admit,

331
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:50,115
you all had awonderful time.

332
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,476
Run to India.

333
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:57,557
I just wanted to do
something beautiful!

334
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:03,992
