2
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:12,669
-Sn what did you think?
-It was good.

3
00:00:13,399 --> 00:00:15,594
That's it? "Good"?

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,313
I enjoyed it.

5
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:19,555
When you told me I was going to be
"losing my virginity,"

6
00:00:19,759 --> 00:00:21,750
I didn't think you meant showing me
Raiders of the Lost Ark

7
00:00:21,959 --> 00:00:22,914
for the first time.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,673
My apologies.
I chose my words poorly

9
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:28,028
I should have said

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,470
you were about to have
your world rocked on my couch.

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,993
Anyway, thank you for watching it.

12
00:00:35,199 --> 00:00:36,837
It's one of my all-time favorites.

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,951
It was very entertaining,

14
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:41,309
despite the glaring story problem.

15
00:00:42,519 --> 00:00:44,237
Story problem?

16
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:45,075
Oh.

17
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:46,428
Amy...

18
00:00:48,519 --> 00:00:51,158
What a dewy-eyed moon-calf you are.

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,828
Raiders of the Lost Ark is
the love child

20
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:55,870
of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas,

21
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,389
two of the most gifted filmmakers
of our generation.

22
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,955
I've watched it 36 times,

23
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:03,832
except for the snake scene
and the face-melting scene,

24
00:01:04,039 --> 00:01:07,236
which I can only watch
when it's still light out, but...

25
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,431
l defy you to find a story problem.

26
00:01:10,639 --> 00:01:12,869
Here's myjaw... drop it.

27
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,556
All right.

28
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,957
Indiana Jones plays no role
in the outcome of the story.

29
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:23,072
If he weren't in the film,
it would turn out exactly the same.

30
00:01:23,279 --> 00:01:26,555
Oh, I see your confusion.
You don't understand.

31
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,229
Indiana Jones was the one in the hat
with the whip.

32
00:01:31,199 --> 00:01:34,077
No, I do,
and if he weren't in the movie,

33
00:01:34,279 --> 00:01:36,031
the Nazis would have still found
the ark,

34
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,959
taken it to the island,
opened it up and all died,

35
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,151
just like they did.

36
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:47,472
Let me close that for you.

38
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,473
-Hey!
-Hi!

39
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,557
I thought you went to the comic book
store on Wednesdays.

40
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,830
Yeah, but Sheldon and Amy
were having date night

41
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,759
and they don't need me there
to make it awkward.

42
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,070
They have each other for that.

43
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,275
So, how was school?

44
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,754
Oh, good. Check it out.

45
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,588
The Disappointing Child
by Beverly Hofstadter. Oh!

46
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:45,479
-You bought my mom's book?
-Yeah!

47
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,714
It's on the recommended reading list
for my psychology class.

48
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,633
Oh!

49
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,589
Come on. Not that book.

50
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,435
It's got, like, every horrible story
from my childhood in it.

51
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,839
Oh, cool. Are there pictures?

52
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:05,473
Seriously, please find another book.

53
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,910
Oh, come on. Why?
How bad could it be?

54
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,111
There's chapters
about potty training,

55
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,880
and bed-wetting and...

56
00:03:13,079 --> 00:03:14,717
masturbation.

57
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,473
Basically, if something came
out of me, she wrote about it!

58
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,111
You know what?
Do whatever you want,

59
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,599
just don't talk to me about it.

60
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,633
Not even the chapter
on the breast-feeding crisis?

61
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,235
It was not a crisis.

62
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,389
Apparently, I favored the left one.
She got a little lopsided.

63
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,627
Oh, my God, you still go left!

64
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,789
Which celebrity would you say
I look like the most?

65
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:52,591
Halle Berry.

66
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,588
Why?

67
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:57,915
Stuart and l are putting
dating profiles online,

68
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,433
and it's one of the questions.

69
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:02,387
And thank you. I'd kill
for that woman's bone structure.

70
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,512
Why are you reading
Pride arid Prejudice?

71
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:07,708
I'll tell you why.

72
00:04:08,279 --> 00:04:10,839
Amy ruined
Raiders of the Lost Ark for me,

73
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,715
so now I'm trying to find something
beloved to her and ruin that.

74
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:18,833
Because her life wasn't enough?

75
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:25,032
Wait. How can anyone ruin
Raiders? It's perfect.

76
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,393
Yeah, except for the fact

77
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,988
that Indiana Jones is completely
irrelevant to the story.

78
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,755
With or without him, the Nazis find
the ark, open it, and die.

79
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,393
(GRUMBLING)

80
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,555
Hey, wait a minute. No, the Nazis
were digging in the wrong place.

81
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:47,068
The only reason they got the ark
was because lndy found it first.

82
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,759
Actually, they were only digging
in the wrong place

83
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,029
because lndy had the medallion.

84
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,596
Without him, they would have had
the medallion and dug in the right place.

85
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,477
(GRUMBLING)

86
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,674
Okay, I know you don't
want to talk about it,

87
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:06,598
but can ljust ask you one question
about your mom's book?

88
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,830
-No.
-| just want to know

89
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,075
why a five-year-old boy puts
on his mom's makeup

90
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,111
and wears balloon boobies.

91
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,195
They weren't boobies.
They were muscles.

92
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:22,116
And the makeup was green.
l was pretending to be the Hulk.

93
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:24,238
You were wearing her bra.

94
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:25,428
That was to keep my muscles
from sagging!

95
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,756
Can we please stop talking
about this?!

96
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:31,398
Okay, okay. But you know,
as a student of psychology

97
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:34,472
who got a check-plus on her
first homework assignment...

98
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,438
lthink, sometimes, it's good
to open up about these things.

99
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,631
Okay, fine. Do you want to know
why I dressed like the Hulk?

100
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,357
Because I was always mad at my mom

101
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:45,316
and I wanted to smash
my way out of that house.

102
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,512
-Well, why were you so angry?
-Gee, I don't know.

103
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:51,712
Maybe it's because I was always
the subject of her little experiments.

104
00:05:52,119 --> 00:05:54,587
Did you get to the chapter
where she staged the Easter egg hunt

105
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:57,478
with no eggs to see how long
I'd keep looking?

106
00:05:58,799 --> 00:06:01,632
The answer, by the way: June.

107
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,439
Sweetie, I'm so sorry.

108
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,152
lwish there was something I could do
to make you feel better.

109
00:06:06,359 --> 00:06:10,352
-I do, too, but there's not.
-Really? Are you sure about that?

110
00:06:13,799 --> 00:06:16,154
Of course, who am | to argue
with a check-plus student?

111
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:19,512
Just warning you,
I'm gonna go right.

112
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,358
Don't make a big deal out of it.

113
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,558
ls makeup really necessary?

114
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:34,429
Well, when someone looks
at your dating profile,

115
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,033
the first thing they see is
your picture.

116
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,556
| just want to make sure
you look fun and full of life

117
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,479
and not like a body
theyjust pulled out of the river.

118
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:46,831
All right, here we go,
and... smile.

119
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,468
(CAMERA CLICKS)

120
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,235
Okay. That one's in the bank.

121
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,471
How about this? Turn away,
and then turn back into it.

122
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,678
But when you do, imagine the camera
is the girl you want to meet.

123
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:04,432
You got it.

124
00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:09,193
(CAMERA CLICKS)

125
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,637
Okay... let's try it again.

126
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,916
But this time, pretend the girl
you want to meet

127
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,111
doesn't want to hurt you.

128
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,270
I don't think I can give you that.

129
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,233
Come on. One more time.

130
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,909
(CAMERA CLICKS)

131
00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:38,314
Yeah, it's...
it's a little blurry,

132
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,198
but I think that works in your favor.

133
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,157
-Do you want a beer?
-Sure.

134
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,709
Hey, have you finished writing
your profile yet?

135
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:46,749
Almost.

136
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,713
Oh, what did you put as the one-word
description of yourself?

137
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,194
I put "unobjectionable."

138
00:07:53,359 --> 00:07:57,113
But now that I hear it out loud,
itjust seems like I'm being cocky.

139
00:07:57,239 --> 00:07:58,877
What did you put
for your best feature?

140
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,996
My parents' money.

141
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:04,796
What did you put
for your best feature?

142
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:06,831
I put "not applicable."

143
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,880
Come on, dude,
you're being too hard on yourself.

144
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,399
You've got a lot of good stuff
going on.

145
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,747
Really? Like what?

146
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,038
Well, okay, you're a talented artist.
You own your own business.

147
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,958
Neither of those things have
ever helped me meet a woman.

148
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:24,997
Okay, well, can we imply
that you're well-endowed?

149
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:29,750
I do have one oddly long testicle.

150
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,678
Okay, now you're talking like
a winner!

151
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,673
What you doing?

152
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:42,478
Oh, it turns out Amy's beloved
Pride arid Prejudice

153
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,596
is a flawless masterpiece.

154
00:08:45,719 --> 00:08:47,072
He's got too much pride,

155
00:08:47,199 --> 00:08:49,872
she's got too much prejudice--
it just works.

156
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,952
So you're looking to ruin something
for her in the funny pages?

157
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:56,913
Amy has a fondness
for the comic strip Marmaduke.

158
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,879
-And...?
-And I think I've got it.

159
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,589
Consider: Afamily possesses a dog
that is so large

160
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:08,195
and poorly disciplined,
he causes nothing but problems.

161
00:09:08,319 --> 00:09:09,638
Why do they keep him?!

162
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,712
Maybe they fell in love with him
as a PUPPY

163
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,398
and didn't know how big
he was gonna be.

164
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,309
Of course.

165
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,073
You know, why couldn't
she just like Ziggy? Yeah?

166
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,470
That thing's riddled with plot holes.

167
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:26,477
Sorry, buddy.

168
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,914
I think she's a fan of Garfield
as well.

169
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,155
(CHUCKLES)

170
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,510
Oh, darn it, now so am I.

171
00:09:33,319 --> 00:09:36,231
I'll see you later. I got to go watch
a stupid football game with Penny.

172
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,397
Wait, hang on.
You've spent time with Amy.

173
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,869
Can you think of anything
she's fond of

174
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:44,638
that has a bunch of flaws
she hasn't noticed?

175
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,158
I got to go.

176
00:09:56,319 --> 00:09:58,708
-You ready to go?
-Yep. Hey, and maybe this time,

177
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:01,552
you don't try and talk sports
with the guys.

178
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:03,437
Some sports bar.

179
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,278
It's like they never
even heard of Ouidditch.

180
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,474
Do we really have to go?

181
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,477
Oh, come on. Every time we're
about to hang out with my friends,

182
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:10,628
you don't want to.

183
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:13,068
It's like, "It's too loud,"
or "The bathroom's too dirty,"

184
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,754
or "They put a chicken wing
in my ear." I mean...

185
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,517
Well, you're right.
Let's just go.

186
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,995
-Hey, what's going on with you?
-Nothing, I'm fine.

187
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,234
All right, hang on.
Is this still about your mom's book?

188
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,635
No. Not everything is about my mom.

189
00:10:26,719 --> 00:10:28,869
'Cause if you're still upset
about that, we don't have to go.

190
00:10:28,999 --> 00:10:30,990
Except this is totally about my mom.

191
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:35,148
I'm so sorry.
I never should have read that book.

192
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,349
You know what? You want to just get
dinner and watch the game here?

193
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,917
-That sounds nice.
-Okay.

194
00:10:40,479 --> 00:10:42,117
Or, you know, we could get take-out

195
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,554
and watch the Blu-ray
extended version

196
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,796
of The Hobbit movie
with commentary track.

197
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,593
On account of how sad I am
about my mom.

198
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,675
Leonard, you ready for lunch?

199
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,835
One sec!

200
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,115
Hey. Sorry.

201
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:07,830
-Hi, Penny.
-Hi.

202
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:10,029
All right, sweetie.
You hang in there today.

203
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:11,990
I'll try, but I might be sad
again tonight.

204
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,950
Okay.

205
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,920
Wow! Sex at work?!

206
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,917
Leave it alone.
That's my girlfriend.

207
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:23,394
-Sorry.
-Who just had sex with me at work!

208
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:26,751
Damn.
How'd you swing that?

209
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,070
Whenever I talk about
how awful my mom was,

210
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,991
Penny will do anything
to make me feel better.

211
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:32,308
-Seriously?
-Look, I mean...

212
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,352
I'm not proud of it,
but it does work.

213
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,433
I got her to watch a six-part
documentary on Monty Python.

214
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:43,439
Even I was bored, ljust wanted
to see if she'd make it to the end.

215
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,630
You sound kind of proud of it.

216
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:47,875
-I am. I'm really proud.
-Yeah.

217
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,756
Hello, Sheldon.
Is everything okay?

218
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,717
Yes. Why?

219
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,188
Well, the last time you made
an unscheduled video chat,

220
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,197
there was a curly fry
in your regular fries

221
00:11:58,319 --> 00:12:00,753
and you thought someone might be
trying to slip you a mickey.

222
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:04,795
April 13...

223
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,638
a dark night, indeed.

224
00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:09,154
So what can I do for you?

225
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,350
I'm calling to invite you

226
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,794
to a spontaneous date night
tomorrow evening.

227
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,115
-ReaIIy?
-Yes.

228
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,038
You were kind enough to watch
Raiders of the Lost Ark with me.

229
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,199
So I'd like to return the favor
by inviting you to watch an episode

230
00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:26,152
of your favorite childhood
television series,

231
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,236
Little House on the Prairie.

232
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,670
That sounds lovely.

233
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,998
Why are you rubbing your hands
together?

00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,749

Are you in or not?

00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,353
Of course I'm in.

237
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,119
Excellent.
Then I shall see you tomorrow.

238
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,598
Good night, Dr. Fowler.

239
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,233
Good night, Dr. Cooper.

240
00:12:48,439 --> 00:12:50,475
Good night, indeed.

241
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:53,952
What a ru be.

242
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,548
Why would I put on lotion
when l have such soft hands?

243
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,553
You were really quiet during dinner.
Is everything okay?

244
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,114
Yeah. I guess I wasjust thinking
about my mom,

245
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:06,952
and how sad my childhood was.

246
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:09,954
Yeah, I bet it sucked.

247
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,558
I'm gonna take a bath.
You do the dishes.

248
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,878
How about I take a bath with you
and see what happens.

249
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,234
Here's what's gonna happen:

250
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,356
I'm gonna take a bath,
and you're gonna do the dishes.

251
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,273
That's it?
No compassion?

252
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,555

God, what is going on with you?

255
00:13:29,599 --> 00:13:31,988
l'm sharing my pain.

256
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,551
And I'm not buying it. Try again.

257
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:39,791
I'm learning to be a man in a culture

258

to know how.

261
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,759
When he does this to Penny,
they have sex and watch Monty Python.

262
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,118
-Howard!
-I know. It was dumb.

263
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,118
I shouldn't have done it.
And it's making me feel sad.

264
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,639
So sad.

265
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,270

I'll do the dishes.

does it make you feel exposed?

That's silly.

Almost as silly as Dr. Baker
having a telephone,

in large cities at that time.

00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:54,758
Bernadette told me everything.

345
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,950
Now you don't get the left
or the right.

346
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,434
Let's discuss why you continue
to involve me in your 59! life.

347
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:05,789
Oh, please, Mommy.
No, Mommy.

348
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,279
When you were six years old,

349
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,994
you walked in on me
and your father naked.

350
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:16,068
I was swatting his bottom with
your brand-new Ping-Pong paddle.

351
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:21,235
I didn't dream that?

352
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:24,954
How did that make you feel?

353
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:28,719
Penny, come back!
I'm sad for real now!

354
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:34,991
In the last two hours,
162 women have read our profiles.

355
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,394
How many of them
have sent us messages?

356
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,748
-Combined?
-Yes.

357
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,477
Zero.

358
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,553
Dude, this is... this is brutal.

359
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,712
I don't think I've ever felt
so rejected.

360
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:50,514
And I had a rescue dog
who ran back to the pound.

361
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,199
This is the worst.

362
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:55,508
If we're gonna get shot down,

363
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,870
we might as well just go to a bar
and do it old-school.

364
00:18:57,999 --> 00:19:01,355
-And make them look us in the eye.
-Yeah, anything is better than this.

365
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,996
-Hello.
-Not interested.

366
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,878
J“ (POP MUSIC PLAYS) J“

367
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,991
l was wrong. This is worse.

368
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,389
J“ (INDIANA JONES THEME PLAYS) J“

369
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,990
Wait, wait.
If it wasn't for Indiana Jones,

370
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,872
the ark would never have ended up
at the warehouse!

371
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:23,757
That's true!

372
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,759
He collected and delivered the ark
to the proper authorities for filing.

373
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:29,431
-Like a hero!
-Yes!

374
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,669
Although, technically,
lndy was supposed to take the ark

375
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,108
to a museum to be studied.
He couldn't even get that done.
