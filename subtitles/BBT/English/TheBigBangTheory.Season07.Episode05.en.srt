1
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:07,228
-What are you working on?
-Can't talk. In the zone.

2
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:09,917
-Do you know what he's doing?
-Could be anything.

3
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:11,472
Last time he was like this,
he figured out

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,352
electron transport in graphene.

5
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,311
The time before that,
he was making a list of who's allowed

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,555
in his tree fort if he ever gets one.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,551
Still can't believe
I didn't make the cut.

8
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:24,551
Sheldon, you want to take a break?
Your food's ready.

9
00:00:24,759 --> 00:00:27,876
No, what are you doing?
He's both happy and quiet.

10
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:30,877
It's like seeing a unicorn
and Bigfoot at the same time.

11
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:33,868
Sorry we're so late.

12
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,593
Bernadette got stuck at work.

13
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:38,757
Great news! A raccoon virus
just crossed the species barrier

14
00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:41,314
and now can infect humans!

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,588
Why is that great news?

16
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:45,630
In the pharmaceutical business,
we have a saying:

17
00:00:45,839 --> 00:00:46,988
"Mo' infections, mo' money."

18
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,072
Wait!

19
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,475
Maybe you want to wash
your little raccoon hands first.

20
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,114
Calm down.
If! had it, I'd be dead already.

21
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,070
Guys, listen up.

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,235
Can't listen, zone.

23
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,913
Also don't care.

24
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,070
Next week is the anniversary
of my first date with Bernadette.

25
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,191
Really don't care.

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,628
I want to do something special,

27
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,398
and l was hoping you guys
could be a part of it.

28
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,398
What horrible thing
are you trying to make up for?

29
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,398
Just putting something in the bank
for what horrible thing I do next.

30
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,197
Ah.

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,752
Look, she's gonna be back any second,
so here's the deal:

32
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,349
I'm writing a song, and hoping we
could all play it for her together.

33
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,471
-I love that.
-That is so beautiful.

34
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,908
Sheldon?

35
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,232
When did we get
to The Cheesecake Factory?

36
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:35,028
J“ (THEME SONG PLAYS) J“

37
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,554
It's really sweet what Howard
wants to do for Bernadette.

38
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,875
Yeah. Hey, how come
you've never done anything romantic

39
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,836
to celebrate our first date?

40
00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:06,595
Well, for starters, you've broken up
with me so many times,

41
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,676
which first date
are we talking about?

42
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,155
Whoa! Somebody call
the burn ward.

43
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,758
And back to the zone.

44
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,918
And besides, I do romantic things
for you all the time.

45
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,190
Can you even name one romantic thing
you've done for me?

46
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,868
-I can name tons.
-Sex doesn't count.

47
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,877
I know, what about
that bed-and-breakfast?

48
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,751
Well, I took you there.
All you did was...

49
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,678
I know what I did.

50
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,314
I bet they had to throw out
that rocking chair.

51
00:02:36,999 --> 00:02:39,069
You know, I can be romantic
if I want to.

52
00:02:39,279 --> 00:02:42,032
It's fine. And also not true.

53
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:44,918
Okay, just you wait and see.

54
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,156
I'm gonna romance
your freakin' ass off.

55
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,552
That's beautiful.
Is that Shakespeare?

56
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,995
-Sheldon?
-Zone.

57
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:57,748
He'll figure it out
when he falls off the roof.

58
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:03,589
Sheldon, I know you're in the zone,
but do you want some tea?

59
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,275
All right, I can't believe
I'm gonna say this, but

60
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,675
you haven't spoken in hours
and I'm starting to get worried.

61
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,949
Please say something.

62
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,596
Leonard, prepare to be humbled
and weep at the glory of my genius.

63
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,672
Nope, it was better before.

64
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,473
Look at it.

65
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,955
| feel like my mind just made a baby.

66
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,469
And it's beautiful.

67
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,399
It's not like human babies,
which are loud and covered in goop.

68
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,078
Holy crap, Sheldon,
did you just figure out a method

69
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:40,713
for synthesizing a new stable
super-heavy element?

70
00:03:41,559 --> 00:03:44,153
Did I?
Well, that can't be right.

71
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:47,237
No one's ever done that before.
Except me, because ljust did it!

72
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,237
J“ Sheldon and his brain, yeah!
Sheldon and his brain, yeah!

73
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,476
J“ Sheldon and his brain, yeah!
Sheldon and his brain, yeah!

74
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,240
-J' Sheldon and his brain... J“
-Definitely better before.

75
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,071
So, I'm almost done
writing the song for Bernadette.

76
00:04:01,279 --> 00:04:02,428
Are you cool playing the cello?

77
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:05,153
If by "cool"
you mean "willing to," yes.

78
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:06,792
If by "cool" you mean "cool,"

79
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:08,796
clearly you've never seen me
play the cello.

80
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:11,517
Great. Will you play the ukulele?

81
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:14,438
Of course. I'd be happy
to shred it on my ax.

82
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:19,309
Or you could just play your tiny,
ridiculous guitar.

83
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,391
Fine. lwill melt her heart.

84
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,236
And her face!

85
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,514
Gentlemen.

86
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,756
No doubt you heard
about my little breakthrough.

87
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,838
Now, if your plan
is to hoist me on your shoulders

88
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,076
and carry me around the cafeteria,
please refrain.

89
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,475
I don't care for heights,
motion sickness

90
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,034
or the thought of your necks
touching my buttocks.

91
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:45,471
Seriously, congratulations, Sheldon.

92
00:04:45,679 --> 00:04:46,907
Yeah, I read your paper online.

93
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:49,633
That technique for creating
a new heavy element is inspired.

94
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,319
Thank you.
Believe it or not,

95
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:53,669
ljust learned
a Chinese research team

96
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:55,517
at the Hubei Institute
for Nuclear Physics

97
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,233
ran a test on a cyclotron,

98
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,032
and the results
were extremely promising.

99
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,673
Sheldon, that's incredible.

100
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:02,995
I know! They called it
the greatest thing

101
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,712
since the Communist party.

102
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,389
Although I'm pretty sure that the
Communist party made them say that.

103
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,234
I like China.

104
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,431
See, they know how
to keep people in line.

105
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,348
So, what happens next?

106
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,074
More testing,
more success, more fame.

107
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,989
But don't worry, I will remain
the same down-to-earth humble Joe

108
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,077
-l've always been.
-Good to know.

109
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,635
Now give me that cookie;
I discovered an element.

110
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,872
Thank you so much for coming.

111
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,910
You called the right person.

112
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,236
I believe I have the perfect romantic
evening for you to give Leonard.

113
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,795
Okay, good,
'cause I've been really struggling with this.

114
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,069
As I'm sure you're aware,

115
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,635
the quickest way to a man's heart
is through his...

116
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,354
Pants, but Leonard says
sex doesn't count.

117
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,278
Hm. You poor thing.

118
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,590
You have one arrow in your quiver,
and you just can't use it.

119
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:55,632
Fortunately, another pathway
to a man's heart

120
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,115
is through his stomach.

121
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,514
I don't know if I want to cook
for him; he's kind of a picky eater.

122
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,188
I mean, "It's too salty.
It's too dry.

123
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,914
It's too burnt and frozen
at the same time."

124
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,351
Wait, come on, what else
would sweep you off your feet?

125
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,075
Well, I've always had this fantasy
that involves dancing.

126
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:17,830
The sexual chemistry between
my partner and me is electric.

127
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,190
But boy, oh, boy,
does my father not approve

128
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:23,038
until he sees us
in the big dance competition.

129
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:26,037
Okay, that's just the plot
for Dirty Dancing.

130
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,158
What else would you love,
other than

131
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:31,998
being lifted
over Patrick Swayze's head?

132
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,237
Oh, oh. You could
stand outside his window

133
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:37,555
with a boom box in the air.

134
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:41,751
That's from Say Anything.

135
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:45,228
Look, I'm a lonely guy;
I watch a lot of movies.

136
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,589
Look, Penny,

137
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,758
if you truly want to be romantic,
it needs to come from you.

138
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,871
| get that, but why is this so hard?

139
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,434
Well, you've probably never had
to do this stuff 'cause you're young

140
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:57,630
and beautiful and men have
always thrown themselves at you.

141
00:07:00,239 --> 00:07:02,594
Yeah, I'm trying to be sad
about that. I can't.

142
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,871
Let's see, what's next?
Okay! Here.

143
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,751
This is the Magic Marker

144
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,030
l was using
when I made the discovery.

145
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,831
I don't think the Smithsonian's
gonna want your marker.

146
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,157
And that's why you're not
on the list for my tree fort.

147
00:07:22,239 --> 00:07:23,797
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

148
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:26,836
Ooh! Guess who's getting an article

149
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,439
written about him in Physics Today?

150
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,992
I'll give you a hint.

151
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,919
You measured the diameter
of his suspicious mole yesterday.

152
00:07:35,359 --> 00:07:36,587
Sheldon, I'm so proud of you.

153
00:07:36,799 --> 00:07:39,711
Well, you should be. My discovery
is spreading like wildfire.

154
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,956
Unlike my mole, which is holding
steady at the size of a navy bean.

155
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,950
What's next?

156
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,878
This is the very copy

157
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,116
of The Handbook
of Chemistry and Physics

158
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,471
in which I looked up the reaction
rates of mendelevium and....

159
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:56,833
-And what?
-No.

160
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,668
-No, no, no, no.
-What's wrong?

161
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,677
I've made a horrible mistake.

162
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,790
What are you talking about?

163
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,798
This table,
it's in square centimeters.

164
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,433
| read it as square meters.

165
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,754
You know what that means?

166
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,076
That Americans can't handle
the metric system?

167
00:08:16,719 --> 00:08:19,472
Amy, I was off by a factor of 10,000.

168
00:08:20,359 --> 00:08:22,077
But the Chinese team
found the element.

169
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,953
They shouldn't have.
My calculations were wrong.

170
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,720
There must be some resonance between
the elements I didn't know about.

171
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,398
So you just got lucky?

172
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,353
Sheldon Cooper does not get lucky!

173
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,792
You and me both, brother.

174
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,555
It doesn't matter.
The element was found because of you,

175
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:40,908
and that's groundbreaking.

176
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,509
What matters is
the greatest scientific achievement

177
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,711
of my life is based on a blunder.

178
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:48,228
I'm not a genius, I'm a fraud.

179
00:08:49,719 --> 00:08:50,834
You know, Sheldon, in neuroscience,

180
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:53,155
we're forever finding something
in one part of the brain

181
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,349
that we thought was someplace else.

182
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,792
Great. Now I'm worse than
a fraud. l'm practically a biologist.

183
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,272
You got to stop beating
yourself up over this.

184
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,675
I mean, you made a mistake,
but it was a happy mistake.

185
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:11,676
There's nothing happy about it.

186
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:14,154
I'm being given credit
that I don't deserve.

187
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,510
People get things
they don't deserve all the time.

188
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:19,150
Look at me with you.

189
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,314
No, Leonard, this is going
to haunt me for the rest of my life:

190
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:26,592
every science classroom, every
periodic table, every textbook.

191
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,473
This mistake
will be staring back at me

192
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,797
Like that time you let Koothrappali
wax your eyebrows.

193
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:36,956
I've got to find a way
to stop this thing.

194
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:40,549
Buddy, I don't think you can. I mean,
once it's out there, it's out there.

195
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:43,831
This thing is like the science
equivalent of a sex tape.

196
00:09:45,439 --> 00:09:46,952
Frankly, I'd prefer a sex tape.

197
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:48,672
You don't know
what a sex tape is, do you?

198
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:49,868
No.

199
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,279
Make sure you guys get
to the restaurant by 8:00.

200
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,754
Bernadette's
meeting me there at 8:30.

201
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:57,631
-I don't want to blow the surprise.
-We'll be there.

202
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,115
Got it. Now, l have
a question about the song.

203
00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:04,595
l was thinking at some point
I could bust out a little rap.

204
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,277
Nah, nah, nuh, nuh, nuh, no.

205
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,114
Come on, come on,
you haven't even heard it yet.

206
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:15,513
Leonard, give me a beat.

207
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:17,357
lwill not.

208
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:19,708
Please?

209
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,309
-No, I want this to be romantic.
-It will be!

210
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,829
I don't call anyone a ho,
and the only time

211
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:27,599
I use the phrase "my bitch,"
I'm referring to you.

212
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,556
MAN: There he is!
(APPLAUSE)

213
00:10:33,319 --> 00:10:35,787
Stop it. Stop celebrating me!

214
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,634
Woo!

215
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:39,715
And no woos!

216
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:41,068
Not you, Dr. Woo, you're fine.

217
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,392
I want you all to know that
you have no reason to applaud me.

218
00:10:48,599 --> 00:10:52,035
My so-called breakthrough
wasn't the result of my genius.

219
00:10:52,239 --> 00:10:54,434
It was nothing more
than a boneheaded mistake.

220
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:58,029
So please refrain from praising me
for it in the future.

221
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:00,277
I don't understand.
They didn't find the element?

222
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,311
No, they found the element.

223
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,755
(APPLAUSE)
No, no, stop it!

224
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,915
I don't need to take this admiration
from the likes of you people!

225
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,311
-How do | make them stop loving me?
-lnvite them to live with us.

226
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,231
Boy, Bernadette is gonna love this.

227
00:11:18,439 --> 00:11:22,114
It must be nice to have someone
do something so romantic.

228
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,359
Okay, you know what's not romantic?

229
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,834
Rubbing it in someone's face.

230
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,032
Actually, it can be,
but I told you sex doesn't count.

231
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,151
I'm getting worried about Bernadette.
I'm gonna call and check on her.

232
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,951
The National Science Foundation
wants to give me a substantial grant.

233
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:41,309
-That's a big deal.
-I know.

234
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,238
When will this nightmare end?

235
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,357
Hey, I get that you feel bad about
all the attention,

236
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,393
but still, what you did is amazing.
We're really proud of you.

237
00:11:49,599 --> 00:11:52,432
-l'm not.
-You're not?

238
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,028
Sheldon, I've been thinking about it,

239
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,708
and you're right,
you don't deserve any credit.

240
00:11:58,599 --> 00:12:01,033
All you did was misread
some numbers on a table.

241
00:12:01,239 --> 00:12:02,513
A very easy table, too.

242
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:05,597
Honestly, l'm embarrassed for you.

243
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:09,870
That's the most romantic thing
I've ever heard.

244
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,872
Damn it, everyone's
better at this than me.

245
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:18,310
Congratulations, Dr. Fowler.
You just made the fort.

246
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,751
Guys, there was an accident
at Bernie's lab.

247
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:25,233
My God, is she okay?

248
00:12:25,439 --> 00:12:27,634
Yeah, but she's at the hospital
in quarantine.

249
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,352
-What?
-Poor Bernadette.

250
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,711
I hate to pile on the bad news,
but ljust got a raise.

251
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,674
My God, Bernie, what happened?

252
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:46,234
Well, let's just say the next time
you move a dozen vials

253
00:12:46,439 --> 00:12:49,317
of raccoon virus to the fridge,
make two trips.

254
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,469
You're sure you're okay?

255
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,716
Yeah, it's just a precaution.
If there was a problem,

256
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:57,149
I'd be throwing up
out of my eyeballs by now.

257
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:01,514
-Sorryl messed up our date.
-No, don't worry about it.

258
00:13:01,719 --> 00:13:03,277
I brought the date here.

259
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,993

261
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,471
Well, tonight is the anniversary
of our first date,

262
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:14,069
and I wanted to celebrate it
by writing a song for you.

a rough enough day?

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,515
No, something's going on.
What's wrong with it?

341
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,915
I remember you saying how great
it would be to have a first edition.

342
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,398
It's true, I did. I did say that...

343
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,795
...when we were at
the used bookstore together

344
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,753
and I saw the first edition
and I bought it.

345
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,237
Oh my God, I am the worst!

346
00:17:30,439 --> 00:17:31,872
No, no, it's okay.
It's really thoughtful.

347
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,638
No, it's not! I mean...

348
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,030
What's thoughtful
is everything you do.

349
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,997
Here, you know what?
Look at this.

350
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,796
Look, here's the...
the plane ticket you bought me

351
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,070
when l was too poor
to go home for the holidays.

352
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:51,067
And the rose you left
on my windshield... just because.

353
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,712
Here's the thank-you letter
you wrote me

354
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,398
after the first time
I slept with you.

355
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,553
All 11 pages of it.

356
00:18:01,879 --> 00:18:03,437
Can't believe
you saved all this stuff.

357
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,150
Of course I did. It's you.

358
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,748
Come here.

359
00:18:15,439 --> 00:18:17,555
Is that a pregnancy test?

360
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,149
Just the first one.
I didn't save them all.

361
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:28,677
I can't believe
I read this table wrong.

362
00:18:28,879 --> 00:18:30,153
I blame you.

363
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,468
Me? What did I do?

364
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:34,953
You distract me.

365
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:37,434
I've been distracted
since the moment I met you.

366
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:41,669
-Sorry.
-Well, you should be.

367
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,190
Because all I can think about
is how much I want to kiss you.

368
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,390
And not just on the cheek,
but on the mouth.

369
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,956
Like mommies and daddies do.

370
00:18:59,719 --> 00:19:01,118
Oh, Sheldon.

371
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:07,268
SHELDON: Amy?

372
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,917
Amy? Did you hear what I said?

373
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,519
Can't talk, in the zone.

374
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,271
