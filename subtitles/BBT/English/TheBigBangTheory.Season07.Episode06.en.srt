I've never seen him
this happy before.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,110
It's because you've never seen him an

I can't wait until I get a rash.

8
00:00:23,319 --> 00:00:25,879
Oh, Gas-X has a new ultra strength.

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,431
I guess they really do
read their mail.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,309
Hey, isn't that Professor Proton ?

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,748
Oh, yeah.

12
00:00:38,199 --> 00:00:40,394
Look at him, just standing in line,

13
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,518
like he wasn't moderately
famous 30 years ago.

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,268
Let's go say hello.

15
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,515
Oh, maybe we shouldn't bother him.

16
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,551
I'm not going to bother him,
I'm going to talk to him.

17
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,152
He thinks there's a difference.

19
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,356
Arthur, it's me, Sheldon Cooper.

20
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,677
You may not remember
because of your advanced age.

21
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,195
Trust me, I... I remember.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,479
This is my girlfriend, Amy.

23
00:01:06,679 --> 00:01:08,510
Amy, this is television
legend Arthur Jeffries.

24
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:12,394
His science show
inspired millions of children.

25
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:15,033
Hold... Hold on.

26
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,549
You... You have a girlfriend?

27
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:20,510
Yes, and I've heard
so much about you.

Hey, look, we're wearing
the same orthopedic shoes.

29
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,950
I can't believe I dress
like a celebrity.

00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:31,549
Okay, I get it now.

31
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,316
Dr. Jeffries, hello again.
Leonard Hofstadter.

32
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:38,431
Oh, oh, right,
I remember your girlfriend.

33
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:43,397
Is she... is she here?

34
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,998
No, she's not.

35
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,797
So, what prescription
are you getting filled?

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,194
-Sheldon.
-No. Wait, I want to guess.

37
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:50,309
Don't tell me.

38
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:52,749
I wasn't going to tell you.

39
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:54,868
Sheldon, come on.

40
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,956
No, no, no. I'm really good at this.
All right, give me a hint.

41
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,948
Does it involve difficulty initiating
a stream of anything?

42
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,314
Well, given my age,
that's more than just a lucky guess.

43
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,031
Hey, Sheldon,
let's go mock the people

44
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,834

You love that.

45
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:14,109
But I'm hanging out with my friend,
and we're having fun.

46
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,992

-Actually, I'm busy.
-Doing what?

00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:53,589
There's a new sports bar
over on Colorado Ave.

-You're going to girls' night.
-Yeah.

You know
they're making jewelry, right?

55
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:01,511
You think they came up with that?

56
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,994
They were going
to drink beer and play darts.

-Not his testosterone levels.

Excuse me. I happen to be very
comfortable with my masculinity.

Goody! What's it say?

63
00:03:23,999 --> 00:03:26,593
He's working on a paper
about nano vacuum tubes,

64
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,472
and wants to know
if I'd take a look at it.

65
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:30,713
That's strange,

66
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,069
that he would come to you
for that and not me.

67
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,232
Oh, I got two emails from him.

68
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,399

"Never mind, lfound it."

71
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,036
I can't believe
he picked you over me.

72
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,674
You don't want to read a paper
by some old has-been

At the end of the day he's just
another Hollywood phony.

getting upset about?

They say don't meet your heroes.

82
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,079
Don't peek behind
that curtain of fame and celebrity,

83
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,999
because if you do,
you'll see them as they really are:

Yes, l have.

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,947
And my only conclusion is the
prescription he was picking up

the other day was for cuckoo pills.

93
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:55,356
Maybe he found you a bit much.

94
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,631
That's kind of a stretch.

95
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:01,672
Look, when it comes to social skills,
l've mastered the big three.

From what I saw the other day,

103
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,477
I could understand why he and...

104
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,910

105
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,429
What?

106
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,638
Doesn't matter.

107
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,956
No, go ahead, say it.

108
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,594
I know what it is.
I've heard it my whole life.

109
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,836
The word's "annoying".
Go ahead, say it.

110
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:42,109
Say it. Say I'm annoying.

111
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:44,275
-Sheldon...
-Oh, it won't hurt my feelings.

Yeah, now where are you going?

00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,710
Look, you know you want
to say it. Say it.

116
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,549
Say I'm annoying. Go ahead, say it.

117
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,638

00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:08,557

a vixen wearing jewelry

of medications l'm allergic to.

Penny, how's it going over there?

123
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:16,876
Good. I'm just having
little trouble with the glue.

How do you not know how to use glue?
Did you ditch pre-school?

Yeah, but only because
I was dating a second grader.

Nope, Bernadette told me
it isn't nice and I'm not allowed.

130
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,471
-Thank you.
-So I won't be making fun of you,

131
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:42,830
or the things you like, or the fact
that you just want to have fu-un.

132
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,678
Howie, stop.
Come on, look at what I'm making.

133
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,035
Oh, that's actually pretty nice.

-Yeah, I'm just making a mess.

135
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,554
You know, instead of beads and glue,

136
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,988
you guys can use my soldering iron.

137
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,918
You'd be able to make
much cooler stuff.

138
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,112
Oh, I think we're doing
just fine, thank you.

139
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,550
Actually, l'd kind of like
to try that.

-Me, too.
-Be right back.

00:07:11,239 --> 00:07:13,469

00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,959
Arthur.

144
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,070
Arthur.

00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:26,591
Door knocker.

146
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,438
That's TV money.

147
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,838
Sheldon, what are you doing here?

148
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,474
I'm sorry. Did lwake you?

149
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,829
Of course you woke me.
It's 7:30.

150
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,159
Well, lwould have been here sooner,
but for some reason your home

151
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,953
isn't on this map of Hollywood stars.

152
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,392
What do you want, Sheldon?

153
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,351
It's been pointed out
by my girlfriend

154
00:07:51,559 --> 00:07:54,232
that I may have been annoying to you.

155
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:56,230
She sounds like a keeper.

156
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,398
Anyway, I wanted to apologize.
I am truly sorry.

157
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,391
All right, apology accepted.
Have a nice night.

158
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,114
Now that we've cleared the air,

159
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,469
I wanted to discuss
another matter with you.

160
00:08:08,679 --> 00:08:11,273
Sheldon, in a couple hours,
l have to get up,

161
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,789
pee and then wander
around the house.

162
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:22,589
Well, then, I'll make this quick.

163
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:25,267
I want to talk about the paper
you sent Leonard.

164
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,595
Now, I know he said it's promising

165
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,592
and he's going to collaborate on it,

166
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:32,514
but now that you and l are friends
again, lam at your disposal.

167
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,278
And, frankly, lending my name

168
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,948
and reputation to it will help,
because a lot of people think

169
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,720
that you're a washed-up has-been.

170
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,797
Or dead.

171
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,353
I should be so lucky.

172
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,389
So, what do you say?

173
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,798
You know,
if it's all the same with you,

174
00:08:49,999 --> 00:08:51,398
I think I'll stick with Leonard.

175
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:55,390
It's because I'm annoying, right?
I know it is. Say it.

176
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,828
Say it. Say I'm annoying.

177
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,109
-Good night.
-Say it.

178
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,074
Arthur, say it.
Say I'm annoying. Say it. Say it.

179
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,997
l'm annoying. Say it.

180
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,314
You're annoying!

181
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,749
Wow, that really hurt.

182
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,272
If you would have told me
when l was a kid

183
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,072
that someday
I would be doing science

184
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,073
next to Professor Proton,
I would not have believed you.

185
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,510
If someone had told me that people
would still call me Professor Proton

186
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,995
when l was 83 years old,

187
00:09:29,199 --> 00:09:30,917
I never would have quit smoking.

188
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:36,193
I'm sorry, Dr. Jeffries,
I'm just excited.

189
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,278
This nano vacuum tube idea
of yours, it's really interesting.

190
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,914
Hello, Leonard. Oh, hello, Arthur.

191
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,350
What an odd coincidence
that you're both here.

192
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,754
Why is it odd?

193
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,679
Because as it just so happens,
I'm also spending the day

194
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,633
with a beloved children's
television science personality.

195
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,990
Isn't that right,
new friend and colleague,

196
00:09:54,199 --> 00:09:55,427
Bill Nye the Science Guy.

197
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,079
Sorry, I replaced you
with a newer model.

198
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,679
Wow, Arthur Jeffries.

199
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:06,914
It's an honor to meet you.

200
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,156
My show never would
have happened without yours.

201
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,078
That's what I told my lawyers.

202
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,628
Mr. Nye, hello. I'm sorry he got
you involved in this nonsense.

203
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,910
He said I'd be speaking to a class.

204
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,192
No, I said you were teaching
someone a lesson. Now let's go.

205
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,434
What are you guys working on?

206
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,473
Oh, we're making nano vacuum tubes.

207
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,668
-That's interesting.
-Haven't you stolen enough from me?

208
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:34,870
Back off, bow tie!

209
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:42,757
Hey, guys, what do you think?

210
00:10:43,599 --> 00:10:44,952
Wow, Penny, good job.

211
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,720
Thanks. Target, 4.99.
I'm getting a drink.

212
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:52,199
-What are you working on?
-l'm making a necklace for my mom.

213
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,309
That's sweet.

214
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,431
Yeah, she and my dad are
going through a bit of a rough patch,

215
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,915
so I wanted to do something to let
her know I was thinking about her.

216
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,155
What's going on with them?

217
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,635
They're just having
a little trouble communicating.

218
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,876
My dad says it's because
the sound of my mom's voice

219
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,956
makes him want to tear his ears off
and sew them over his eyes

220
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,229
so he never has to look at her again.

221
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,194
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

222
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,509
-Hi.
-Hey, guys.

223
00:11:11,719 --> 00:11:14,791
Look who's here to put
the "Jew" in "Jewelry Night."

224
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,229
Oh, sure,
so it's fine when you say it.

225
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,159
Sorry we're late.
I wanted to swing by the lab

226
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,272
and pick up some even
cooler tools for us to use.

227
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,789
-I didn't know you were coming again.
-Well, last week was a blast.

228
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:31,433
Plus, lthought you might
like having a guy here.

229
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,673
It was not funny.

230
00:11:37,999 --> 00:11:39,114
So, what tools did you bring?

231
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,753
Everything we need
to make jewelry molds.

232
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,472
Here's some silver, a crucible

233
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,432
and an acetylene torch
to melt it down.

234
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:46,357
Ooh! That looks like fun.

235
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,472
Maybe you should master glue
before you move on to fire.

236
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:52,027
Okay, who's up first?

237
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,232
Rajesh, want to make a bracelet
for your mom to go with the necklace?

238
00:11:55,439 --> 00:11:56,667
No, thanks.

239
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:58,312
l was gonna make
a necklace for my mom,

240
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,351
but unfortunately,
she doesn't have a neck.

241
00:12:02,319 --> 00:12:05,516
She's just chins and fat and feet.

242
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,193
Okay, we're almost ready to go.

243
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:13,469
Once we bond the wires,
we can test the tubes.

244
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:16,432
This is so exciting, I feel...

245
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,516
like I'm 15 again.

246
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,075
on, God.

247
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,395
What... what is it?

248
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,239
Sheldon just sent me a picture of him
and Bill Nye getting smoothies.

249
00:12:31,999 --> 00:12:34,433
-Can I ask you a question?
-Yeah, sure.

250
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,918
Why do you put up with Sheldon?

251
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,716
Oh.

252
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:40,511
You know, because we're friends.

253
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,592
Why?

254
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,638
Wow, you ask really hard questions.

255
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,034
Yeah.

256
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,310
Look, I know he can be aggravating,

257
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,158
but what you have to remember is that
he's not doing it on purpose.

258
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,509
It's just how he is.

259
00:12:55,719 --> 00:12:58,517
But he's also loyal and trustworthy

260
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,039
and we have fun together.

261
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:03,311
You know you're describing a dog.

262
00:13:05,319 --> 00:13:06,434
He did bite me once.

263
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,393
But in his defense, I came up
behind him while he was eating.

264
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,072
Yeah, they hate that.

265
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,279
You know what, Sheldon is the
smartest person I have ever met.

266
00:13:20,479 --> 00:13:22,629
He's a little broken
and he needs me.

267
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,798
I guess I need him, too.

268
00:13:26,479 --> 00:13:27,389
Why is that?

269
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,912
Boy, you will not
let this go, will you?

270
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:33,868
Oh, geez.

271
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:35,558
Another photo from Sheldon?

272
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:36,987
No, l have to go pick him up.

273
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:39,269
Bill Nye ditched him
at the smoothie place.

274
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,156
He probably stole his wallet, too.

275
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,068
You know, if you guys are interested,

276
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,315
there's a technique
where I can take a lock of your hair,

277
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,556
refine it into carbon dust,
and use the hydraulic press at work

278
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:57,671
to turn it into a tiny little diamond
with your DNA in it.

279
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,278
Oh, that's amazing!

280
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,708
Yeah. See Bernie's engagement ring?

281
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,229
That came right off my mom's back.

282
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:05,948
He's kidding.

283
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,515
If that were true,
it'd be so much bigger.

284
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,636
"My name is Howard.
I can make your hair into diamonds.

285
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,355
My mom is morbidly obese.
Everybody love me."

286
00:14:17,479 --> 00:14:19,037
Whoa, where is that coming from?

287
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,117
I'll tell you where it's coming from.

288
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,912
All you do is make fun of me
for coming to girls' night,

289
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,633
and now you're here ruining it
for everyone.

290
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:28,309
Raj, cool it.
He's gonna make us hair diamonds.

291
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,434
How am | ruining anything?

292
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,358
I'm just trying to help you
make betterjewelry.

293
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,198
But this isn't about the jewelry.

294
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,676
This is about me having a place where
I can open up about my feelings.

295
00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:40,958
Since when can't you open up
with me?

296
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:42,387
There are just some things

297
00:14:42,599 --> 00:14:44,157
that | feel more comfortable
sharing with the girls,

298
00:14:44,359 --> 00:14:45,951
because they won't make fun of me

299
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,914
or and call me names, or ask me if my
"Koothrapanties are in a bunch."

300
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,953
Buddy, l was just joking around.

301
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,752
Yeah, well,
sometimes yourjokes hurt.

302
00:14:57,959 --> 00:14:58,914
(SIGHS)

303
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,155
You're right.

304
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:02,919
I didn't realize
I was making you feel that way.

305
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:06,949
It was very brave of you to tell me.

306
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,354
Thank you.

307
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,630
It wasn't easy.

308
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,598
They're gonna have sex
before Sheldon and I do. I knew it.

309
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,111
-Arthur.
-Hi, Sheldon.

310
00:15:22,319 --> 00:15:23,832
I'm surprised to see you here.

311
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,473
Yeah, me, too.

312
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,591
Somewhere around the third floor,

313
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,712
I began to see a white light.

314
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:33,994
I'll get Leonard.

315
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,678
No, no, no, I'm...

316
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:37,551
I'm here to see you.

317
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,513
If you're hoping to get in touch
with Bill Nye, I can't help you.

318
00:15:41,719 --> 00:15:44,836
I've been informed that he's now
Bill Nye the Restraining Order Guy.

319
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,955
No, I'm... lwas thinking,
if it isn't too much trouble,

320
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:54,151
I'd like to get your opinion
about my paper.

321
00:15:55,319 --> 00:15:57,230
Thank you. It would be an honor.

322
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,990
Oh, great.

323
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,678
Well, actually, I don't need that.

324
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:03,268
l hacked into your e-mail
account and read it.

325
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,716
And... what did you think?

326
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,036
Well, first, I think the fact

327
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,552
that you use your birthday
as a password is embarrassing.

328
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:16,068
Thank you.

329
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,312
Second...

330
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,396
I thought your paper was inspired.

331
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,750
Oh, well, that...
that means a lot to me.

332
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,829
Can I invite you in for tea?

333
00:16:27,439 --> 00:16:30,272
No, no. I really... I have to run.

334
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,469
Hey, Arthur. How are you?

335
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,352
Well, I guess one cup wouldn't hurt.

336
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,075
Hey, buddy, what's up?

337
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,748
Well, lwas feeling bad
about how I acted the other night

338
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:47,950
sol made you a little something.

339
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,515
-You didn't have to do that.
-Well, it was fun.

340
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,756
| used some of the jewelry techniques
you taught us.

341
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,638
(CHUCKLES)

342
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,473
It's a lightsaber belt buckle.

343
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,311
This is so cool. Thanks.

344
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,316

episode of Professor Proton

354
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,959
was "Alka-Seltzer Rocket."

and we can shoot it
at Bill Nye's house.
