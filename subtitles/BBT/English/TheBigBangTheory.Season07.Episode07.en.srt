1
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:05,310
-Hey, can I ask you a question?
-Sure.

2
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:06,554
You've had this dart board
since I've known you.

3
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:07,754
But I've never seen you play.

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,110
Oh, we played... once.

5
00:00:10,319 --> 00:00:11,911
I broke a window.

6
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:13,074
What window?

7
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:14,758
That one over there.

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,150
Leonard,
where are the Skee-Ball tickets?

9
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:19,428
Skee-Ball tickets?

10
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,756
Yeah, from when we went
to the arcade three years ago?

11
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,552
I finally decided what prize I want.

12
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:26,714
Hurry up.

13
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,237
If I still have them,
they're probably in the junk box.

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,794
-Ooh, what are you gonna get?
-None of your business.

15
00:00:33,999 --> 00:00:37,150
But when you see me wearing
aflower in my lapel later,

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,191
you are most welcome to sniff it.

17
00:00:41,199 --> 00:00:43,713
-Yup, got 'em, here you go.
-Oh, thank you.

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,514
Here, get yourself an eraser
for your troubles.

19
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:51,277
Oh, I forgot about this.

20
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,030
My aunt made it for me
when I started college.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,468
Aw, did she hate you?

22
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:02,316
Why? Because I got an ugly,
itchy sweater,

23
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,909
and my brother got a car?
No, l was her favorite.

24
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,388
Yeah, I seem to be
a few tickets short.

25
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:08,947
Are there more in the box?

26
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:10,752
I think I got them all.

27
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,598
Nope, they're not in there.

28
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,596
Well, you barely looked. Let me see.

29
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,269
No, no, no, I looked, and...
No more tickets.

30
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,596
-Leonard, let me look in the box.
-Okay, Okay!

31
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:25,398
I'm gonna show you what's in the box.
but just... promise not to flip out?

32
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:29,069
Why would I flip out? Is it a spider?

33
00:01:29,279 --> 00:01:30,428
(GASPS)
It's a spider!

34
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,553
No, if it was a spider,
Lenny would've flipped out.

35
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:39,469
Okay, Sheldon, I know I was supposed
to return this DVD a long time ago,

36
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,477
and I know we
rented it on your card.

37
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,557
But it's been, like, seven years,

38
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,113
and clearly nothing bad has happened.

39
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,359
So instead of being a giant
pain in the ass, like you always are,

40
00:01:49,559 --> 00:01:53,472
what if this one time
you just tried staying calm?

41
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,679
That seems like a reasonable request.

42
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:05,318
Although so did, "Hey, Leonard,
would you mind returning that DVD?"

43
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,077
I'm sorry. I'll take care of it.

44
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:11,393
Okay.

45
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,275
I mean it. I'm going to.

46
00:02:15,279 --> 00:02:16,917
I believe you.

47
00:02:18,559 --> 00:02:20,117
And you're going to stay calm?

48
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,230
I said I would.

49
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,190
How about that?

50
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:32,277
Sheldon's being reasonable.

51
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,391
Yeah, it's freaking me out.
I'm gonna go.

52
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:39,392
J“ (THEME SONG PLAYS) J“

53
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,356
So... when you say

54
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:05,914
you're not going
to freak out about the DVD,

55
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,599
here's what that means.

56
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,079
Don't fixate on it,

57
00:03:10,279 --> 00:03:11,951
don't wake me up
in the middle of the night,

58
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,232
or nag me through the door
while I'm on the toilet.

59
00:03:16,559 --> 00:03:18,948
Okay, first, talking to you
while you're on the toilet

60
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:21,309
isn't exactly a picnic for me either.

61
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,032
Remember, when you can hear me,
I can hear you.

62
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,876
And, second,
you completely disregard

63
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,753
how uncomfortable
unresolved issues are for me.

64
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,270
It's like, an itch in my brain
I can't scratch.

65
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,515
When I broke my arm I used
to stick a coat hanger down there.

66
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:44,467
You ever try that?
Maybe go in through the ear?

67
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:46,914
You wouldn't make jokes
if you could feel the way I feel.

68
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,272
Well, I don't know how to do that.

69
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,637
How about this?

70
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,434
I promise I won't pester you
about the DVD.

71
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,872
You can defecate in peace.
That's a win for both of us.

72
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:01,307
But...

73
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,669
until this matter is resolved,

74
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:05,153
lwould like you

75
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:06,917
to wear this sweater.

76
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:11,595
With nothing underneath it.

77
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,068
That's stupid. Why?

78
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:17,873
You say it's itchy and uncomfortable.

79
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,719
I say situations like this
make me feel the same way.

80
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:23,433
I'm telling you, try the hanger.

81
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,039
Put it on.

82
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,592
Let's share the experience.

83
00:04:29,239 --> 00:04:30,991
You got it.

84
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,429
If this sweater shuts you up,
I'm gonna make a fortune

85
00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:35,317
selling them to everyone we know.

86
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,678
Now all I need to do

87
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,956
is head down to the video store

88
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,030
and return the DVD.

89
00:04:46,799 --> 00:04:49,154
Oh, did I forget to tell you?

90
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:52,431
That store went out
of business years ago.

91
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,875
Really?

92
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,993
How those nipples feeling, chief?

93
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,592
Penny, can we please get our drinks?

94
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,915
Yeah, hang on, just give me sec.

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,560
At work today, I did
an in vivo stereotaxic surgery.

96
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,116
Cool. At my lab, I performed
ten laser capture micro-dissections.

97
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:17,277
l scraped gum
off the bottom of that table.

98
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:20,152
Only because my manager
saw me put it there.

99
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,955
Oh, my gosh.

100
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,037
That's the girl
that broke Rajesh's heart.

101
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:25,228
That's Lucy?

102
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,590
I don't know why but I always
pictured her as Indian.

103
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,711
I think that reason's called racism.

104
00:05:31,559 --> 00:05:32,469
I'm gonna go talk to her.

105
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,432
Why? What are you gonna say?

106
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,516
I'm not gonna say anything.
I just want to check her out.

107
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,474
Because she hurt my friend.
My lndian friend.

108
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,113
Who's racist now?

109
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:45,550
You because you just called him
your "lndian friend."

110
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,668
Yeah, well, you're short.

111
00:05:51,599 --> 00:05:53,191
We're never getting our drinks.

112
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,992
No, but we knew that.

113
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:57,792
Hey, can I start you off
with something to drink?

114
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,070
-Oh, water would be great.
-Okay.

115
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,908
You're Lucy, right?
I'm a friend of Raj Koothrappali's.

116
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:05,472
Actually Amy recognized you.

117
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,918
Wow. How's he doing?

118
00:06:15,119 --> 00:06:16,393
Oh, you know, he's good.

119
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:17,509
Great.

120
00:06:17,719 --> 00:06:19,710
Yeah, this is none of my business.

121
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,672
But why did you break up
with him in an e-mail?

122
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,999
Oh, I don't know.

123
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,918
I guess I thought it would be easier.

124
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,797
Yeah, I get that.
I'll go get you your water.

125
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,068
When you say "easier,"

126
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,759
you mean easier for you, right?

127
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,836
'Cause it certainly
didn't make it easier for him.

128
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,917
Any chance I can get
a different waitress?

129
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,997
I'm sorry, this is rude of me.
I will get that water.

130
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,997
See, see, see, see.

131
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,156
Just now you expressed
your feelings to my face.

132
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:52,792
How come you could do that
with me, but not with Raj?

133
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,070
I don't know your e-mail.

134
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,915
You know what the worst part is?
You're sitting here, perfectly happy

135
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:00,837
and he's at home, a blubbering mess.

136
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,268
Oh, I thought you said he was okay.

137
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,119
I also said I was getting you water,
but look at me still standing here.

138
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,713
You know, I may be a bad waitress,
but you are a bad person.

139
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,831
Now, you want to hear the specials?

140
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,998
-So, you can never take it off?
-No.

141
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,189
Not even to sleep?

142
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,549
No.

143
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,478
So, you're just an idiot?

144
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:42,593
It's called proving a point.

145
00:07:42,799 --> 00:07:44,471
Is the point you're an idiot?

146
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,313
Gentlemen, please.

147
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:50,875
Leonard is trying to walk
a mile in my metaphorical shoes.

148
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,071
He can't walk in my actual shoes.

149
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,871
He has the feet of a toddler.

150
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,793
So, how are you gonna return the DVD
if the store went out of business?

151
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:03,990
Monday morning I'll go downtown,
look up the owner's information,

152
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,555
send him the DVD.

154

Pay the late fee...

155
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,111
and prove to Sheldon
that you can have a problem...

156
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,753
and solve it...

157
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:18,793
without acting
like a complete lunatic.

158
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,109
Ahh!

159
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,710
And the man impersonating a bear
would like everyone to know that,

Only you can prevent forest fires.

161
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:29,749
I don't get it.

162
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,998
You didn't have
Smokey the Bear in India?

163
00:08:32,199 --> 00:08:34,667
No. Oh, is he anything like
Mun-Mun the Mongoose?

164
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,311
He taught us not to play with cobras.

165
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:42,308
You had to be taught
not to play with cobras?

166
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,555
You had to be taught
not to burn down the forest?

167
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:58,319
If you guys were hungry, why didn't
you order at the restaurant?

168
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:00,157
We did.
You never brought it.

169
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,918
Oh, that's right.

170
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,678
Nachos and a turkey club.

171
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,198
Not even close.

172
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:10,717
Well, l was too busy
standing up for my friend

173
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,512
to worry about your...

175
00:09:14,999 --> 00:09:16,717
You want to say sorry.

176
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,472
So, how are you gonna
tell Raj abut what you did?

177
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,113
What do you mean "how"?
What's the big deal?

178
00:09:26,319 --> 00:09:28,275
You told Lucy he was a pathetic mess.

179
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,232
Then you made her cry and leave.

180
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:32,077
Okay, you guys are overreacting.

181
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,429
Raj is gonna appreciate
howl had his back.

182
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,835
What is wrong with you, Penny?!

183
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,838
You ruined any chancel had
of getting back with Lucy!

184
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:40,471
(CELL PHONE DINGS)

185
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,397
Now she knows I'm a desperate mess

186
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:44,157
instead ofjust being pretty sure!

187
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,079
lt's Lucy.

188
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,759
She wants to meet for coffee.

189
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,996
I love you, Penny!

190
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:59,034
Hey, what are you working on?

191
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,268
I'm thinking about
how one could use the fact

192
00:10:02,479 --> 00:10:06,267
that a rapidly rotating mirror
turns virtual photons into real ones

193
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,869
as a method of observing dark energy.

194
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:10,558
That's a pretty cool idea.

195
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:12,431
Yeah. It's great you're here.

196
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:14,118
I'd love to get
an engineer's opinion.

197
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:15,274
Sure.

198
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,516
This chair is squeaky.

199
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,237
Now, do I fix it or get a new one?

200
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,115
Well, Sheldon,
it took me all morning,

201
00:10:27,319 --> 00:10:29,469
but I found the owner
of the video store.

202
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,194
And I am happy to report
that he died peacefully in his sleep,

203
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,957
drunk at the bottom of a pool.

204
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,273
Anyway, there is no one
to return the DVD to,

205
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,552
so this issue is resolved.

206
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,277
And I'd just like to point out that

207
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,151
even though the sweater
was uncomfortable,

208
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,989
I didn't use it as an excuse
to antagonize everyone around me.

209
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,237
You know, you could reimburse
the video store owner's next of kin.

210
00:10:55,439 --> 00:10:57,669
Or it's resolved!

211
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,591
Hey, that next of kin thing
sounds pretty good.

212
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,958
I believe this is yours.

213
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,553
Can I ask you guys a question?

214
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:15,148
So, I'm seeing Lucy tomorrow night,
and I've never hung out

215
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,316
with someone who broke up with me.
How do you do it?

216
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,317
You can't let her know you're
hurting. The key is confidence.

217
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,510
Why is the key always confidence?

218
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:25,870
How come it's never
love handles and flop sweat?

219
00:11:28,359 --> 00:11:30,714
If this girl hurt you so much, are
you sure you want to see her again?

220
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,434
Well, if! may,
he has so little self-respect

221
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:35,834
and is so desperate
for the smallest crumb of affection,

222
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:38,149
she could literally sleep
with his own father in his own bed

223
00:11:38,359 --> 00:11:40,873
and post the video to YouTube,
and he'd still buy her flowers

224
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:42,876
and ask her to be his bride.

225
00:11:45,999 --> 00:11:46,954
He's right.

226
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,670
But in my defense,
if we could survive that,

227
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,312
we could survive anything.

228
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,110
Well, if you're sure you want
to do this, it's only coffee.

229
00:11:57,319 --> 00:11:59,355
Just relax and see what happens.

230
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:02,109
-Well, can I say she looks nice?
-Sure.

231
00:12:02,319 --> 00:12:03,718
Can ltell herl miss her?

232
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:05,637
Maybe, if she asks.

233
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,432
Can I show her
an oil painting I made of us

234
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,915
surrounded by our children
and grandchildren?

235
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,709
l'd save that for the second date.

236
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,434
Good, good,
'cause no matter how hard I try,

237
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:19,914
I cannot get the twins to look alike.

238
00:12:26,319 --> 00:12:27,229
What are you doing?

239
00:12:27,439 --> 00:12:29,953
Oh, I'm just trying to find
the stupid next of kin

240
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,152
to this stupid video store owner,
so I can return the DVD

241
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,828
and see the look
on Sheldon's stupid face

242
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,952
when he sees that I didn't
let this get to me.

243
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,636
Sheldon's not here.
Why don't you take the sweater off?

244
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:45,114
-There's a principle at stake!
-Which is?

245
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,709
Oh, I don't know.
Who cares? Look at me!

246
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,909
(GASPS)

247
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,951
Oh, my God!
Is that sweater made of bees?

248
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,998
Come on, take it off. I won't tell.

249
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:56,155
No, no, honey, if I take it off,
Sheldon wins.

250
00:12:56,359 --> 00:13:00,910
Sweetie, every night you don't
kill him in his sleep, he wins.

251
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,117
No, it's almost done.

252
00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:07,675
ljust... l have to find
the next of kin, and send 'em the DVD

253
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:09,835
and then just wait for someone
with my complexion to die

254
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,678
so I can get a skin graft.

255
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,074
Smile.

256
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:15,954
What is that? What is that for?

257
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,957
So you can send it to Princeton
and get your money back.

258
00:13:23,319 --> 00:13:25,753
I must say, Sheldon,
you're handling this DVD business

259
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,473
with an impressive amount
of maturity.

260
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,118
I don't know why that surprises you.
I'm a grown man.

261
00:13:31,319 --> 00:13:33,150
As should be evident
by this sport coat

262
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,920
and very real flower in my lapel.

263
00:13:37,239 --> 00:13:40,356
Is there some kind of new coping
mechanism you're employing?

264
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,915
The more interesting question
you should be asking is,

265
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,634
"What does this flower smell like?"

266
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,354
I'm gonna go with sad.

267
00:13:50,319 --> 00:13:52,196
So what's the story
with you and this DVD?

268
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,957
There's nothing to tell.

269
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:55,638
Maybe I purchased a book entitled,

270
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,158
Don't Sweat the Small Stuff

271
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,955
and I followed its wise suggestions,
one of which was:

272
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,071
stop and smell the flowers.

273
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,634
-Seriously?
-Please.

274
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,434
Haha!

275
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,519
-Hi.
-Hello.

276
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:27,550
-Oh, it's so good to see you.
-You, too.

277
00:14:28,359 --> 00:14:29,758
Please, sit.

278
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:32,195
I got you a cappuccino.
I remembered it was your favorite.

279
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,277
I also got crumb cake,

280
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,391
but remembered
it was my favorite, and I ate it.

281
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,959
Anyway, how are you?

282
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,273
I'm pretty good.

283
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,152
Listen, | just wanted to apologize

284
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,396
for breaking up with you
in an e-mail.

285
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,436
And late all the crumb cake.
We both made mistakes.

286
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,029
Okay.

287
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,071
I'm so happy you asked me here,

288
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,190
and I hope we can hang out
again sometime.

289
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,878
You know, as friends,
lovemaking partners, whatever.

290
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,038
Oh...

291
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:04,155
I'm kind of seeing someone.

292
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:07,593
I think I know the answer to this,

293
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,519
but just to be clear,
it's not me, right?

294
00:15:12,439 --> 00:15:13,792
This is all your fault!

295
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,797
lshould've listened to Mun-Mun
because I've been playing

296
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,910
with a cobra and her name is Penny!

297
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,880
Why are you so cruel?
Do you enjoy my pain?

298
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,951
There's a girl at the Cheesecake
Factory I can set you up with.

299
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,599
I love you, Penny!

300
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,673
How is it I can conceptualize
a methodology

301
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:34,756
of examining dark matter
in the universe

302
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,871
but can't figure out how
to fix a novelty squirt flower?

303
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:40,478
I think the real question is,

304
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,478
why do you waste your time
with cheap, childish pranks?

305
00:15:44,239 --> 00:15:45,831
There's probably a deep reason,

306
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,951
which I'd be happy
to discuss with you

307
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,310
over some peanut brittle in a can.

308
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:53,675
Okay, Sheldon, lam out of options!

309
00:15:53,879 --> 00:15:56,712
Video store owner, Nursis Manookian,

310
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,069
has no next of kin!

311
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,114
Well, you seem hot
under the collar...

312
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:02,957
or is that the sweater?

313
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,239
Oh, oh, no, no.
It's because I spent all afternoon

314
00:16:06,439 --> 00:16:08,589
at the Armenian church
where his funeral mass was held.

315
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,472
According to Father Solakian,

316
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,033
no one attended.

317
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,832
Luckily, my trip
wasn't a complete waste.

318
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,189
I lit a candle
and prayed for your death.

319
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,675
But I'm not Armenian,
so it probably won't work!

320
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,478
This is over, right?

321
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,272
Oh, not necessarily.

322
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,277
| suggest you look
for long-lost relatives

323
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,948
either in Armenia or Lebanon.

324
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,473
Listen to me, Sheldon.

325
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,432
lam not going to Lebanon

326
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:39,076
to return
Super Mario Bros. the movie!

327
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,996
Anyway, it might be fun.
You love hummus.

328
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,597
Why isn't this bothering you?

329
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:49,676
lsn't your brain getting itchy?

330
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:52,029
This is on your card.

331
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,196
This could be ruining
your credit score!

332
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,152
Why isn't this making you crazy?

333
00:16:58,999 --> 00:17:00,114
Leonard...

334
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,716
l have something to tell you,

335
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,593
but I want you to promise
not to flip out.

336
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:07,868
What?

337
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,158
Seven years ago,

338
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,113
I found out the DVD was late
and I paid for it.

339
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:23,508
What?

340
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:26,432
l was going to mention it
at the time,

341
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,835
but then I thought, some day,

342
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,428
this might be a teachable moment.

343
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,197
(GASPS)

344
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,670
Ahh!

345
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,638
But l...?! You...?! How...?!

346
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,068
What?!

347
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:06,832
Sheldon, that was diabolical.

348
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,909
I know.

349
00:18:10,439 --> 00:18:11,758
And it wasn't easy.

350
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,434
Do you have any idea what it's like
to wait for years,

351
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,113
and never know if you're going
to finally get satisfaction?

352
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,188
Wow.

353
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,958
You're even prettier than Penny said.

354
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:30,753
I can't believe a girl like you
doesn't have a boyfriend.

355
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:31,914
Well, I don't.

356
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,111
I don't believe you.
You're lying to me!

357
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,519
What?

358
00:18:36,719 --> 00:18:38,949
It's okay. I have no morals,
and I'm desperately lonely.

359
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,116
I'll be the other man if you want
a little something-something

360
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:42,798
on the side.

361
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,513
What is wrong with you?!

362
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,153
What is wrong with you?!

363
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,715
What is wrong with you?!

364
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,470
