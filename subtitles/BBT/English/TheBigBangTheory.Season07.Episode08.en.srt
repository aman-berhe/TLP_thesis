Hey!

00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,868
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

3
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:09,787
Thank you.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,558
What's up, Comic-Con?

5
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:13,228
-(AUD|ENCE CHEERING)
-Whnn!

6
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:15,268
All right!

7
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:17,157
We're going to have fun.
Are you guys ready?

8
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,759
-Yeah.
-All right.

9
00:00:18,919 --> 00:00:20,113
All right. Hey, writers.

10
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:20,950
-Hi.
-Hi.

11
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,156
-Hnw's it going? All right.
-Gnnd.

12
00:00:23,319 --> 00:00:25,310
So, I'm so excited
to be moderating this panel.

13
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,708
We're going to have a lot of fun.

14
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:29,228
I'm going to ask a
few questions, and then

15
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,799
I'll throw to you guys,
and we'll go back and forth.

16
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,672
All right. Don't mess it up.

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,635
All right. Cool.

18
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:37,267
All right.
So, I'd like to know,

19
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,396
where do the story ideas come from?

20
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,873
Well, we often make them up...

21
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,187
(MELISSA CHUCKLING)

22
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,313
...and sometimes, we will
take them from our own lives.

23
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:51,039
One that comes
to mind involved... you.

24
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,872
-Me?
-As Bernadette and Wolowitz.

25
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,032
Do you guys remember the episode
where Wolowitz comes back from space

26
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,591
and Bernadette wants to reconnect
romantically with her husband

27
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,193
but she's really sick?

28
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:04,156
That was my wedding night.

29
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,912
(LAUGHTER)

30
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,397
And lwas really sick. And I held it
together during the wedding,

31
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,870
and then it all started coming
out of me at the end of the night,

32
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:13,949
and l was a mess.

33
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,550
And my wife was saying,
"It's okay, you should go to sleep."

34
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:21,473
And all I could say was, "No,
we have to consummate the marriage."

35
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,789
(GROANS)

36
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,477
So she's a lucky lady.

37
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,477
And I believe the nighty I wore in
that episode

38
00:01:29,559 --> 00:01:31,277
was the one you wore....

39
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,475
You can see the mucus stains.

40
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,595
So, any other stories
come from your lives?

41
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,955
| always wanted a tiara. So....

42
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,669
You would look very good in one.

43
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,354
I think so. A pretty princess
and this is my tiara.

44
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,511
Maria, you-- In the episode
where Sheldon got spanked--

45
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:50,914
Yes, the one where
Amy gets spanked, and

46
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,430
she's trying to get attention from
Sheldon by pretending to be sick,

47
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,995
was from my high school.
That was me.

48
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,519
l was doing a play
with a guy I really liked,

49
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,229
and l was trying to seduce him
backstage by exaggerating my cold.

50
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,708
So I'd be like, "on,
I'm shaking uncontrollably."

51
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,075
And he would tuck me
in with his trench coat.

52
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,190
It was awesome.

53
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,479
How does the writing process work?

54
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,914
Do people go off and
write a script on their own,

55
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:15,513
or does everyone
work on every script?

56
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,595
Since the first season,
we've written as a group.

57
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,311
So, we sit in a room, and a writers'
assistant has the horrible job

58
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:28,989
of sitting at a typewriter,
and writing down everything,

59
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:29,916
and getting it right.

60
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,752
And we start, you know,

61
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,117
"Fade in: Interior Leonard
and Sheldon's apartment.

62
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,474
Sheldon comes in...."

63
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:38,072
We do it as--
We do it together.

64
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,549
Sometimes in a subset
of the whole group.

65
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,312
Usually, it's this group of people.

66
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,790
I don't know how we are not all
so sick of each other at this point.

67
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:46,988
I'm sick of some of you.

68
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:48,911
There's a lot of hugging,
I know that.

69
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,592
-And a lot of tears.
-Yeah.

70
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,916
Mostly after the hugging.

71
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,356
There's a lot of arguing.

72
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,317
One of the best moments of last year

73
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,392
involved me making
Steve very angry...

74
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:06,598
...when he was talking about
the great episode where...

75
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,155
There's a letter
from Howard's father,

76
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,196
and there's a question
as to what's in it.

77
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:15,715
And Steve said, "Well,
maybe there's a way to do it

78
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,269
where we never find out
what's in the letter."

79
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:22,188
And I said, "Oh, you've got to tell
people what's in the letter."

80
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:25,908
And then, Steve said, "Remember
there are children in the room."

81
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,591
He said, "You--
You're a bad person."

82
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,910
"You're really pissing me off
right now with your rules.

83
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,832
Now, I'm going to find
a way to do this episode

84
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,514
where we don't know what
was in the letter."

85
00:03:37,679 --> 00:03:39,397
And I think it's terrific.

86
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,387
What's harder to write,
the science, or the "geek-ery"?

87
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:45,470
We have some help with the science
at the end of the table.

88
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:48,233
Believe it or not, we're all pretty
comfortable with the "geek-ery."

89
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:49,713
(LAUGHTER)

90
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,756
I mean, the science
comes sometimes....

91
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:55,592
We, you know, sometimes we have
ideas from articles we've read,

92
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,832
or sometimes we, you know,
have a vague notion of science,

93
00:03:58,999 --> 00:04:00,830
or sometimes we put brackets
that say, "Science to come,"

94
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,191
and we toss it over
to Dr. Saltzberg here,

95
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,958
for him to fill in some things.

96
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,078
That's right. And it's maybe not
as exciting as a wedding night,

97
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:12,874
or slapping, uh...
but I do read Physics Today.

98
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:15,110
(CHUCKLING)

99
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:17,113
And sometimes we do
our own research,

100
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,396
like, you remember we were looking
for spider facts for something

101
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,591
for the Spider-Man joke.
Like what can....

102
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,477
There was ajoke where
Sheldon was irritated

103
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:24,958
by the Spider-Man theme song.

104
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,236
And he decided there were lots
of things a spider could do

105
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,156
that Spider-Man couldn't.

106
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:30,275
And then we had to try to find
what those facts were.

107
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,118
So we were all Google-ing things.

108
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,395
And I found this
website that was like,

109
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,516
"Amazing true science facts
about spiders."

110
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,591
So I was reading them,
and it's like, you know,

111
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,199
"The tensile strength
of a spider string

112
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:41,833
contains more potential
energy than the atomic bomb."

113
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,389
And, "Spiders live forever."

114
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,676
I mean, they can be killed,
you can kill a spider,

115
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,149
but if you don't kill them,
they will never die.

116
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:51,628
And we were like, "These are
great facts. Write them down."

117
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,071
Are you guys ready
to ask some questions?

118
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:56,150
Should I throw to you guys?

119
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:57,468
Yeah? All right.

120
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:01,432
All right. Cool costume.

121
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:03,555
It's, okay,
Princess Leia in disguise.

122
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,109

124
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,429
MELISSA: What?

125
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:17,954
Yeah, my question is--
Sorry, I am so nervous.

126
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:22,675
The cast, are they
like their characters?

127
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,239
Are we like our characters?

128
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:25,354
What do you guys think?

129
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:28,397
Well, Mayim in real life
is a neuroscientist,

130
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:30,709
and she plays one on the show.

131
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:32,392
I don't know, are you
like your character?

132
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,871
l'm nothing like my character at all.

133
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:39,076
I'm actually a six foot four,
African-American dude

134
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:40,149

I believe-- Kunal, I believe,
is actually lndian.

Okay. Leonard is nice
and fun to hang outwith,

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,709
-and Galecki can be a bit much.
-Galecki is a problem.

139
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:52,790
His need to be liked....

140
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:55,519
We do all get excited when
we get to hang out with Kaley.

141
00:05:58,039 --> 00:05:59,154
Fun to hang outwith.

142
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,758
-Does that answer your--?
-That's not an acceptable answer.

-MEL|SSA: Whoa! Excuse me?
-MAN: Okay.

144
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,917
It's not an acceptable answer.

Really? Dude, who are you?
Reveal yourself.

155
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:49,074
All right.

156
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:56,193
I couldn't stay away.

157
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,311
This is so exciting. All right.

158
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,077
Do we have another question
from the audience?

159
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,193
WOMAN: Since Season One,

160
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,914
we've seen Penny
go from being a ditzy blonde

161
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,229
to being more street smart.

162
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,832
I want to know how that
evolution came to be.

163
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,831
MAN: Well, it kind of mirrored
a change in Bill's personality,

164
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,672
from a ditzy blonde to a....

165
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:21,832
I don't think--

166
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:24,991
You know, I think that we just
got to know Penny better.

167
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,110
You know I think--

168
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:30,192
I think the pilot,
is a little off the series,

169
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,909
but, starting with the first episode
of the series, which is episode two,

170
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,593
I think that's the Penny
that she always was,

171
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,637
but we spent more time with her.

172
00:07:38,799 --> 00:07:42,109
Although, the wardrobe
was a specific request.

173
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:45,988
And that was based on her
getting a smidge of success--

174
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:48,115
I think it was around the time
she got the hemorrhoid--

175
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,759
When she got the
hemorrhoid commercial.

176
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,991
We decided she probably got
some money from that, maybe,

177
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,997
bought some more grown up clothes.

178
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,513
But there's also the thing

179
00:07:56,719 --> 00:07:59,677
and that was based on actors
and actresses that we know,

180
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,319
where once you get--

181
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:03,316
Once you get a little bit
of success, and you realize--

182
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,993
You buy a Boushh costume.

183
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,195
Yeah, that's right.
But that you're....

184
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:11,668
I assume you guys deal with this,

185
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,478
which is the notion that
when you go out in public,

186
00:08:13,679 --> 00:08:14,907
and you can be recognized,

187
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,791
you want to look... not--

188
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,109
You want to look reasonable.

189
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:20,349
-MEL|SSA: | always look disgusting.
-True.

190
00:08:22,239 --> 00:08:23,194
I thought that was great.

191
00:08:23,359 --> 00:08:25,315
l have to say that I love that
the writers wrote Penny

192
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,431
as a talented actress.

193
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,037
And, I think we all kind of expected
to see Penny fail up on that stage.

194
00:08:32,199 --> 00:08:35,555
That would have been a laugh,
but it really made us root

195
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,478
for that character
even more than we already did.

196
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:39,869
I loved that you guys
made that choice.

197
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,594
I mean,
I would ask you and Melissa,

198
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:46,274
I think her career
is moving at a speed

199
00:08:46,439 --> 00:08:49,112
that matches the speed
of my friends who are actors.

200
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,793
-Sure.
-Yeah. So--

201
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,713
It goes kind of slow for a while.

202
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,997
MELISSA: A lot of wine,
a lot of waitressing.

203
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,231
Um...

204
00:08:58,319 --> 00:09:01,117
Let's do one more question,
and then we'll go back to me.

205
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,077
MAN: The actors seem to laugh
a lot at their jokes.

206
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,350
Is there a lot of
improvising on the show?

207
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,430
There is no improvising.

208
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:12,554
What these amazing writers put
in that script, is what we say,

209
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,075
and we get the script the night
before the table read,

210
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,516
and | always say, it's like Christmas
morning whenever I get that script.

211
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:21,751
| get so excited to see
what they put on the page.

212
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,672
But even throughout
the week. I mean--

213
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,274
We do find what you guys find funny.

214
00:09:26,479 --> 00:09:30,154
lt's... They're brilliant at what
they do, and hilarious.

215
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,195
Johnny, do you have...?

216
00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:34,436
Yeah, well sometimes
the writers write on the fly

217
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,273
during live tapings, which is very
difficult to do, obviously.

218
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,994
And so sometimes
the line is very new to us.

219
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:43,716
And then often, it can be
an audience's reaction

220
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,435
that we don't foresee throughout
the week of rehearsal.

221
00:09:47,599 --> 00:09:49,157
Like, they laugh too hard.

222
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:51,231
And we need to make it less funny.

223
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,836
You know, it really kind of governs,
not just the pace of a scene,

224
00:09:54,999 --> 00:09:59,390
but sometimes,
the entire point of a scene,

225
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,237
or the priorities of a scene.

226
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:02,434
And that's a lot of fun.

227
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,358
And then sometimes, we're just
charmed by ourselves.

228
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,190
(LAUGHTER)

229
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,989
Kunal has a particular proclivity
for laughing at his own jokes.

230
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,358
But as an editing style for the show,

231
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,354
I mean, I think one of the things
that's always weird to me in sitcoms,

232
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:20,669
is sometimes, characters
say very funny things

233
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:23,114
that the character knows
is funny,

234
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,475
and the people in the room
don't laugh.

235
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:26,958
-Yeah.
-And that's weird,

236
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:29,274
because usually when people say
something funny, people laugh.

237
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:30,508
So, as an editing style,

238
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:34,831
when characters are reacting with
laughter, which is natural and real,

239
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:38,833
we like to use it because that's what
would happen in the real world.

240
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,508
Kaley laughs a lot.

241
00:10:41,359 --> 00:10:42,997
Yes.

242
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,590
Eric, I hear that you've said
it's a very notice-y room,

243
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,916
that the writers' room
is a very notice-y room.

244
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:50,956
And what does that mean?

245
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,634
Well, yeah, that's a paradox.

246
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,675
Because this is a show that...

247
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:02,317
...celebrates the outsider,

248
00:11:02,599 --> 00:11:08,708
and criticizes the human propensity
to shun or make fun of the outsider.

249
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,477
But, if you do something
unusual in the writers' room,

250
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,631
like, say, trim your nails
with the office scissors,

251
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:17,790
they don't let you forget about it.

252
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,355
So, it is--

253
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,472
It has been compared by some, me,

254
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:26,676
to being examined
by a monster with 20 eyes.

255
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,118
One of the most amazing members
of the Big Bang production team,

256
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,874
is Scott London,
who is our prop master.

257
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,919
And at production meetings,
we say to Scott, things like,

258
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,478
"We'll need killer robots,"

259
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:43,552
or, "We'll need
telematic kissing-machines,"

260
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,672
or, "We need giant Jenga."

261
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:52,357
And, Scott, he'll just go, "About
how big do you see the Jenga?"

262
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:54,067
(MELISSA CHUCKLING)

"Do I need two sets? One locked in
place for a point in the game,

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,913
or do all lose?
How do you want it?"

265
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,678
And then he makes giant Jenga.

266
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,151
The giant Jenga actually
came from Johnny, right?

267
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,995
Yeah, my brother in Chicago, got a
hold of some wood and a table saw,

268
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,559
and next thing we knew,

269
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,712
we were playing massive
Jenga in the backyard.

270
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:19,073
By flashlight.

271
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,471
And when you're the size
of my brother and l,

272
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,358
it's a dangerous game.

273
00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:28,991
-lt's played to the death.
-Pretty much.

274
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,870
You need to be quick, if you're
down there at the lower tiers.

275
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,396
Then he also has to make

276
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,319
all the Chinese meals
that we eat around the table.

277
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,869
And for good or ill,

278
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:43,633
Scott was a chef beforehand.

279
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:46,267
And so, they're absolutely delicious.

280
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,357
-MEL|SSA: So good. So good.
-They're so good.

281
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,437
And we eat much too much
in between takes,

282
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,635
when we really
don't need to be eating.

283
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,791

the show. Is that intentional?

284
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,353
Do you intentionally write....?

00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,431
There's a lot of eating

doing at the beginning of the scene?"

288
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:03,037
And then we're sitting and eating.

289
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,474
"Well, maybe they're eating."
Okay....

290
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,159
They're very brainy characters,

so in order to make them relatable,

we want those things that

you're walking through the halls,

307
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:49,867
do the geologists stop you and
ask you what the heck is going on?

308
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,630
I've had to stay out
of the Geology building.

309
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,118
They actually will throw rocks
at you, is my understanding.

310
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:00,190
It's the most dangerous
science to piss off.

311
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,193
That's right. "Do you know
what this is? This is feldspar!"

312
00:14:05,359 --> 00:14:06,348
"This is quartz!"

313
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,199

not that great at throwing.

and then meet that

334
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,388

00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:23,198
And-- So, it's really exciting
and insightful when you get

340
00:15:23,319 --> 00:15:26,629
to meet a character
that the writers have written

341
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,554
who gives you even more backstory,
and understanding of a character

342
00:15:30,719 --> 00:15:32,914
that you've been
playing for six year, so,

343
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,514
I'm looking forward to meeting
Leonard's father,

344
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,352
I'm looking forward to meeting,

345
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,798
spending more time with his--
And we always talked about

346
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,269
Sheldon and Leonard,
having the mother

347
00:15:44,439 --> 00:15:46,555
that the other wanted and needed,

348
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,236
and really feeling that envy
between the two characters.

349
00:15:51,359 --> 00:15:54,590
So-- And they're both incredible
actresses obviously,

350
00:15:54,719 --> 00:15:57,950
so the more family, as far as
I'm concerned, the better.

351
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,633
It just takes a story.

352
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,633
It's a question that we get a lot.

353
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,836
And the answer is that,

354
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,837
you can't say,
"We're going to do an episode

355
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:10,708
where we meet one
of Leonard's siblings."

356
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:14,554
You have to have a-- There has to
be a story going on with Leonard

357
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,474
where meeting one of his siblings
is what you want in the story.

358
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,427
It all-- All of these things
start with story.

359
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,676
You have to have-- Leonard has
to be going through something,

360
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:27,911
or the arrival of a sibling
might change something.

361
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,799
MAN: What about your
personal experience

362
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,512
made you want to write for this show?

363
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:35,833
Well, I remember when lwas applying
for thisjob, I met with Bill.

364
00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:37,796
And ljust tried to do a laundry list

365
00:16:37,999 --> 00:16:42,038
of all the nerdy things
I'd ever done and that succeeded.

366
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:46,112
And one of them was, when l was in
college, I went to a costume party,

367
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,191
and l dressed up
as The Doppler effect.

368
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:49,475
And....

369
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,755
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

370
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,430
And, since it was college, I got
increasingly drunk during the night,

371
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,992
and ran around going:

372
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,678
(MAKES DOPPLER EFFECT
HORN SOUND)

373
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,236
And I think it was some time after
that story that Bill said,

374
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,276
"You have the job."

375
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,995
And also, then I was like,
"This is the best job in the world."

376
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:11,677
Maria had a pretty good story when we
met with her for working on the--

377
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,955
Yeah, right before
my interview for this job,

378
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,599
my husband and l were playing
a lot of World of Warcraft

379
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,670
because I didn't have ajob.

380
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,031
And it was our anniversary,
and we didn't have any money,

381
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:20,911
because I didn't have ajob.

382
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:24,355
And I said, "Why don't we give
ourselves in-game presents?"

383
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,035
And I really wanted a Phantom Blade,
because my rogue had just hit 30,

384
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:29,109
or whatever that is.

385
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,273
And I got him a Darkmoon Faire
Amulet, I got him a Lunacy Deck.

386
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,748
And he got me real-life chocolates.

387
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,554
And l was like,
"This is not what we talked about."

388
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:41,428
(LAUGHTER)

389
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,715
You have the saddest story.

390
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,709
Didn't you have
Dungeons 8. Dragons solo set?

391
00:17:50,879 --> 00:17:53,154
Some of us played Dungeons 8.
Dragons when we were kids a lot.

392
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,191
-But if you were me--
-Nothing geeky about that.

393
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,397
Well, if you had no friends,

394
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:00,551
they made something called
Dungeons 8. Dragons solo modules,

395
00:18:00,719 --> 00:18:02,311
which you could play by yourself.

396
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,596
And it was like,
"Choose your own ending."

397
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,479
And poor little lonely, fat Steve
would be there rolling his dice,

398
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,790
in his room with his solo module.

399
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,673
But now | get to work
on the show, so it all worked out.

400
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,719
I still have no friends.

401
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,719
Who was the most hardcore
gamer out of all of you?

402
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,437
-Maria.
-Probably Maria.

403
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,588
-Maria.

404
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,715
-Nice.
-Yeah.

405
00:18:21,879 --> 00:18:23,676
You heard her story already, right?

406
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,876
-Do you have to ask that question?
-Pretty hardcore.

407
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,714
She'll take whatever is in the
environment, and play a game with it,

408
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,872
whether it's a stick
or a couple of rocks.

409
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,229
She'll start playing with them.

410
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,550
-She'll spin a hoop down the street--
-Hoops.

411
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:37,994
MELISSA: That is the only
correct answer. Moving on.

412
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:41,749
Who wrote out the Roommate
and Relationship Agreements?

413
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,558
Because I could really
use one of those.

414
00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:46,835
We kind if pieced it together
as we've gone along.

415
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,876
lt's ever growing, isn't it?

416
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,632
Yeah, it's a living document.

417
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:55,391
It's a vast document, that seems to
have what you need for the story.

418
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,277
Oh look, it does have that!

419
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:00,838
I did a page of it for
Entertainment—

420
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:01,630
Right.

421
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:05,878
Entertainment Weekly
published a page that I did--

422
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,510
And I think you could see
a page of it on the screen

423
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,314
in the "Shelbot" episode.

424
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,948
-Yeah.
-When he flashes it to Leonard.

425
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:16,275
There's a prop that you guys have.

426
00:19:16,439 --> 00:19:17,713
Does it have anything in it?

427
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,509
The binder? Oh, yeah. Again,
Scott London, the prop master.

428
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:22,748
Yeah, it's very, very detailed.

429
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:26,395
I've made it through a page
and a half at this point.

430
00:19:27,639 --> 00:19:29,391
Are there any inside jokes
between the writers,

431
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:31,197
that make it into episodes?

432
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,394
I'm sure there are.

433
00:19:34,199 --> 00:19:36,235
That's a very reasonable question.

434
00:19:36,719 --> 00:19:38,471
-Well, Bazinga was an inside joke.
-If we think of any--

435
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,995
-Bazinga was a--
-Yeah, the grapefruit.

436
00:19:41,199 --> 00:19:43,076
Bazinga was a thing
that came from the room

437
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:46,908
from Steven Engel,
who was a writer earlier on.

438
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:51,313
Names of people, often,
names of characters are....

439
00:19:51,479 --> 00:19:54,755
Howard Wolowitz was the name of my
partner in the computer business

440
00:19:54,919 --> 00:19:55,988
when l was a programmer.

441
00:19:57,359 --> 00:19:58,712
And so, some of those things--

442
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,677
There was a time when
Wolowitz was talking about

443
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,114
bullies that had
bullied him in high school.

444
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:04,110
And we were using
bullies from our past.

445
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:05,428
-And lthink--
-This is true.

446
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:07,078
I think Jim Reynolds
might have actually,

447
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,992
he put his bully's name in,
and then asked to have it removed,

448
00:20:09,199 --> 00:20:11,076
-because he was afraid.
-The next day.

449
00:20:11,439 --> 00:20:12,667
(LAUGHTER)

450
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:13,829
That's a good bully.

451
00:20:13,999 --> 00:20:15,717
That's a bully who
was good at his job.

452
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,233
-l'm so desperate--
-To terrify this guy.

453
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,391
I'm so desperate to tell
you guys the name right now,

454
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:21,157
just to watch Jim sweat.

455
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:22,832
Don't do it.
He was scary.

456
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:25,755
MAN: Considering how chaotic
Comic-Con is,

457
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,548
how does Sheldon handle that,
with all of his weird idiosyncrasies?

458
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:30,270
That's a really good question.

459
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,879
I mean, lthink we haven't
talked about that.

460
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,709
But I've got to believe that Sheldon
would have a very specific plan,

461
00:20:35,879 --> 00:20:36,675
where he would prepare--

462
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:38,591
He would know the experience
he's going into,

463
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,027
and he would have coping
mechanisms

464
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:43,316
that he would have designed
for lines and things like that.

465
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,471
lt's howl handle Comic-Con.

466
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,995
I had very specific coping
mechanisms.

467
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:52,868
I bet we're not the people to ask
in this room, that question.

468
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,871
I bet some of you
know the answer to that.

469
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,839
But I think Sheldon,

470
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,438
difficult situations,
Sheldon does well

471
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,713
if he knows what the situation
will be, and...

472
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,634
...develops a coping strategy,
I think.

473
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:05,948
I mean it's kind of a dull answer,

474
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,717
but I think that's
how he would do it.

475
00:21:07,879 --> 00:21:08,994
I think he'd hate "cutsies."

476
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,351
-Oh, people who cut the line? Oh no.
-Sheldon wouldn't like that.

477
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:17,349
Sheldon would probably believe
that there is a citizen's arrest...

478
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:18,515
...possible.

479
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,716
So, he would work
the logic this way,

480
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:24,388
saying a line creates
an implied contract.

481
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,274
He also would find it really weird
that his face is on those giant bags.

482
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,112
David, I have a question for you.

483
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:37,713
How often do you change
the whiteboard?

484
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,198
-Oh, they change every time.
-They change--

485
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,669
They often are related to what

486
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:47,797
the characters are
talking about that week.

487
00:21:47,959 --> 00:21:51,952
And there's also some
inside jokes for the scientists.

488
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:55,988
Didn't you have your
students there one week,

489
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,992
and didn't you put up the answers
to the test they had just taken?

490
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:00,512
That's right.

491
00:22:03,199 --> 00:22:06,236
It took them surprisingly
long to figure it out,

492
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,118
which might explain how they did.

493
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,709
But, it's a nice way
to goose the ratings,

494
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,671
by making sure they have
to watch the show.

495
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,353
So, I think that's good.

496
00:22:15,799 --> 00:22:17,630
But sometimes,
they've been very cool things.

497
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,469
They've been... like when they
were talking about time travel once,

498
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,837
-there were time travel things.
-Sure. Sure.

499
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,632
-So if you can--
-The solution to time travel,

500
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,391
is always on the board
in the Big Bang Theory.

501
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:29,508
So if anyone wants to try it--

502
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,834
Well, actually, it's probably the one

503
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,428
behind the DNA molecule
you can't read.

504
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,275
WOMAN: Who's idea was Amy's tiara?

505
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,351
I think we were going
through the story,

506
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:40,669
and it was Chuck's idea
to give her the tiara,

507
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,791
and lthink I kind of
vomited out the whole,

508
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:44,915
"Oh, it's a tiara. I'm a pretty
princess, and this is my tiara."

509
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:46,398
So....

510
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,552
Any time there's something
that's very, very female

511
00:22:50,719 --> 00:22:54,598
about being satisfied by something
in the world, that's from Steve.

512
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:01,478
-That's kind of who we lean to.
-You're welcome, guys.

513
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,834
There are two women on the writing
staff, but then there's Steve.

514
00:23:05,999 --> 00:23:08,752
You were in the pageant world
for a while, weren't you Steve?

515
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:09,954
-l was.
-Oh, that was you.

516
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,956
I thought Steve, was....

517
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:13,347
Life is a pageant.

518
00:23:14,879 --> 00:23:15,709
Very true.

519
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,592
Which character ended up
getting the tenure position?

520
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,432
-I don't think we know who yet.
-Yeah.

521
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:22,555
But at some point, it will happen.

522
00:23:22,719 --> 00:23:24,516
Some, or none?

523
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,119
Will, or won't?

524
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,914
Get, or not get tenure?

525
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,310
Could you guys give us a tease of
what's to come in season seven?

526
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:35,989
Johnny?

527
00:23:36,439 --> 00:23:37,394
(AUDIENCE WHOOPING)

528
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:39,709
I know nothing, and you know it.

529
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,752
-We will see Leonard on the ship.
-Oh, we will?

530
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:44,113
-Yeah, we will.
-Fantastic.

531
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:45,507
Will I have a parrot?

532
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:49,398
-Perhaps.
-We can't give away everything.

533
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,193
Now that Koothrappali can speak
to women without alcohol,

534
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,588
we'll be poking at that a little bit.

535
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,517
-MEL|SSA: Nice, nice.
-Anything else?

536
00:23:56,679 --> 00:23:58,351
-People will have emotions.
-I think Mayim,

537
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,671
Bernadette and Amy may take
their first trip away together,

538
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:02,954
without Penny along.

539
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:03,950
So, that could happen.

540
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,838
Wisecracks will be made.

541
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,394
Do you think Sheldon
and Amy will ever... (BLEEP)

542
00:24:13,999 --> 00:24:16,718
In other words, "doing the nasty"?

543
00:24:16,879 --> 00:24:18,028
Could you be more explicit?

544
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,159
Eric, when a man and a woman....

545
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,436
I think I'll use Sheldon words,
and say,

546
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,596
it is a possibility.

547
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,433
Possibility? All right.

548
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,517
Once you erotically
massage someone's nose,

549
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:34,596
it is a slippery slope.

550
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,154
I think we all know
what happens after that.

551
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,909
I believe Amy will
continue to try to get her way.

552
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:45,309
I'm pretty confident in saying that.

553
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,113
I don't know.

554
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:49,795
They're kind of a, sort of an

555
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,549
irresistible force, immovable object
thing to write.

556
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:59,397
It always baffles me, how much
Amy has gotten Sheldon to move.

557
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,635
-Right.
-Yeah.

558
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,236
That's always amazing.

559
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,675
But it's a very interesting
thing in the writers' room,

560
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:07,234
because with Sheldon,

561
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:10,112
you have a character who
comes from a place of "no."

562
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:12,594
"No, I'm not going to change at all."

563
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:15,227
And, it's a lot of interesting
work in the room,

564
00:25:15,439 --> 00:25:17,873
for somebody to say,
"What if Amy did this?"

565
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,396
And at some point somebody will say
something, and then you go,

566
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:24,710
"Okay, yeah. He'd
give in at that point." Right?

567
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,318
I also kind of think part of the
charm of their relationship is

568
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,198
its, sort of, glacial pace.

569
00:25:30,359 --> 00:25:34,318
I think there's such a sweetness
to that, that I don't know,

570
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,678
I think one of the virtues is
how slowly we move it forward.

571
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,719
It also gives us a way
the show can last a lot longer.

572
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,359
A lot of us have kids
who need to go to college.

573
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:47,872
Great.

574
00:25:48,879 --> 00:25:52,110
ldeally, when you watch the show,
you should pretend it's real

575
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,753
to enjoy it, so,

576
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,717
if you are like, "I know
what's going to happen

577
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:56,829
because I went to Comic-Con,

578
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,560
and people wrote it,"
I think you'd enjoy the show less.

579
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,278
I don't know.
This is my theory.

580
00:26:03,999 --> 00:26:06,308
Well, doesn't that negate
the concept of this panel?

581
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,390
A little.

582
00:26:11,879 --> 00:26:15,394
l'm skeptical of the whole Comic-Con
thing, because I feel like....

583
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:16,395
(CHUCKLING)

584
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:19,717
When I enjoyed The Wizard of Oz,

585
00:26:19,879 --> 00:26:21,870
l was a big Wizard of Oz
fan as a kid,

586
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,600
I kind of related to the
Cowardly Lion as a real guy.

587
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,115
And if I was going on some website,

588
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,428
and there's like,
L. Frank Baum saying,

589
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,750
"I think in the next one, I'm going
to do this, and this, and this,"

590
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,269
it would be harder for me
to relate to the Cowardly Lion

591
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,078
as an imaginative reality.

592
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,992
But didn't you go
to L. Frank Baum Conventions?

593
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,195
Oh, yeah.

594
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,112
l dressed as Tick Tock one year.

595
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,430
It was cool. It was a cool scene.

596
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:49,350
I can't stress enough

597
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,314
how much you just all entered
the Big Bang writers' room.

598
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:56,634
That's what it's like.

599
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:01,509
That is easily 30 percent of the day.

600
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:06,149
You guys, thank you so much for
your help moderating this panel.

602
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,229
Thank you.

603
00:27:09,999 --> 00:27:11,193
GALECKI: Can ljust--
I know we're running late.

604
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,157
But let me take a second to say that,

605
00:27:13,319 --> 00:27:16,470
you guys are... I know everyone says
they have the best fans in the world,

606
00:27:16,639 --> 00:27:17,788
and they're misleading people,

607
00:27:17,999 --> 00:27:20,638
because this show has
the best fans in the world.

608
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,349
And the fact that we all gather here

609
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:29,679
every July, just before we go back
into full-swing production in August,

610
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,549
you guys give us the shot in the arm,
all of us, that is like no other,

611
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,789
to start every new season.

612
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,598
So, thank you, from
the bottom of our hearts.

613
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:38,556
-Thank you so very much.
-Thank you guys.
