1
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:04,988
The math is all there.

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,952
-|t's not real.
-Yes, it is.

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,072
Lack.
It is scientifically impossible

4
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:12,031
for a person to tip a cow.

5
00:00:13,319 --> 00:00:14,672
Even you, with your stocky build

6
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:16,437
and lumberjack shoulders,
you couldn't do it.

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,270
lt's horrible. Why would you push
a cow over? They're sacred.

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,469
Oh, stop it.

9
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:23,397
I've seen you eat,
like, a million hamburgers.

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,114
Hey, an animal can be both
sacred and delicious.

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:28,917
Look, I'm telling you
I've done it, okay?

12
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,599
I clearly remember
the cow standing up

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,028
and then the cow on its side.

14
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,912
Were you drunk?

15
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,317
l was 16 in Nebraska.
What do you think?

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,114
I think you're the one who fell over.

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,029
That would explain why the sky
was also on its side.

18
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,557
-Hey.
-Howard.

19
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,034
Cow tipping: real or not?

20
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,309
I'm going to say... not.

21
00:00:50,519 --> 00:00:52,316
That'sjust based on me
trying to roll

22
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,511
my mom over
when she's snoring.

23
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,439
Speaking of that big side of beef,

24
00:00:58,639 --> 00:01:01,756
she's invited all of you
to Thanksgiving at her house.

25
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,355
Mmm.

26
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,272
You know, I've been told
that a bald refusal

27
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,516
of an invitation is rude
and one must instead

28
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:10,277
offer up a polite excuse, so...

29
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,629
I'd love to go, but, unfortunately,

30
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,592
that sounds awful.

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,672
Come on, it'll be fun.

32
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,949
We were actually
going to do it here.

33
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:22,638
Please?
Bernadette's bringing her dad,

34
00:01:22,839 --> 00:01:23,715
because her mom's out of town,

35
00:01:23,919 --> 00:01:25,750
and I never have anything
to say to that guy.

36
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,030
Since you put it that way,
I'd love to go,

37
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,832
but that sounds even more awful.

38
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,068
lt'd actually be nice to not hear

39
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,793
Sheldon complain
about my cooking all day.

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,115
SHELDON: Excuse me,

41
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,880
but every year
you prepare a terrible meal

42
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,910
and every year | criticize it.

43
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,315
Do our traditions
mean nothing to you?

44
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:45,758
-I want to go.
-Yeah, me, too.

45
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,075
-l'm in.
-Sheldon.

46
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,430
(GROANS) Fine, I'll go.

47
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,756
But if her food is delicious,
Thanksgiving is ruined,

48
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,029
and it's on you.

49
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,951
J“ (THEME SONG PLAYS) J“

50
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,789
Do we really have to go
to Mrs. Wolowitz's house?

51
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:23,428
We do.

52
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:26,153
And I expect you
to be on your best behavior.

53
00:02:26,359 --> 00:02:29,431
Now I know how the
African slaves felt.

54
00:02:30,999 --> 00:02:32,318
Being dragged from their homes

55
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:35,556
to labor under the
yoke of the white man.

56
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,593
Are you honestly comparing
Thanksgiving dinner

57
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:41,267
at Wolowitz's mom's with
one of the greatest tragedies

58
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,072
in the history of mankind?

59
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,919
Yes.

60
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,832
Sheldon, you can have
a nice Thanksgiving anywhere.

61
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,234
I spent one in Vegas.

62
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,190
You did?

63
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,118
Yeah, back when l was dating Zack.

64
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,673
It was actually more fun
than lthought.

65
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,110
We gambled, we went to one
of those cheesy wedding chapels,

66
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,673
we had a really good
turkey dinner.

67
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,235
Which was surprising,
since we were at a strip club.

68
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,514
Wait, you went to a chapel?

69
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:04,834
-Yeah.
-Why?

70
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,793
We had one of those
silly fake weddings.

71
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,429
Penny...

72
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:14,550
you know those are real, right?

73
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,079
No, they're not.

74
00:03:17,559 --> 00:03:19,197
Yeah, they are.

75
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,194
No, they're not.

76
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:23,275
Yeah, they are.

77
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,799
-He's right.
-They' re real.

78
00:03:26,279 --> 00:03:29,191
But it... didn't seem real.

79
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:31,274
Let me ask you a question.

80
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,996
At any point,
was Las Vegas on its side?

81
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,596
-Hi, Dad.
-Hi, honey. Mm.

82
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,352
Oh, you brought beer
for everybody.

83
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,869
Okay.
Yeah, it's for everybody.

84
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,269
l reallyjust wanted to have
a nice, quiet day at home

85
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,549
and watch the game.

86
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,910
You can have a quiet day
and watch the game here.

87
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,430
MOTHER: Howard,
the medicine's not working!

88
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,237
HOWARD: You just took it.

89
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:06,794
At least let it
reach your ﬁrst stomach!

90
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,198
Hey, Mike.

91
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:13,354
Let me help you out, there.

92
00:04:13,559 --> 00:04:15,390
Thanks.
What's wrong with your mom?

93
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,715
Oh, her gout's flaring up.

94
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:19,911
Turns out an apple pie a day
does not keep the doctor away.

95
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,993
MOTHER: How can
one little toe hurt so bad?

96
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,833
Maybe because that little piggy
is being crushed by the barn!

97
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:32,396
She should quiet down soon.

98
00:04:32,599 --> 00:04:35,432
I gave her enough pain meds
to choke a... well, her.

99
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:39,597
I guess we're going to
have to do all the cooking.

100
00:04:39,799 --> 00:04:40,709
l have a better idea.

101
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,989
If you think you're
going to make me

102
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,393
do all this by myself,
you're crazy.

103
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:45,157
l was going to make Raj
do it all by himself.

104
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:46,712
Oh, well, that's a great idea.

105
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:51,396
No traffic, we're sailing.

106
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:54,397
Yes. Like we're on a ship.

107
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,954
Coming from Africa to America.

108
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:02,554
Sheldon, that's
completely inappropriate.

109
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:05,478
You can't keep comparing
yourself to a slave.

110
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,038
Yes, Miss Amy.

111
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,671
I can't believe you're
married to that idiot.

112
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,075
Would you stop?
We just did it as a goof.

113
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,554
Well, a goof or not,
you're actually married.

114
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:18,272
You need to get
this taken care of.

115
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,629
lwill. Why are you
making this such a big deal?

116
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,717
Oh! I have a reason.

117
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:25,479
It could be because
you said yes to marrying Zack,

118
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,079
but every time
Leonard's proposed,

119
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,679
he's gotten a resounding no.

120
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,472
That's just off the top of my head.

121
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,238
So how do | undo this?

122
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,668
I'm hoping you can
get an annulment,

123
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,153
so it's just like
it never happened.

124
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:39,792
Great, well, what do l have to do?

125
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,399
It says here
you can get an annulment

126
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:43,112
if any of the following
conditions are met.

127
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:45,037
"Were you unable
to consummate the marriage?"

128
00:05:45,239 --> 00:05:46,797
(LAUGHS)
Penny? Next.

129
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:51,234
"Is there any evidence
of fraud, bigamy,

130
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,759
want of understanding?"

131
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,756
'Want of understanding?‘

132
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,756
What does that even mean?

133
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,552
Ding, ding, ding.
We have a winner.

134
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,274
Thanks for saving the day.

135
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:01,355
No problem.

136
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,470
It wouldn't be Thanksgiving

137
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,672
without an Indian
providing the food.

138
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:09,349
Now, where does your mom
keep the Crisco?

139
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,436
I don't know.

140
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,358
Probably in awad in her cheek.

141
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:16,467
I'll help Raj in here.
Why don't you go keep my dad company?

142
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:18,829
Oh, he doesn't want me in there.
I'm the creepy little guy

143
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,190
who has sex with his daughter.

144
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,470
-Don't be silly, he loves you.
-Does he?

145
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:27,909
-Okay, he cares about you a lot.
-Really?

146
00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:31,031
I do crap for you all the time.
Get out there.

147
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,517
So your wife's in Arizona
with the grandkids?

148
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:40,789
Uh-huh.

149
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,875
You know, my mom's been to Arizona.

150
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,468
She rode one of those mules
down in the Grand Canyon.

151
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:51,193
Long story short,
they had to shoot it.

152
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,397
Because she's so fat.

153
00:07:00,359 --> 00:07:01,553
(DOORBELL RINGS)

154
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,069
I'll get the door
while you finish laughing.

155
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:09,474
-Hey, guys.
-Happy Thanksgiving.

156
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,998
It smells wonderful.

157
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,156
Is anyone slaving away
in the kitchen?

158
00:07:13,359 --> 00:07:14,712
-Because I, too, know--
-Sheldon.

159
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,517
Here. Thank you for having us.

160
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,516
What's with you?

161
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:20,674
She's mad at me

162
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,916
because she just found out
she's married to Zack.

163
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,870
Really?

164
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,798
That dumb-ass you used to date?

165
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,275
That's hysterical.

166
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,794
I can't believe I felt bad
for opening this in the car.

167
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:38,389
You need any help?

168
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,830
Yeah, can you reach
that gravy boat up there?

169
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,274
-U h, su re.
-G reat.

170
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:43,628
That makes one of you.

171
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,995
Okay we have a lot to do
and not much time to do it.

172
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,475
Bernadette, you're on corn,
gravy and yarn detail.

173
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:52,828
Amy, you're on rolls, cranberries

174
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,235
and making sure Bernadette stays
away from the marshmallows.

175
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,158
That's right, I see you.

176
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,034
Okay if you have
any questions,

177
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:02,916
I'll be over here
basting my ass off.

178
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:04,438
Focus is key.

179
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,439
Did you guys know Penny
married Zack three years ago?

180
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:09,311
-What?
-Wha...?

181
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,867
You ever play football?

182
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,432
A little in college.

183
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,516
-You?
-No.

184
00:08:19,719 --> 00:08:22,233
But I did get tackled
in the hallway once.

185
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,759
The whole school cheered.

186
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:30,474
I found the, court papers

187
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,874
that you and Zack
need to fill out.

188
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:33,558
-I'II print them when we get home.
-Fine.

189
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:35,750
And we can just put this
whole thing behind us.

190
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:36,675
Are you done?

191
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:38,437
-What?
-Look, I get it, I screwed up.

192
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:40,157
Is this all we're going to talk
about the rest of the day?

193
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,229
Why are you mad at me?

194
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:42,633
You're the one that
did the stupid thing.

195
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,439
-I'm just trying to fix it.
-(GROANS) I need some air.

196
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,233
Well... Penny.

197
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:49,031
Now, I don't know the
first thing about women,

198
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,958
but I would not follow her.

199
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,956
Listen to Stretch.

200
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,869
How am I the bad guy?

201
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,514
She's the one who married
someone else. I'm the victim.

202
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:08,597
Sounds like Zack's the victim.
You're sleeping with his wife.

203
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:13,997
I've kept my marriage
together for 35 years.

204
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:15,427
Can Iweigh in here?

205
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:16,515
Sure.

206
00:09:16,719 --> 00:09:18,630
I'm trying to watch the game.
Shut up.

207
00:09:20,719 --> 00:09:21,834
(GROANS)

208
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:24,274
How do you not make
a first down there?

209
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,959
They passed against
a nickel defense.

210
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,832
They should have run it off-tackle.

211
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,118
How the hell
do you know that?

212
00:09:32,319 --> 00:09:33,672
My father loved football.

213
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:35,358
He always made me watch it

214
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,039
before I was allowed
to do my homework.

215
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,798
(DOOR OPENS)
PENNY: Well...

216
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,439
You'll be happy to know
I just spoke to Zack

217
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:42,038
and he's willing to
sign the court papers.

218
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,309
He's on his way here now.

219
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,033
-Wait, you invited him here?
-Yeah.

220
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,797
I'm getting ready
to weigh in again.

221
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:49,034
Come on.

222
00:09:50,479 --> 00:09:52,947
What do you think
they ought to do now?

223
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,151
I would throw a quick slant
to a wide-out,

224
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,510
given that the defense
is showing blitz.

225
00:09:57,719 --> 00:10:00,677
Oh, I love a good blitz,
especially with sour cream.

226
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:04,669
Get it?

227
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:07,109
Because it sounds like "blintz."

228
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:10,269
MOTHER: Did someone say blintz?

229
00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:12,315
I just don't understand

230
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,748
why you invited him here today.

231
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,114
Because you wouldn't
shut up about it.

232
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,394
When I called him,
he had nothing to do,

233
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:17,315
so I just thought it would--

234
00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:18,952
Hey, guys, I'm trying
to cook in here.

235
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,229
Oh, sorry.
We'll keep it down.

236
00:10:20,439 --> 00:10:22,191
No, no, speak up.

237
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,269
I'm about to use the blender,

238
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,152
and I don't want to miss anything.

239
00:10:26,999 --> 00:10:28,796
Well, you might have
to cook for one more

240
00:10:28,999 --> 00:10:29,954
because she invited Zack.

241
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:31,877
-AMY: What?
-BERNADETTE: What?

242
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:34,552
MV. "IV-

243
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:38,149
The plot, like my gravy, thickens.

244
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,356
I don't care for your
mother's bathroom.

245
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,437
There's not an angle
to do one's business

246
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:49,153
without a clown figurine
staring at you.

247
00:10:50,479 --> 00:10:54,677
-That's why I sit.
-Yeah, that's why.

248
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:59,076
You remember
the Thanksgiving game

249
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,998
when it snowed in Dallas?

250
00:11:01,199 --> 00:11:04,475
Nineteen-ninety three. Leon Lett blew
the game in the final seconds

251
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,352
and the Dolphins
emerged victorious.

252
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,233
Then I finally got to do
my calculus.

253
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:12,556
I was so pissed,
I wanted to shoot my TV.

254
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:14,431
So was my dad.

255
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:15,628
And then he did.

256
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,352
-Anyone need a beer?
-Yeah.

257
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,879
Thank God.

258
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,478
So, does your dad
still live in Texas?

259
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,114
No.
He died when I was 14.

260
00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:30,037
I'm sorry to hear that.

261
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,356
So was the man who owned
the local liquor store.

262
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,876
He cried and cried.

263
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,793
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

264
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,234
So, if your dad died
when you were 14,

265
00:11:43,439 --> 00:11:46,033
you were never old enough
to have a beer with the man.

266
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,390
No, sir.

267
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,319
He did try to give me one
for my high school graduation,

268
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:52,589
but I was 11 and my mom said, no.

269
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,432
Well, you're having one with me.

270
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,470
All right.

271
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,238
To your dad.

272
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:16,155
I never had a beer
with my dad, either.

273
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,636
Do you mind?
We're having a moment here.

274
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,711
I can't believe Penny's
married to Zack.

275
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,318
I wonder what she saw in that guy.

276
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,748
I don't know.

277
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,678
He's sweet, he's tall, handsome.

278
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:38,312
Broad shoulders, good hair.

279
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,277
Hmm, wonder what she
sees in Leonard.

280
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,354
How's it going out there?

281
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,757
Sheldon and your dad are bonding
and completely ignoring me.

282
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,957
I know how you feel.

283
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,277
Sheldon ignored me for a week
when he got that Roomba vacuum.

284
00:12:56,199 --> 00:12:58,190
I kick it when he's not looking.

285
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,310
What are they doing?

286
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:03,948
They're drinking beer
and watching football.

287
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,673
So why don't you do that
with them?

288
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,069
-They don't want me.
-What do you mean?

289
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,711
Well, Sheldon started talking
about how his dad isn't alive anymore,

290
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,148
and they were toasting,
and I tried to tell them

291
00:13:13,319 --> 00:13:14,911
about how sad I was
when my dad abandoned--

292
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,189
(DOORBELL RINGS)
Zack's here!

293
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:18,870
Stir the gravy.

294
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:23,276
Sorry. I really want
to hear how sad you are.

295
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,357
I'll be back in, like, five, ten minutes.

296
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,911
Sorry she made you come
over here on a holiday.

297
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,917
It's all right.
I didn't have anything going on.

298
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,439
Plus, Penny told me we're married,

299
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:38,028
and Thanksgiving's a time
to be with family.

300
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:39,954
Yeah, okay great.

301
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,870
Can we just get this over with?

302
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:44,116
Yeah, you guys
have to sign here and here.

303
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:45,877
On Monday,
we'll file for the annulment,

304
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,478
and this "marriage" will be over.

305
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,635
Okay.

306
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,319
I don't know if I want to sign it.

307
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,118
ALL: Ooh!

308
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,509
Why won't you sign it?

309
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,792
Ijust think splitting up
can be rough on kids.

310
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,149
We don't have any kids.

311
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,713
Are you sure?
Because you didn't know

312
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,558
we were married
until this morning.

313
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:08,987
Okay, look, Zack, come on.

314
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,076
You know neither of us
thought this was real.

315
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,236
I mean, we were married
by an Elvis impersonator.

316
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,674
Of course it was an impersonator.

317
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,400
We could never afford
a real Elvis.

318
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,550
You married him instead of me?

319
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:24,272
Good call.

320
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,799
Sign the papers.

321
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:27,034
Hang on.
You know what?

322
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,832
You have been ajerk
about this all day.

323
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,268
You always do this!
Whenever I mess up,

324
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,198
you're right there to make me
feel even worse about it.

325
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,229
That is not true.

326
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:34,349
We could've waited till Monday,

327
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,834
signed the papers,
this all would have been over.

328
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:37,358
You're the one who
invited him here.

329
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,595
There you go again.
Just another mistake

330
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,874
you're throwing in my face.

331
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,717
Not cool, bro.

332
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,674
I'm starting to think

333
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:47,234
you're not the kind of guy
I want dating my wife.

334
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,350
Yeah, well, she's not going to
be your wife for long.

335
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,079
Oh, no.
Are you dying?

336
00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:57,632
I'm about to.
Sign the paper.

337
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,669
Know what they say:
"Happy wife, happy life."

338
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,914
Let's eat.

339
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,350
(BELCHING) Two, three,
eight, four, six.

340
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:18,990
That's all I can do
without throwing up.

341
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:21,632
That is not what I expected

342
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,637
when you said you
were going to burp "pi."

343
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,400
MOTHER: Did somebody say pie?

344
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:30,752
I don't know what's scarier:

345
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,187
the bathroom clowns,

346
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,038
or the woman
that put them there.

347
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,549
All I know is you can
only fit one of her in a car.

348
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,231
And there's the clown
that came out of her.

349
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,235
I really didn't want
to come here,

350
00:15:51,439 --> 00:15:53,077
but this is shaping up to be

351
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,510
one of the best Thanksgivings
I've had in a long time.

352
00:15:55,719 --> 00:15:57,118
Me, too.

353
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:00,552
Hey. Howard says you've
been making fun of him all day!

354
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:03,432
Now, both of you apologize right now!

355
00:16:04,319 --> 00:16:05,832
She's so tiny.

356
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,876
It's funny when she's mad.

357
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:16,638
All right, mister, lthink you owe

358
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:19,512
Howard and Bernadette an apology.

359
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:22,033
Perhaps you're right.

360
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,674
I'm sorry for my behavior.

361
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:27,790
I've had alcohol,
and it's caused me

362
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:28,954
to be inappropriate.

363
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,878
-It's okay.
-Don't worry about it.

364
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:32,353
Thank you.

365
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,319
Ain't she great?

366
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,355
Sheldon.

367
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,716
Now, how's about you get
us a couple of beers?

368
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,909
Thanks again for cooking.

369
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,348
Yeah, everything was delicious.

370
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,269
Well, I couldn't have done it
without my two favorite girls.

371
00:16:58,479 --> 00:17:00,993
Martha Stewart and Rachael Ray.

372
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:07,034
Hey, Sheldon,
what do you say we go outside

373
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,151
and throw around the old pigskin?

374
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:11,313
This is a Jewish house.

375
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,590
I don't think they have pigskin.

376
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:17,989
MOTHER: Did someone say pigskin?

377
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,956
Hey, I'm sorry about today.

378
00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:23,990
And I promise,
next time I get married,

379
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:25,234
it won't be ajoke.

380
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,032
It'll be for love.

381
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,753
Or money.

382
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,189
I'm sorry, too.

383
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,072
Don't be.
It's my fault.

384
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:36,632
I was a terrible husband.

385
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,310
I was never around.

386
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,272
I know I'm hard on you,

387
00:17:44,479 --> 00:17:46,947
but you're not the worst
son-in-Iaw in the world.

388
00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:49,753
Mike, that's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

389
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,349
Well, I'm drunk.

390
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,876
Ijust vomited on a lot of clowns.

391
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:27,476
