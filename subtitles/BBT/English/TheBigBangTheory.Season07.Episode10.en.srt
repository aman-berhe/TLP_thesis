00:00:02,439 --> 00:00:04,111
PENNY: Previously on
The Big Bang Theory...

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:05,793
Sheldon, did you just figure out

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,037
a method for synthesizing
a new stable super-heavy element?

4
00:00:09,239 --> 00:00:10,672
Did I?

5
00:00:10,879 --> 00:00:11,868
Well, that can't be right.

6
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:13,512
No one's ever done that before.

7
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,233
Except me because ljust did it!

8
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:16,997
J“ Sheldon and his brain, yeah I

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,951
J“ Sheldon and his brain, yeah! I

10
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,230
I've made a horrible mistake.

11
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:22,276
What are you talking about?

12
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,914
This table,
it's in square centimeters.

13
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,871
| read it as square meters.

14
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:28,228
You know what that means?

15
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:30,509
That Americans can't handle
the metric system?

16
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,951
Amy, I was off by a factor of 10,000.

17
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,276
But the Chinese team
found the element.

18
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:39,548
Yeah, well, they shouldn't have.

19
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:41,078
My calculations were wrong.

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,952
The greatest scientific
achievement of my life

21
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:44,638
is based on a blunder.

22
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,875
I'm not a genius.

23
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,149
I'm a fraud.

24
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,234
You know, Sheldon, in neuroscience,

25
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,829
we're forever finding something
in one part of the brain

26
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,234
that we thought was
someplace else.

27
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,829
Oh, great,
now I'm worse than a fraud.

28
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,073
|'m practically a biologist.

29
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:02,790
This is Science Friday.
I'm Ira Flatow.

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,992
My guest today is responsible
for the discovery of the first

31
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,509
stable super-heavy element.

32
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:09,947
Welcome, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

33
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:10,909
Thank you.

34
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,355
The university made me come here.

35
00:01:13,559 --> 00:01:14,469
I didn't want to.

36
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,271
Big fan of the show.

37
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,675
So, I understand
that you actually discovered

38
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,119
this element by mistake.

39
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,958
(SIGHS)

40
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,878
Yes.

41
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,794
And some people in the science
community are calling it

42
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,718
"The Wonder Blunder."

43
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,319
Who?
Give me their names.

44
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:34,838
I bet it's Wolowitz.

45
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,392
It's just such a fascinating story.

46
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,874
Your calculations are way off,

47
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:41,149
but they find the element anyway.

48
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,396
It's like misreading
a treasure map

49
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,670
and still finding the treasure.

50
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,598
Can we talk
about something else?

51
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,916
Do you know that I yodel?

52
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,039
That's interesting,
but this could be taking you

53
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:56,315
down the path
toward a Nobel Prize.

54
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:57,634
And in Chemistry, no less.

55
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,717
And wouldn't that be unusual?

56
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,956
Because you're a physicist.

57
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,151
Yes, yes, I'd be a physicist
with a Nobel in Chemistry.

58
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,078
Everyone laugh at the circus freak.

59
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,910
I don't need to sit
here and take this, Flatow.

60
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:12,192
It is because of bullies like you,

61
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,799
every day more and more Americans

62
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:15,876
are making the switch to television.

63
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,272
J“ (THEME SONG PLAYS) J“

64
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:43,948
President Seibert, I don't
know why you're yelling.

65
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,230
You're the one who
made me go on the radio.

66
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:48,953
I was expecting a professional
science interview,

67
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:52,310
not an attack by some
morning zoo shock jock.

68
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,878
Well, if the university
needs money so badly,

69
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,991
perhaps you should
start a swearjar.

70
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,790
Whoa! That one's worth a dollar.

71
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,308
I know you don't like it,

72
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,589
but every time
you do an interview,

73
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,518
it raises the profile
of the university.

74
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,118
That translates to funding.

75
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,070
Yeah, well, I'm notjust

76
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,316
some trained monkey
dancing for coins.

77
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:15,835
Of course you're not.

78
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,393
People love trained monkeys.

79
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,909
How can you not be happy?

80
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,553
You're tall, thin and famous.

81
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,591
Oh, my God,
I'm jealous of Sheldon.

82
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,278
Look, you're going to be
doing this stuff for a while.

83
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,550
You're just going to have to find
a way to get used to it.

84
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,351
But none of you know
what this is like.

85
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:35,392
Being celebrated for something
you wish you never did.

86
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,955
You clearly haven't been with me
at Mardi Gras.

87
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,917
Want to pause the video game
and help me clean up?

88
00:03:44,119 --> 00:03:45,029
I am cleaning up.

89
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,356
Look at the mess the Joker
made of Gotham City.

90
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:51,233
Come on, it's your friend
who's coming to stay here.

91
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,588
Raj grew up in India.

92
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,994
Trust me, he's seen worse.

93
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,556
Howie.

94
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,716
I promise I'll help out
the rest of the week.

95
00:03:58,919 --> 00:03:59,795
The rest of the week?

96
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:01,512
You said it was just
going to be a night or two.

97
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,392
Yeah, but if I told you a week,
would you have said yes?

98
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,830
-No!
-Then you left me no choice.

99
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:10,356
I love Raj, but that's
a long time for a house guest.

100
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,158
I know,
but they're tenting his building.

101
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:14,429
He can't find a hotel
he likes that allows dogs.

102
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,915
-He's bringing Cinnamon?
-For a whole week!

103
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,269
The nerve of some people.

104
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,196
Here comes
the Embarrassment Express.

105
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:28,354
With stops at Fraudville...

106
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,437
...WonderB|underberg...

107
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,633
...and Kansas City.

108
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,909
Because it's a hub.

109
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,989
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

110
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,639
AMY: Sheldon, can I come in?

111
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:39,874
-Do you have cookies?
-No.

112
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,559
Good. I don't deserve cookies.
Come in.

113
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:45,229
Wil?

114
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,714
Hey, Sheldon.
It's been a while.

115
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,035
Why are you here?

116
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,639
Amy said you were
having a rough time,

117
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,795
and I thought maybe we could talk.

118
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,194
Is that okay?

119
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:53,992
Certainly.

120
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,837
Although... right now,
I'm having a rough time

121
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,116
because there's
three people in my room,

122
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,832
and it's starting to feel
like a discotheque.

123
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:03,510
Sheldon, you said you were
unhappy getting attention

124
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,676
for something you wished
you never did.

125
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:07,437
Yeah, I know a little
something about that.

126
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,437
Oh, nonsense, Wil.

127
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:12,358
Your endless tweets
are not that bad.

128
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,314
I remember why it's been a while.

129
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,675
Sheldon, I was actually talking

130
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:19,153
about when I was a kid on Star Trek.

131
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,554
How could you not
like getting attention

132
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:22,987
for playing Wesley Crusher?

133
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,996
You were wonderful.

134
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,431
A know-it-all boy genius
with an eidetic memory.

135
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,277
Who couldn't relate to that?

136
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,953
Well, not everybody felt that way.

137
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,593
A lot of people
really hated the character,

138
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:36,790
and some of them
hated me because of it.

139
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:37,716
I would do interviews,

140
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,319
and people would be mean to me.

141
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,470
That just happened to me.

142
00:05:41,679 --> 00:05:43,192
Next time you're stuck for a tweet,

143
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,914
feel free to say
what ajerk Ira Flatow is.

144
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,313
Sheldon, the point is
Wil learned to embrace

145
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,478
that part of his life and
moved on to bigger and better things.

146
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,908
Yeah, I'm an author now,

147
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,394
I do public speaking,

148
00:05:55,599 --> 00:05:57,635
and I have my own web series
about board games.

149
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,752
We're trying to cheer him up, so...

150
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,269
I'm just saying
that there was a time

151
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:09,674
when lthought I would never get
out of Wesley Crusher's shadow.

152
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,318
But now, it's just one small part
of a pretty great life,

153
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,351
and it's a part
that I'm happy is there.

154
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,591
I do see what you're saying.

155
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:19,027
That helps.

156
00:06:19,239 --> 00:06:20,115
Good.

157
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,276
Would you two like to stay
and play trains with me?

158
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,310
-Sure.
-Okay.

159
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:24,349
Oh, great!

160
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:28,517
Now... | work the controls.

161
00:06:28,719 --> 00:06:29,629
I say "All aboard."

162
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,398
You sit quietly and watch.

163
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,673
Can I blow the whistle?

164
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,909
You should probably go.

165
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,031
You're going to brush
your teeth on my couch?

166
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,196
No, I'm going to brush
Cinnamon's teeth.

167
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:51,109
Why bother?

168
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,515
She spends half the time
licking her butt.

169
00:06:54,799 --> 00:06:55,993
And the other half
licking my face.

170
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,792
That's why I'm brushing her teeth.

171
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,637
Hey, guys.
Sorry I'm so late.

172
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:04,114
-Did you already have dinner?
-No, we were waiting for you.

173
00:07:04,359 --> 00:07:05,348
That's so sweet.

174
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,676
Yeah. So what do you
feel like making?

175
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,111
Howard, the poor thing
just got home from work.

176
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:13,150
Let me get you a glass of wine.

177
00:07:13,359 --> 00:07:14,633
l'll cook dinner.

178
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,512
-Oh, Raj, you're our guest.
-Don't be silly.

179
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,438
Sit.
You look like you've had a long day.

180
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,073
No, she always looks like that.

181
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:25,955
Because she married an idiot.

182
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,630
Thank you, Raj.

183
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:32,228
Please, this is my way
of thanking you

184
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,998
for letting me stay here.

185
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,839
Now, tell us all about your day.

186
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,758
Okay, well, first,

187
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,678
I was late to a meeting
because I was stuck in traffic.

188
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,632
I keep telling you to put
that traffic app on your phone.

189
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:45,354
Hey, when you got home today
complaining that you felt sick

190
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:47,709
from eating too manyjelly beans,
did He” you how to fix it?

191
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:48,829
No.

192
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,518
I said, "Aw, that must hurt,"
and | rubbed your belly.

193
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,352
I thought of you the whole time.

194
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,550
All I'm saying is
there's a time to just listen.

195
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,829
Thank you.

196
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,917
There's also a time to stop
eating too manyjelly beans.

197
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,599
And it's when you're ten.

198
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,233
Hello, President Siebert.

199
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:15,713
Thank you for taking my call.

200
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,387
| just wanted you to know
that you can now expect

201
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:22,069
enthusiastic participation
from me regarding my discovery.

202
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:23,268
No, no, no, no.

203
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,549
No need to thank me.

204
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,955
Thank my friend, Wil Wheaton.

205
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,795
For your information,
I have nine friends.

206
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:33,431
Ten if we include you.

207
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:36,192
Nine it is.

208
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,354
Eh, it's ten.
l'll count Wolowitz.

209
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:46,677
-He||o, friend Leonard.
-Hey, you're in a good mood.

210
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:48,073
I'm in a great mood.

211
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:50,156
Well, you're about to be
in an even better one.

212
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,510
I didn't want to say anything
until I knew for sure, but...

213
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,109
I've been re-running the tests
on your element in my lab

214
00:08:55,319 --> 00:08:56,991
and | disproved it.

215
00:08:57,199 --> 00:08:58,473
Your element does not exist!

216
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,551
Yeah, but what about
the Chinese research team?

217
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,516
They found it.

218
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:06,109
Yeah, it turns out someone added
simulated signals to the data files.

219
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,639
They faked the results.

220
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,750
Really?

221
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,517
Yes!
Do you know what that means?

222
00:09:10,719 --> 00:09:13,392
It means that all of this
attention that you hate goes away.

223
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:15,351
-So no more interviews?
-No, it's all over.

224
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,232
-I can't believe it.
-Well, you're welcome.

225
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,510
You robbed me
of my greatest achievement!

226
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,396
What?!

227
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,079
I'm back down to nine friends!

228
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,235
Make it eight.
I'm sick of Wolowitz, too!

229
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,755
I don't understand.

230
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,679
A|| you've done since you discovered
this stupid element was complain.

231
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:34,948
I was trying to make you happy!

232
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,469
By taking away
my only claim to fame?

233
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,079
Well, if you wanted
to make me happy,

234
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,429
you could have told me ajoke.

235
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,632
Or shown me a cute video
of a koala and an otter

236
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,068
becoming unlikely friends.

237
00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:48,349
There is no winning with you.

238
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,630
And koalas and otters
don't even live near each other!

239
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,950
That's what makes
their friendship unlikely!

240
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,910
Hey!
What's with all the yelling?

241
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,794
Leonard disproved my element.

242
00:09:57,999 --> 00:10:00,559
Now all the attention
is going to go away.

243
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:01,987
Oh, that's great.
You must be thrilled!

244
00:10:02,199 --> 00:10:04,508
That's it!
I'm down to seven friends.

245
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,635
He's counting Hobbits
and superheroes, right?

246
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,952
When I thought the element was real,
I didn't want it.

247
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,718
But now that Leonard
made it not exist,

248
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,478
I want it more
than anything in the world.

249
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:17,636
(STAMMERS) The element
never existed.

250
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,352
I didn't take it away,
science took it away.

251
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,390
Be mad at science.

252
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,511
Don't you dare use
science against me.

253
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,471
Science is my best friend!

254
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,272
Oh, good,
I'm back up to eight.

255
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:30,595
Will you tell him
he's out of his mind.

256
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,710
Actually, I get what he's saying.

257
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,796
Yes! Nine!

258
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,273
Welcome back, buddy.

259
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,272
It's like if you're dating
someone you're not that into,

260
00:10:38,479 --> 00:10:39,468
and then they break up with you

261
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,829
and then you want them
more than ever.

262
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,439
I have no idea what
she's talking about.

263
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:44,948
But we're ganging up on you
so I agree.

264
00:10:46,439 --> 00:10:48,350
Okay, Sheldon, what do you
want me to do,

265
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,629
hide the information?

266
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,273
If I don't publish it,
it's just a matter of time

267
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,390
before someone else does.

268
00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:54,112
No, no, of course
you have to publish.

269
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:55,957
That's your responsibility
as a scientist.

270
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,559
Doing otherwise
would be unethical.

271
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:58,748
You have no choice.

272
00:10:59,479 --> 00:11:00,468
Fine, l'll publish.

273
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:01,873
Can you believe this guy?

274
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,877
Oh, Raj did the dishes.

275
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,398
How do you know
I didn't do them?

276
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,033
Because once,
when all the knives were dirty,

277
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,912
you cut a bagel with your keys.

278
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,918
Good morning, everybody.

279
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,951
I picked up coffee
while I was out.

280
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:23,434
Bernadette,
here's your soy peppermint mocha.

281
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:25,516
You didn't have to do that.

282
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:26,595
Oh, my pleasure, and don't worry

283
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,676
about your presentation today.

284
00:11:27,879 --> 00:11:28,834
You're going to be great.

285
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,917
Yeah, you're going to
knock it out of the park.

286
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,951
What presentation do I have today?

287
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:35,788
Just go.

288
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:40,987
He loves you.

289
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,390
What are you doing?

290
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:43,588
Are you trying
to make me look bad?

291
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,074
I'm just being
a good house guest.

292
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,473
No, you're being
a better husband than lam.

293
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,159
Doing the dishes,
getting coffee,

294
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,315
knowing about her life?

295
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,668
Who does that?

296
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,678
Oh, come on,
I brought you one, too.

297
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,278
I don't want coffee.

298
00:11:55,479 --> 00:11:56,673
That's why I got you
hot chocolate.

299
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:58,710
Give me that.

300
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,309
Just stop showing me up.

301
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,748
Howard, listen to me.

302
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,109
You're a great husband.

303
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:06,594
Yes, your listening skills
could use some work.

304
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,109
But it's amazing
how far you've come

305
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,988
given that you're an only child
raised by an over-protective mom.

306
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:15,552
Is this getting weird?

307
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:16,669
Hang on.

308
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:22,597
Oh, yes.

309
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,676
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
LEONARD: Hey.

310
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,029
| just wanted to let you know
that I posted my findings.

311
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,229
I saw.

312
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:33,511
And ljust posted
a retraction of my paper.

313
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,393
Now the whole scientific community
knows I was wrong.

314
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:38,954
These things happen
all the time, Sheldon.

315
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,070
Not to me.

316
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:42,110
The only other retraction
lever had to issue

317
00:12:42,319 --> 00:12:44,674
was when I was seven
and | conceded that my brother

318
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:47,074
was the greatest ninja
in East Texas.

319
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:51,147
But that was just a ploy
to get my face out of his armpit.

320
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,272
(SPEAKS WITH IMPEDIMENT)
There he is!

321
00:12:55,439 --> 00:12:56,758
It's my favorite superhero,

322
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,756
the Retractor!

323
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,075
Come on,
don't give him a hard time.

324
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,314
I'm sorry, Cooper.

325
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:05,952
| retract it.

326
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,077
By the way, Hofstadter,

327
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,510
nice job disproving
the Chinese team.

328
00:13:11,719 --> 00:13:12,549
It's not a big deal.

329
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,112
It's a huge deal.

330
00:13:14,319 --> 00:13:16,787
Cooper, maybe physics
just isn't your thing.

331
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:19,709
Have you ever considered
a career in retail?

332
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,559
That way you could take
things back for a living.

333
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:25,274
Okay, Barry, that's enough.

334
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,595
Oh, no, that's okay.

335
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,518
I can fight my own battles.

336
00:13:28,719 --> 00:13:31,233
Isn't that right, "Bawwy"?

337
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,789
|s...?

338
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:37,433
Is that a reference
to my speech impediment?

339
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:41,154
That's pretty hurtful.

340
00:13:41,359 --> 00:13:42,508


341
00:13:42,719 --> 00:13:44,596
I can't control it.

342
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,870
You're right,

343
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:48,831
that was uncalled for.

344
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,189
I take it back.

345
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,116
Of course you do.

346
00:13:51,319 --> 00:13:53,196
Because you're the Retractor!

347
00:13:57,439 --> 00:13:59,316
Raj, this dinner was amazing.

348
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,395
If you're here much longer,

349
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,318
I'm going to have
to buy bigger clothes.

350
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:03,269
Nonsense.

351
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,390
You need a little fattening up.

352
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,192
You've been looking
too skinny lately.

353
00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:07,633
Aww.

354
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,030
Howie, how come you never
say anything sweet like that?

355
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:10,956
What are you talking about?

356
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,149
Remember last week,
when I asked you

357
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,475
if you were wearing Spanx
and you weren't?

358
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,272
How's that different?

359
00:14:17,319 --> 00:14:18,547
Maybe you could try being
more thoughtful,

360
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:20,078
like your friend Raj.

361
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:22,509
Yeah, well, maybe you could
try being more like Raj.

362
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,438
-Oh, really?
-Yeah, yeah.

363
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,788
He packed me
a lunch this morning.

364
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:28,877
And there was a note inside
that said, "Go get them."

365
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,359
Like I don't do enough around here.

366
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,629
Now I need to pack your lunch?

367
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,199
And by the way, why do you need
a note telling you

368
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,435
to go get them?
You're a grown man!

369
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,794
You should know to "go get them!"

370
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,069
I do know to "go get them,"

371
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,759
but sometimes
it's nice to have emotional support

372
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:42,710
when I'm going and getting them!

373
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,307
Hey, hey, do you hear yourselves?

374
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,511
Let'sjust, you know, all calm down
and take a step back.

375
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,678
This is stupid.
Why are we fighting?

376
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:52,675
I don't know.

377
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:55,837
I guess I wasjust feeling
like I'm a lousy husband.

378
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,268
You're not a lousy husband.

379
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,515
You're a great husband.

380
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,676
I was the one feeling
like a lousy wife.

381
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:02,835
Are you kidding?
You're the best.

382
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,314
I know what the problem is.

383
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:05,634
It's him!

384
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:08,750
Oh, what did I do?

385
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,632
You made us feel like
we're not trying hard enough.

386
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:12,636
Yeah, we were totally fine
half-assing our marriage

387
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,432
till you showed up.

388
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,029
Look, I'm sorry
you're upset with me,

389
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,673
but ljust have to say
it's nice to see

390
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:20,153
the two of you on the same page.

391
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,759
Oh, it does feel good

392
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,279
to have you backing me up for once.

393
00:15:23,479 --> 00:15:25,515
-| back you up all the time!
-That is not--

394
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,073
-He's doing it again!
-What is wrong with you?!

395
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,918
I can't believe they kicked you out.

396
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,838
I can't believe
they're still married.

397
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,790
Oh, no, |forgot Cinnamon's
toothbrush at Howard's.

398
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:40,115
I guess you're sharing
with Daddy again.

399
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,710
Bark once if you need me
to call PETA.

400
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,916
What's that animal doing
in our apartment?

401
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,111
Oh, relax, she's in her crate.
She can't get out.

402
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,753
I have two words for you:

403
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,711
Jurassic Park.

404
00:15:59,439 --> 00:16:01,794
This dayjust keeps
getting worse and worse.

405
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:03,273
You know, if it makes
you feel any better--

406
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,311
-It probably won't.
-You're probably right.

407
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,197
Sheldon, it's a beautiful night.

408
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,754
Why don't you and |
go for a nice walk together?

409
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,314
Oh, everything isjust
sex with you isn't it?

410
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,109
Sheldon, |think
you might find the support

411
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:18,593
you're looking for, if you realize

412
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:20,755
that relationships
are a give and take.

413
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,108
She can only be there for you

414
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,958
as much as you are for her.

415
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:25,672
Thank you, Rajesh.

416
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:27,870
And, Amy, you need
to be patient with Sheldon,

417
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,912
instead of pressuring him
to accept intimacy on your terms.

418
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,192
You should probably go.

419
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,990
|'m Ira Flatow,
and this is Science Friday.

420
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,031
I'd like to welcome back
Dr. Sheldon Cooper,

421
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,037
who thought
he had discovered

422
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,674
a new super-heavy element
only to have it disproved

423
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:51,029
by my next guest,
Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.

424
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,275
Welcome to Science Friday,
gentlemen.

425
00:16:52,439 --> 00:16:53,508
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

426
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,998
Ira, ifl may, I'd like to apologize
for my behavior last week.

427
00:16:58,199 --> 00:16:59,518
It's all right.

428
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,917
Now, isn't there something
you'd like to say to me?

429
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:05,788
No.

430
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,028
Now, Dr. Hofstadter.

431
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,309
Can you walk us
through the process

432
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,112
you used to disprove his theory?

433
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,754
-We||...
-I believe I can answer that.

434
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,598
He asked me.

435
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:16,788
Fine.

436
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:17,796
As I was saying...

437
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,194
You're telling it wrong.
lra...

438
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,114
...to really understand the story here,

439
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,639
you have to start
at the very beginning.

440
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:25,558
A small town in East Texas,
where a young genius named...

441
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,352
-She|don...
-That's right, Sheldon Cooper.

442
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,469
He was bitten by his neighbor's dog,

443
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:32,317
leading to his first
scientific breakthrough,

444
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,476
the doggie death-ray.

445
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,749
Which, sadly, he couldn't build

446
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:39,519
because Santa wouldn't bring
him enriched uranium.

447
00:17:39,719 --> 00:17:42,153
You know, I'd really like
to hear it from Dr. Hofstadter,

448
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:43,394
if it's okay with you.

449
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:45,271
What a surprise.

450
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,869
Did you invite me back
just so you could ignore me?

451
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:49,637
Actually, I didn't invite you.

452
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:51,067
You came in, you took a seat,

453
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,747
and I'm not comfortable
with confrontation.

454
00:17:55,719 --> 00:17:57,869
LEONARD: Sheldon, this interview
is supposed to be about me.

455
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,991
SHELDON: Well, that seems
like a snooze.

456
00:18:00,199 --> 00:18:01,188
Even for public radio.

457
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,398
You know,
if we did a shot every time

458
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:05,554
they said something embarrassing,

459
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,637
this would be one hell
of a drinking game.

460
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:09,750
A little early for alcohol, isn't it?

461
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:11,551
SHELDON: You know, Idon'tjust say
smart things about science.

462
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,875
Ialso yodel.

463
00:18:13,199 --> 00:18:14,791
J“ (SHELDON YODELING) J“

464
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,315
I'll get the vodka.
