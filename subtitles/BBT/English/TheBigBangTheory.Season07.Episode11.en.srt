00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,114
MAN (OVER COMPUTER): In the lead,
the left-side competitor:

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,559
Wow, you're really
good at this.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,910
Well, I have an extremely
low center of gravity.

4
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:14,278
I'm like a pyramid.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,674
How you doing over there?

6
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:21,795
Oh, I hope it'sjust a sprain.

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,752
lcannnt walk into that ER

8
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:26,511
with another video game injury.

9
00:00:27,999 --> 00:00:30,274
Hey, Sheldon,
you want to play next?

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,749
Oh, lwould,
but I'm on my way out.

11
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,353
-Where?
-Texas.

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,951
Right now? Why?

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,434
-ls someone sick?
-Yes.

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,592
My sister's uterus came
down with a baby.

15
00:00:43,999 --> 00:00:45,637
Oh, she's pregnant?
That's great.

16
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:47,517
You're gone an uncle--
Uncle Sheldon.

17
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:49,954
No, lwill be Uncle Dr. Cooper.

18
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:52,990
How come you never said
she was pregnant?

19
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,918
Well, I never told you
about my brother's kidney stone.

20
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,109
You want to hear about everything

21
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,872
that comes out
of my family's genitals?

22
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,559
Well, congrats, and it's nice

23
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:01,947
you're gonna be
there for your sister.

24
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,554
Yes. I'm filling in for her
husband who's recovering

25
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:06,755
from a horrible motorcycle accident.

26
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:08,915
Lucky duck.

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,591
Wow, so, how long will you be gone?

28
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,318
Well, she's due tomorrow.

29
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,351
Although it did take her
six years to finish high school,

30
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:16,713
so who knows?

31
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,872
Can I give you a ride to the airport?

32
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:21,473
Oh, no, thank you, I don't want
to be an inconvenience.

33
00:01:22,279 --> 00:01:24,349
Chop-chop, Leonard.
We leave in ten minutes.

34
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,397
J“ (THEME SONG PLAYS) J“

35
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,109
All right, here's the deal.

36
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,437
Sheldon is gone, so the tree
decorating rules are out the window.

37
00:01:55,639 --> 00:01:57,357
Yeah, which means
we don't have to use

38
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,273
his ridiculous
ornament-spacing template.

39
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,191
And I'm happy to report
its Kickstarter campaign

40
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,952
is holding strong at zero dollars.

41
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,190
Wait, so Star Wars
and Star Trek characters

42
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,799
can go on the same branch?

43
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,469
I know, it's crazy.

44
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:13,391
Welcome to the Thunderdome, people!

45
00:02:13,559 --> 00:02:14,628
ALL: Woo!

46
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,436
I've never done this before.
It's kind of fun.

47
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,990
Yeah, if your mom could see
her little Bar Mitzvah boy right now,

48
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:21,069
she'd have a heart attack.

49
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:23,036
Good idea, I'll take a picture.

50
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,152
Honey, I'm a little strapped
for cash this year,

51
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,794
so for Christmas l was
thinking of giving you...

52
00:02:32,559 --> 00:02:33,469
...this.

53
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,395
I love it.

54
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,675
Okay.

55
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,558
But it is what you got me last year.

56
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,637
-Yeah.
-And last night.

57
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:44,994
(KNOCKING)
Hello.

58
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,110
Hi, Stuart.

59
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,630
Oh, good, I'm glad you guys
didn't wait for me to start.

60
00:02:48,799 --> 00:02:52,474
Although you said 1:00
and it's 1:00. That's fine.

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,796
(RINGING)

62
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,315
Oh, it's probably Sheldon.

63
00:02:58,279 --> 00:02:59,155
Hi, Sheldon.

64
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,151
Everybody's here, say hi.

65
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:02,189
-Hi.
-Hey, buddy.

66
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:02,917
Hey.

67
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,870
-Howdy.
-Hi.

68
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,274
Hello.

69
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,554
SHELDON: The second
[90 out of town

70
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,550
you throw a Christmas
party without me?

71
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,359
Yeah, kind of.

72
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:15,556
That's so thoughtful.
You guys are the best.

73
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,312
Hey, how's your sister?

74
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,516
She went into labor arr hour ago.

75
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,115
That's wonderful.
So you're at the hospital?

76
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,794
No, she chose to have a home
birth... because she wants

77
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:29,315
to live in the Stone Age
and a cave wasn't available.

78
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,557
You know, many people believe

79
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,472
that home births are better
because the mother

80
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,959
is in a warm, comfortable environment

81
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,951
where she can be
nurtured by loved ones.

82
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,633
And turn the bedroom floor

83
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:42,233
into an amniotic Slip 'n Slide.

84
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,038
WOMAN: Shelly, come on!

85
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,077
Your sister's fully dilated

86
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,479
and she wants
a nice family picture

87
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,478
before there's blood everywhere!

88
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,039
SHELDON: Oh, boy.

89
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,670
Ipicked the wrong day
to wear my good robot T-shirt.

90
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,159
(BEEPING)

91
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,353
If you were having Sheldon's baby

92
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,192
would you really want him
in the room?

93
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,077
Yeah, if he's in the room
when they're making the baby,

94
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,912
I'll give you ten dollars.

95
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,079
Hey, I brought over
It's a Wonderful Life

96
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:11,394
if you guys want to watch it later.

97
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,477
-Oh, I love that movie.
-l've never seen it.

98
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,272
-Me neither.
-lt's great.

99
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,114
It's Christmas time and
Jimmy Stewart's really depressed

100
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,510
and he's gonnajump
off a bridge and kill himself...

101
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,438
Don't need to see it.
Living it.

102
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,714
But then he gets to see
what the world

103
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:27,029
would be like
if he'd never been born.

104
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,473
Hey, you ever imagine
what that would be like?

105
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:29,668
Not being born?

106
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,353
(KNOCKING)
What do you think?

107
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:32,713
What do you think?

108
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:34,597
What do you think?

109
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,477
You make jokes about Sheldon,

110
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:39,754
but if it weren't for him,

111
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,752
I don't think any of us would be
sitting in this room right now.

112
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,439
Really? Sheldon not being here

113
00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:46,829
is the main reason I'm in this room.

114
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,914
It's true.

115
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,559
None of you would know me.

116
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,239
You wouldn't know Bernadette.

117
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,550
-You wouldn't be dating Penny.
-You don't know that.

118
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,317
I've been going to the
Cheesecake Factory for years.

119
00:04:57,479 --> 00:04:58,355
I could have picked her up.

120
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:00,032
(ALL LAUGHING)

121
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,835
Oh, you weren't joking.

122
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,716
No.

123
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:07,198
Okay, sweetie, let me tell you

124
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:09,077
exactly how that
would have gone down.

125
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,672
I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna ask her out.

126
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,673
I'm gonna squirt chocolate milk
out of my nipples.

127
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,679
Sorry, I thought we're saying things
that are never gonna happen.

128
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,956
Maybe this time
he's going to do it.

129
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,872
Hope you're thirsty, here it comes.

130
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:29,469
Watch me.

131
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,990
Hey, you guys ready to order
or you need a few minutes?

132
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,833
-(STAMMER|NG)
-A few minutes it is.

133
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,952
You didn't ask her out,
but that was a lot of sounds.

134
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,119
You guys are making me nervous.

135
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,632
Fine, then go talk to her
on your own.

136
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:46,549
lwill.

137
00:05:53,679 --> 00:05:55,715
-Excuse me.
-Yeah?

138
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:58,837
Hi... I'm Leonard?

139
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,315
Really? You don't sound so sure.

140
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,037
No, I am he.

141
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,519
Anyway...

142
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:12,991
There's been something I've wanted
to ask you for a long time.

143
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,115
What's that?

144
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:16,873
l was wondering,
if you're not too busy...

145
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,114
...if you'd be interested in...

146
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,592
...telling me where the restroom is?

147
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,078
I think you're too late.

148
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:32,673
Come on, lwould not
have peed my pants.

149
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:36,551
-She nailed it.
-Sounds about right.

150
00:06:37,559 --> 00:06:40,596
But, you forget,
I did ask you out in real life.

151
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,871
Which couldn't have happened
if you didn't live across the hall from her

152
00:06:42,999 --> 00:06:44,512
which couldn't have
happened without Sheldon.

153
00:06:44,719 --> 00:06:45,947
Same goes with you guys.

154
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,274
lf Leonard wasn't with Penny,

155
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:48,838
she never would have set you up.

156
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,519
Doesn't matter.
Bernadette still would've been working

157
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:51,748
at The Cheesecake Factory,

158
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,797
and I still would've been
working this beefcake factory.

159
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,393
You would've been all over me.

160
00:06:58,799 --> 00:06:59,868
Well....

161
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,398
Hey, Penny, can ltake that table?

162
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:05,469
Sure, why?

163
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,152
The one in the turtleneck is cute.

164
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:11,069
Open wide,
here comes the happy train.

165
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,589
Mm-hm...
Chug-a chug-a, yum, yum.

166
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,557
Hang on.

167
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,834
You got a...
You got a little something.

168
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,558
Never mind.

169
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,070
-(LAUGH|NG)
-Oh, man, that is so us.

170
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,997
You know, maybe you and I
wouldn't be together,

171
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,752
but you wouldn't have
done so great yourself.

172
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:44,193
-Why?
-Because I know exactly

173
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:46,395
the kind of guy you
would've ended up with.

174
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:50,273
Hey, babe.

175
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,438
Hey. Did you remember
to pay the rent?

176
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:54,988
Better. | used the money
to buy these magic beans.

177
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,278
He may be an idiot, but at least
he didn't pee himself.

178
00:08:01,799 --> 00:08:03,198
Hold on.

179
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,716
Aw, babe, I peed myself.

180
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,317
(GASPS)
Me, too.

181
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,233
The end.

182
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,913
(RINGING)

183
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,630
Hi, Sheldon.

184
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,869
Everything okay?

185
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,958
No, it's not.

186
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:30,432
I've seen things.

187
00:08:31,799 --> 00:08:32,993
Lady things.

188
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,312
Listen to me.

189
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,908
That is not the way
they usually look.

190
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:44,187
It doesn't matter.

191
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,550
This is no way
to make new humans.

192
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,592
People coming out of people.

193
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,272
It's some kind of dirty magic show.

194
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,319
WOMAN: Sheldon Lee Cooper:

195
00:08:55,479 --> 00:08:57,754
You get back
in this room right now.

196
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,148
And bring a mop.

197
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,433
Did you hear that?

198
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:02,594
A mop.

199
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:05,348
[have two PhDs yet
somehow I'm the janitor

200
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,919
of my sister's birth canal.

201
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,390
Hey, Sheldon sent us all
an e-mail.

202
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:17,556
"Happy holidays from Texas."

203
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,158
And there's pictures.

204
00:09:19,319 --> 00:09:21,310
Ah! Don't open them.
Do not open them.

205
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,915
Oh, come on.
Childbirth is a natural, beautiful--

206
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:28,957
Oh, it's like someone
sawed a cow in half.

207
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:34,913
My father's a gynecologist,
lthink I can handle it.

208
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,355
And, now I'm gay.

209
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:40,994
You know, lwas thinking,

210
00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:42,712
without Sheldon most of us
would have never met,

211
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:44,676
but Penny would still
live across from him.

212
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,478
And with Leonard out of the picture,

213
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,993
we all know what that would mean.

214
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:50,714
We do?

215
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,275
(FLIRTATIOUSLY) Hey, Sheldon.

216
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,793
Hello.

217
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,390
Doing laundry?

218
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:06,190
Of course I'm doing laundry.

219
00:10:06,359 --> 00:10:07,838
Saturday night is laundry night,

220
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,229
and I'm in a laundry room, so...

221
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,038
I believe your inference is justified.

222
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,470
(LAUGHING)
My inference is justified.

223
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:17,028
Sheldon, you are so funny.

224
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,997
Anyway, I need to do my laundry, too,

225
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,833
because these clothes are so dirty.

226
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,070
Almost as dirty as the dirty girl
who's wearing them.

227
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,276
Okay, that's enough.

228
00:10:32,439 --> 00:10:34,828
-Disagree.
-Keep going.

229
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:39,035
So, what do you think?

230
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,751
Atad asymmetrical,
but nothing to be concerned about.

231
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,197
Please, Sheldon. I need you.

232
00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:50,429
To... what?

233
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,429
To take me.

234
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,353
I'm not taking you anywhere
till you put on a shirt.

235
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:00,188
Come on, Sheldon.
You and me right here.

236
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,755
Penny, for the thousandth time,

237
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,792
I'm saving myself
for someone special.

238
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:09,435
Perhaps a cute
bespectacled neuroscientist

239
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,273
with hair the color of mud.

240
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,312
I think I know how
to change your mind.

241
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:18,267
-That's enough.
-(GROAN|NG |N DISGUST)

242
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,589
l was okay with it.

243
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,873
(RINGING)

244
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,194
How's it going, Sheldon?

245
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,112
Actually, much better.

246
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,674
Oh, good.
Is the baby born yet?

247
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:32,716
I don't know.
I just got back.

248
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,796
Where'd you go?

249
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,679
My mother asked me
to get some towels.

250
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,637
I took advantage
of the vague request

251
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,791
and went to Bed, Bath 8. Beyond.

252
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,039
(WOMAN SCREAMING)

253
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,073
Excuse me! I'm on the phone!

254
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,959
So rude.

255
00:11:52,439 --> 00:11:55,749
Here's another one.
Penny, if it weren't for Sheldon,

256
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,072
you never would have met
comic book legend Stan Lee.

257
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:02,627
Great.

258
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,272
At least Leonard, Howard and I
would have always been friends.

259
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:10,915
Hey, how come you three never
got an apartment together?

260
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,076
We talked about it,
but Howard was in

261
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,708
a pretty serious
relationship with his mom.

262
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,711
I lived with her to save money.

263
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:20,028
Yeah, you didn't have
to buy groceries

264
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:21,154
because you were breast-feeding.

265
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,629
So I guess if it weren't for me,

266
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,869
you'd still be living with her, huh?

267
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,792
Not exactly.

268
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,949
What do you mean, not exactly?

269
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:32,798
Well, things would be
a little different.

270
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,637
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Howard, where's my lunch? I'm starving!

271
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,118
I know you're starving.
The neighbors know you're starving.

272
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,113
There's starving people in Africa
who know you're starving!

273
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,629
MRS. WOLOWITZ: That's it?
There's not enough food!

274
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,309
HOWARD: Well, you cleaned out Earth!
I don't know what else to do!

275
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,918
How is this any different?

276
00:12:57,079 --> 00:12:58,751
You didn't let me finish.

277
00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:01,157
Here you go, Mother.

278
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,069
FEMALE VOICE:
You're a good boy, Howard!

279
00:13:04,239 --> 00:13:07,868
Such a good boy!

280
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:14,749
Wait, did she die
or did you kill her?

281
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,273
Tomato, tomahto.
The important thing is she's dead.

282
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,711
Hey, so how come you two
didn't move in together?

283
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:26,392
This guy wanted
a place of his own

284
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,710
because he was sure he was
gonna be a ladies' man.

285
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,192
Yeah, I was wrong.

286
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,840
But I do think you and I
would have had a great time.

287
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:38,593
Come on, Leonard, dinner.

288
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,597
Coming.

289
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:49,949
LEONARD: Hang on.

290
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:51,791
Why would I be fat?

291
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:54,995
You'd have no girlfriend
to see you naked,

292
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:57,627
you'd try to fill the void
with food,

293
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,394
and I'm an enabler who once
deep-fried a pancake.

294
00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:02,997
Why can't you be fat too?

295
00:14:04,999 --> 00:14:06,512
What do you want
to do for dessert?

296
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,835
I think there's still
half a cake from breakfast.

297
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,315
No, there's not.

298
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:21,789
Hey, guys.

299
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:25,317
BOTH: Stuart!

300
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:27,352
What are you doing?

301
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,157

...just wanted to be

303
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,312
Yeah, but why are you fat?

304
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,518
Because Leonard was fat.

305
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,358
Amy, what about you?

306
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,471
What do you think you'd be doing
if you never met Sheldon?

307
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,516
It's hard to say,

308
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,676
my life would be so... different.

309
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,793
You can say "better."
Sheldon can't hear you.

310
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,874
I don't know.

I'll stop now.

(RINGING)

317
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,633
How's it going, Sheldon?

318
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,750
(PANTING) That's it.

319
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,109
The baby's here.

320
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,756
It's a boy.

321
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,512
(ALL CHEERING)
Congrats.

322
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:45,152
Oh, thank you.

323
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,469
I wasn 't sure I was
going to make it.

324
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,588
But my mother
gave me some ice chips,

325
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,795
my sister told me to breathe.

326
00:15:53,999 --> 00:15:55,717
And I just thought
to myself, "Sheldon,

327
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:57,790
if you can make it through
the Green Lantern movie,

328
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,598
you can make it through this. "

329
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,113
Well, good for you, buddy.

330
00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:03,547
We'll let you get back in there.

331
00:16:03,719 --> 00:16:05,311
No, no, I'm not
going back in there.

332
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,118
That baby is so irritating.

333
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:10,632
He has literally been crying
his entire life.

334
00:16:12,479 --> 00:16:14,788
Oh, he's already taking
after Uncle Shelly.

335
00:16:16,439 --> 00:16:18,794
-Come on, Sheldon, you should go.
-Why?

336
00:16:19,439 --> 00:16:21,111
Well, you always
complain that you never

337
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,076
had an intelligent
role model growing up,

338
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,838
and now you can
be one for your nephew.

339
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,991
(SIGHS)
All right, I'll go.

340
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,150
But from what I've seen,
his attention span

341
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:34,071
is as limited as his bladder control.

342
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,428
(BEEPING)

343
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,632
You actually got him to do it.

344
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,439
Yeah, you keep saying how much
Sheldon has affected all of us,

345
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,716
but you've clearly
had an impact on him.

346
00:16:43,439 --> 00:16:45,236
If that were true,
I wouldn't still be living alone.

347
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,388
Well, not exactly alone.

348
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,636
I do have a 50 pound sack of rice

349
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,472
with one of Sheldon's T-shirts on it.

350
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,759
I'm telling you, Sheldon cares
for you more than you think.

351
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,395
lwish I could believe you.

352
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,120
I also wish there wasn't a mouse
living in Rice Sheldon.

353
00:17:05,999 --> 00:17:08,991
Hang on, I'm gonna give you a little
early Christmas present.

354
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,309
I'm gonna show you something,
but if you ever told Sheldon,

355
00:17:12,479 --> 00:17:14,231
he'd probably never
speak to me again.

356
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:16,191
So, if you want to tell him,
that's fine.

357
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:18,754
Look.

358
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,078
I don't understand.

359
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:25,033
He made you his screensaver.

360
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:27,709
Oh.

361
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,833
Wow.

362
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,638
I had no idea.

363
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,916
(EXCITED) He is so into me.

364
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:39,111
Wait, wait, where'd | go?

365
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:41,915
Oh, well, it's you, Swamp Thing,

366
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,833
Stephen Hawking, Spider-Man --
but, look, you're in the mix.

367
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,714
lam in the mix.
And I'm the hottest one.

368
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:50,588
Who's that?

369
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,513
-Oh, Madame Curie.
-That's fine, she's dead.

370
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,068
You okay?

371
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,956
Just really glad you're back.

372
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,110
SHELDON: Me, too.

373
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,478
I got a lot of TV to catch up on.

374
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:23,078
I missed you.

375
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,149
To quote Han Solo, "I know."

376
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,596
Did you miss me?

377
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:34,954
I would've preferred
to have you there with me.

378
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:35,950
Oh...

379
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,794
Or instead of me.

380
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,952
Did you hold the baby?

381
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,951
-I did.
-And?

382
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,830
How did it make you feel?

383
00:18:47,999 --> 00:18:50,433
Looking into the blank, innocent eyes

384
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,836
of a creature that couldn't begin to
comprehend anything I was saying?

385
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:56,395
Basically just another day
at the office.

386
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:04,031
I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna ask her out.

387
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,359
Yeah, and chocolate milk is
gonna squirt out of my nipples.

388
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,350
Put up or shut up.
You make it, I'll drink it.

389
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,714
You guys need anything else?

390
00:19:19,879 --> 00:19:21,835
Your phone number
and one more cheesecake.

391
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,119
I'm sorry, I have a boyfriend.

392
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,919
In fact, there he is now.

393
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:38,753
Ready to go, sweetheart?

394
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:40,272
Not until I get my kiss.

395
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,588
