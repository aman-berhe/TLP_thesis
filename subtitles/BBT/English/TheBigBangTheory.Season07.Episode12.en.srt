1
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,150
This is nice,
that we all get to eat together.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,876
Absolutely.

3
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,669
Can we maybe put the phones down and
have an actual human conversation?

4
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:33,872
We can, but thanks to Steve Jobs,
we don't have to.

5
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,151
Guys. Guys,
you're never gonna believe this.

6
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,396
-What happened?
-I just got a part on a TV show!

7
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,828
-That's great!
-Congratulations!

8
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,110
-G uys!
-Oh, yeah!

9
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,517
-Yay, Penny!
-What's the show?

10
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,952
NCII, or, you know, NCSTDâ€”

11
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:52,592
I don't know, it's...

12
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,268
It's the one with all the letters
and I'm gonna be on it!

13
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,152
-That's amazing!
-Yeah.

14
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,555
-What's your part?
-I play a customer in a diner

15
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,352
and lflirt with Mark Harmon.

16
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,552
Ooh, Mark Harmon,
he's a dreamboat.

17
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,310
-So it's just flirting?
-Well, yeah. Why?

18
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,078
No reason. ljust think it's sexier

19
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:11,678
when things are left
to the imagination.

20
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,119
He's wrong.

21
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,869
: (THEME some) I

22
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:43,514
So I read a study that
says a man with a dog

23
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,870
is three times more likely
to get a woman's phone number.

24
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,911
Is it true even when
the man lets his dog

25
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,314
lick peanut butter off his tongue?

26
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,590
I don't see why not.

27
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:55,312
If you're really desperate
to meet women

28
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:57,475
and like having food
eaten out of your mouth,

29
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,511
I could set you up with my mom.

30
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,552
Why is that funny?

31
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,552
That's just unhygienic.

32
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,314
-lt's ajoke.
-I don't think so.

33
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,039
I believe that ajoke
is a brief oral narrative

34
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,390
with a climactic humorous twist.

35
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,352
For example,
Wolowitz's mother is so fat

36
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,516
that she decided
to go on a diet,

37
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:23,358
or exercise, or both.

38
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,629
See? The twist is that people
don't usually change.

39
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,118
Well, they don't.

40
00:02:36,279 --> 00:02:39,032
Hey, guys, don't forget,
my episode's on TV tomorrow night.

41
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:40,433
-We'll be there.
-Can we bring anything?

42
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,790
Oh, that's so sweet of you,
but I was gonna steal food from here.

43
00:02:42,999 --> 00:02:45,274
You know, my treat.

44
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:50,238
Wait, if Howard's mother is coming,
then you should also steal marbles.

45
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,554
Because she's obese,
and hippos are obese,

46
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,435
and in the popular board game Hungry
Hungry Hippos, they eat marbles.

47
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,475
Maybe I need to dumb
these down for you.

48
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,595
-Leonard, do you think I'm funny?
-No.

49
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,030
-Do you?
-I think I'm hysterical.

50
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,274
I take it back.
That was funny.

51
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,917
The philosopher Henri Bergson
says it's funny

52
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,714
when a human being
behaves like an object.

53
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,071
I bet that bit killed
at The Chuckle Hut.

54
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,915
Oh, he didn't perform stand-up
comedy, he was a philosopher.

55
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,673
You know, lthink
we're zeroing in on your problem.

56
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,391
Perhaps l'll spend some time

57
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,749
developing a unified
theory of comedy,

58
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,350
which will allow me to elicit
laughter from anyone at any time.

59
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,757
Unless they're German,
'cause that's a tough crowd.

60
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:01,069
Are you set on people
laughing with you?

61
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,919
'Cause if you're cool with at you...

62
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,711
I don't get it.

63
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,758
Raj, when you said you
were gonna bring a date

64
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,155
to watch Penny's thing tonight,
I didn't think you meant Stuart.

65
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,231
Really? I never for a second
thought it'd be anything else.

66
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,795
I almost met someone last night,
but I blew it.

67
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,912
l was walking Cinnamon
and this girl introduced herself,

68
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,714
but she was so cute I panicked
and said,

69
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,558
"Wouldn't it be easier
if instead of talking

70
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:36,397
we could just sniff
each other's butts?"

71
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,317
Well, Stuart's cute in his own way.

72
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,557
When I was a baby, my mother
called me her little possum.

73
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,195
-Are possums cute?
-Not at all.

74
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,073
If you're so intimidated
by talking to attractive girls,

75
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,840
maybe you should practice
by talking to regular people.

76
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,759
You mean like fatties and uggos?

77
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,071
Or maybe just stop talking.

78
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,319
I'm serious. Go to the mall,
talk to anybody, practice.

79
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,999
That way, when you eventually
do talk to a cute girl,

80
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,795
-it won't be so scary.
-Orjust keep dating the possum.

81
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,310
MAN ON TV: Parsa doesn't have
those kind of resources.

82
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,828
No, and that's why he had
Erin Pace rewire it...

83
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:19,949
I'm so proud of you.

84
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,798
We haven't even
gotten to my scene yet.

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,116
I know, but you're going to be a TV
star and you haven't left me yet.

86
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:25,911
That takes guts.

87
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,159
I don't know about you, but I'm
very uncomfortable with all this.

88
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,158
-Why?
-l've never seen this show before

89
00:05:33,359 --> 00:05:35,714
and now I'm starting
with episode 246?

90
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,756
lt's unnatural.

91
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,953
Just think of the first 245
as the prequel.

92
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,832
All right.

93
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,839
Okay, shh.
Guys, guys, this is it.

94
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,792
[guess it's you and me, kid.

95
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,116
-What are you doing?
-I'm trying to make peace.

96
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:55,388
-We're good.
-Good.

97
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,160
-Are you kidding me?
-What's wrong?

98
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:01,590
Well, the diner scene.
Where's my diner scene?

99
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,519
Don't ask me. Until I see
the prequel, I'm lost.

100
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,550
No, there was supposed to be
a big scene with me and Mark Harmon,

101
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,431
but it's... gone.

102
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,598
-What happened?
-They must've cut it.

103
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,030
Oh, Penny.

104
00:06:15,239 --> 00:06:17,116
l'm... I'm sorry.

105
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,719
-That stinks.
-l'm sure you were great.

106
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,388
This doesn't make any sense.
I mean, I...

107
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:23,555
I thought I did
a really good job, I...

108
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,433
Excuse me.

109
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,074
I've been studying how
to make people laugh.

110
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,630
They say that comedy
is tragedy plus time.

111
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,269
-Let's tickle some ribs.
-No!

112
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:52,348
No, Dad, I don't think they
cut me out of the show

113
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,630
because I was too pretty.

114
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:00,074
No, I don't need you to come out
and kick Mark Harmon's ass.

115
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,799
Daddy, I gotta go.
I love you. Bye.

116
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:08,877
-How you doing?
-(GROANS) This is such a disaster.

117
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,230
My parents had all my relatives over.

118
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:13,873
They got one of those
six-foot sandwiches,

119
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:16,991
and got my brother
a day pass out of rehab and...

120
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,750
...now he's missing
and the sandwich is missing, and...

121
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:26,077
They're probably in Mexico by now.
So humiliating.

122
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,510
You still got the part.
That's a huge accomplishment.

123
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,709
But this was supposed
to be my break, okay?

124
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:32,034
People were gonna
see me in this show

125
00:07:32,239 --> 00:07:33,194
and it was gonna
lead to bigger things.

126
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,073
More auditions, more parts.
Now none of that's gonna happen.

127
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,874
Honey, you only had three lines.
That wasn't gonna happen anyway.

128
00:07:43,119 --> 00:07:45,758
-Unbelievable.
-Oh, come on.

129
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,190
-That's not what I meant.
-Then what did you mean?

130
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,710
I don't-- You know, words don't
always have to mean things.

131
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,309
I think you meant
that you don't believe in me.

132
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:57,591
Nope. Uh-uh. I might not
know what I meant,

133
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,392
but I know that
I didn't mean that.

134
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,556
Not this guy. Oh, no way.

135
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,355
I want you, right now, to give me
your 100 percent honest opinion.

136
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,075
Do you think l have what it takes
to really make it as an actress?

137
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,759
-Yes.
-So you think I'll be on TV

138
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,392
and in movies and win awards.

139
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,033
-Honestly?
-Yes, honestly.

140
00:08:15,559 --> 00:08:18,869
-I don't.
-How could you say that?

141
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,878
I don't know-- I got all confused
when you said "honestly."

142
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,559
Oh!

143
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,710
Look, do I think
that you are talented

144
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,989
and that you are beautiful?
Of course I do.

145
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,236
But isn't Los Angeles
full of actresses

146
00:08:32,439 --> 00:08:35,715
who are just as talented,
just as beautiful?

147
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,070
Look, we'll come back to that.

148
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,713
No, please. Don't stop, go on.

149
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,036
Tell me how I'm gonna be a waitress
for the rest of my life.

150
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,755
That is not what I said.
Look, I think you're really good.

151
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,551
I truly do.

152
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,069
But this is an incredibly hard thing
that you're shooting for.

153
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,352
I mean, the odds of anyone
becoming a successful actor

154
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,109
-are like a million to one.
-Wow, thank you.

155
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,556
Should've let Sheldon come.

156
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,197
This is interesting.

157
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,709
Apparently, a key component
in some forms of humor

158
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,310
-is the element of surprise.
-Well, that makes sense.

159
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,715
The prefrontal cortex
is responsible

160
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,717
for planning and anticipation,

161
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,956
-and patients with brain lesions--
-Brain lesions!

162
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,869
Sheldon, you scared me.
That wasn't funny.

163
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:37,957
Or maybe you have a stick
up your prefrontal cortex.

164
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:43,076
Okay, the notion that you can
read a few books and come up

165
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,714
with a definitive theory
of comedy is absurd.

166
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,753
I mean, humor is
a complex neurological...

167
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,152
-Okay, that's pretty good.
-Excellent.

168
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,954
-How about her?
-No! No pretty girls!

169
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,798
The point is to talk
to regular people

170
00:10:09,999 --> 00:10:11,478
and work our way up
to pretty girls.

171
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,999
Fine.

172
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:16,837
How about that old lady
with the walker?

173
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,113
That depends. On any level,
do you think she's hot?

174
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,196
We'll find somebody else.

175
00:10:26,999 --> 00:10:28,637
Kumquat?

176
00:10:30,999 --> 00:10:32,478
I guess.

177
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,392
Ointment?

178
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,553
Sure.

179
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:42,794
Now, would you say ointment

180
00:10:42,999 --> 00:10:47,231
is more, equal to,
or less funny than kumquat?

181
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,192
I don't think I want
to go out with you anymore.

182
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,351
Would you please stop joking around?
I'm trying to figure this out.

183
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,154
Sheldon, how many words
are you gonna go through?

184
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,839
All of them.

185
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,477
You didn't get your part cut.

186
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,233
And you didn't get your part cut.

187
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,114
Yep, bunch of old guys
rocking out in a band,

188
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:17,516
all with erectile dysfunction,
you didn't get your part cut!

189
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,592
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

190
00:11:21,319 --> 00:11:23,116
Hey. Can we talk?

191
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,630
We can, but the part
of Penny might get cut.

192
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:30,756
That was really crappy of me.

193
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,071
What you're trying to do is hard,
but people do make it,

194
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,477
and I really do believe
you could be one of them.

195
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,148
Thank you.

196
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,955
And... to show you how much
I believe in you,

197
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,628
I kind of got you an audition.

198
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,319
Are you serious? For what?

199
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,476
-The new Star Wars movie.
-What?!

200
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,831
-How did you manage that?
-There's this thing online,

201
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,952
you put yourself on tape and just
send it in, anyone can do it.

202
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,110
Come on, Leonard,
this is just a PR stunt.

203
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,232
So? Even if it is,
you have a huge advantage

204
00:12:05,439 --> 00:12:06,872
because you're an actual actress.

205
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:09,593
Most of the people doing this
are just weirdoes and nerds.

206
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:14,028
Wolowitz sent his in two days ago.

207
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,873
-Really, let it go.
-Look, maybe it is a long shot,

208
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,036
but sometimes long shots happen.

209
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,516
Luke Skywalker was only given one
chance to destroy the Death Star.

210
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,075
He had to get a torpedo
into an exhaust port

211
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:29,555
that was only two meters wide,
but with the help of The Force, he--

212
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:32,637
Wow, I can feel you
hating me right now.

213
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,834
How about that lady
in the sweat suit, speed-walking?

214
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,395
Yeah, she seems friendly
and easy to...

215
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,237
Never mind, she's gone.

216
00:12:44,439 --> 00:12:47,715
Maybe talking
to people is too hard.

217
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:52,513
We could go over to that department
store, practice on the mannequins.

218
00:12:52,719 --> 00:12:54,437
I don't know.
They're dressed very stylishly.

219
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,550
They're probably stuck-up.

220
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,273
This is ridiculous.

221
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:04,438
The next person that walks by,
no matter who it is, they're the one.

222
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,278
We're gonna die here.

223
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,949
-Hello.
-Hey.

224
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,436
-Where's Sheldon?
-He's home trying to use science

225
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,232
to determine the basis of humor.

226
00:13:19,439 --> 00:13:21,350
-That's interesting.
-lt's exhausting.

227
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,993
Do you have any idea how hard it is

228
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,270
to laugh at a knock-knock
joke that starts with,

229
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,754
"Knock-knock-knock, Amy,
knock-knock-knock, Amy,

230
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,472
knock-knock-knock, Amy"?

231
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,669
If you want him to stop,

232
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:33,393
sometimes the easiest thing
to do is just fake a laugh.

233
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,591
Fake a laugh?

234
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:42,036
-Do you ever do that with me?
-No, of course not.

235
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,390
Well, I'd be able to tell anyway.

236
00:13:44,599 --> 00:13:46,669
I don't think you would.

237
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,030
Please, I've made
plenty of girls laugh,

238
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,356
sometimes just by
asking them out.

239
00:14:22,439 --> 00:14:24,748
Yeah? Well, | fake my orgasms.

240
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:31,794
Yes, how much for a hundred
long-stemmed, red roses?

241
00:14:31,999 --> 00:14:33,432
Really?

242
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:35,834
How much for three?

243
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,914
-Hey.
-Yeah, I'll call you back.

244
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,755
Look, I know you were
just trying to help

245
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,076
with your Star Wars thing.
I didn't mean to call it idiotic.

246
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,350
Well, I don't think
you called it idiotic.

247
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,120
Oh. Sorry, I meant to.

248
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:00,360
Anyway... I was just upset
with myself. I wasn't mad at you.

249
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,518
ljust feel like everything
is falling apart.

250
00:15:03,719 --> 00:15:06,074
-Come on. It's okay.
-No, it's not okay!

251
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,477
Look at me, okay? I took a temp job
as a waitress forever ago,

252
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,274
and I'm still doing it.
I can't quit, because guess what?

253
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,629
I can't do anything else.

254
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:18,118
And I finally get my big break,
and it goes away! I'm such a mess.

255
00:15:18,319 --> 00:15:19,718
-No, you're not.
-Really?

256
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,989
'Cause this morning at Starbucks,

257
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,158
a pair of old underwear
fell out of my pant leg!

258
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,788
And it wasn't the only
one in there.

259
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,796
Okay, listen to me,
this is just a minor setback.

260
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,434
No, it's not, okay? I've been out
here for, like, ten years!

261
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,871
-l've nothing to show for it!
-Well, you have me.

262
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,235
You're right.

263
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,229
I do have you.

264
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,595
Mmm.

265
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:50,597
Let's get married.

266
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,470
What?

267
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,392
Whoo.

268
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:03,355
Leonard Hofstadter,
will you marry me?

269
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,392
Um...

270
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,119
Did you seriously
just say, "Um"?

271
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:15,032
Look, you know! love you,

272
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,471
but you're... you're drunk
and sad and feeling lost--

273
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,194
Okay, so you don't
want to marry me?!

274
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,152
-That is not what I said.
-No, forget it! I take it back!

275
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,069
-Offer's off the table!
-Who's in the mood to laugh?!

276
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:30,468
Really not a good time.

277
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,114
But I used science
to construct the perfect joke.

278
00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:34,752
-l'm gonna go.
-Penny, don't.

279
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,837
No, no, ljust need to be alone.

280
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:44,833
So, a sandwich, a rabbi
and yo mama walk into a bar.

281
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,310
-Where are you going?
-To my room.

282
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,954
-Should I follow you?
-No.

283
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:52,275
-Leonard, wait.
-What?

284
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,358
| forgot to tell you
the sandwich is promiscuous.

285
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,198
How about those guys on that bench
over there? They look pathetic.

286
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,231
I bet we could talk to them.

287
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,317
That's a mirror.

288
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,471
Oh, yeah.

289
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,958
Hey, fellas, mall's closing.

290
00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:22,195
-Sorry.
-Yeah. Good night.

291
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:25,595
-Excuse me.
-Yeah?

292
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,435
Do you like being
a mall security guard?

293
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,236
-lt's all right.
-Okay, nice talking to you.

294
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,550
Smooth!

295
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,553
-Can't sleep?
-No.

296
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,396
Would you like to talk about it?

297
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,432
Penny proposed,
and I didn't say yes.

298
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:12,438
-Why not?
-That's a good question.

299
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:16,677
Does that mean the
relationship is over?

300
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:19,592
I don't know.

301
00:18:20,879 --> 00:18:21,994
Why don't you ask her?

302
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,837
Because I'm afraid
to know the answer.

303
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:35,714
Well... I'm sorry.

304
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:41,948
That's it? You're not
gonna make some dumb joke

305
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:43,831
or some inappropriate comment?

306
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,472
No.

307
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:50,638
You're my friend, and... I'm sorry.

308
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:58,917
Did you just put
a "kick me" sign on my back?

309
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,351
No.

310
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,676
That wouldn't be funny at all.

311
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,116

I felt his presence.

316
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,517
He's come for me.
He can feel when I'm near--
