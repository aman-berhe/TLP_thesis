PENNY:
Previously on The Big Bang Theory:

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,150
-This is just a minor setback.
-Nn, it's not, okay?

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:08,588
I've been out here for,
like, ten years.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,678
-l have nothing to show for it.
-Well, you have me.

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,199
I do have you.

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,753
Mmm.

7
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:23,237
Leonard Hofstadter,

8
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:24,918
will you marry me?

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,633
Urn...

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,115
Did you seriouslyjust say...umm?

11
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,711
-|t's an outrage.
-I know.

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,956
The university, they think
they can do whatever they want.

13
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:39,558
We just have to sit
there and take it.

14
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,829
You need to let it go, Sheldon.

15
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:43,553
You work tirelessly for someone
and this is what you get.

16
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,355
Oh, my God! They'rejust making
you use your vacation days!

17
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,233
But I don't want a vacation.

18
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,079
Okay, listen, I don't mean to
diminish what you're going through,

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,918
but I'm a little
distracted right now.

20
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,678
Oh, this again?

21
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,029
So, Penny proposed,
you didn't say yes,

22
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:01,150
and now you think you may
have lost her love forever.

23
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,955
How does this compare to me being
forced to relax for a few days?

24
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:09,154
-It doesn't!
-Thank you!

25
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,553
I'm gonna go talk to Penny.

26
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:15,751
I'm going to go inside,
put on my coziest pajamas,

27
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:19,315
curl up with a good book and wait
for this nightmare to be over.

28
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,638
(EXHALES)

29
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,832
Penny.

30
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,594
Sorry.

31
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:34,754
-Hi.
-Hey.

32
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,154
Look, I'm sorryl
didn't text you back.

33
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,588
ljust needed
some time to think.

34
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,711
-Okay.
-Here. Come in.

35
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,672
Look, if you want
to break up, just say it.

36
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:43,073
-Leonard--
-No, no, no. Make it back.

37
00:01:43,279 --> 00:01:45,076
Don't say it.
Just hate me, but stay with me.

38
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,872
It worked for my parents.

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,468
Listen, I don't want
to break up with you.

40
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:53,638
Oh. Okay.

41
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,708
Good, good.

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,956
So it's cool if I cry a little?

43
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:02,591
-Yeah, I probably wouldn't.
-Yeah.

44
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:07,599
Look, you did the right thing
last night. I was a mess.

45
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,835
I was just frustrated because
my career is going nowhere.

46
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,712
Look, | get it,
and I want you to know

47
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:14,274
that I support
whatever you want to do.

48
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,232
Great, because
I've been thinking,

49
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:17,667
if I really want this
acting thing to work,

50
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:20,439
I need to focus all my energy on it.
And to do that,

51
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,518
I should quit waitressing
at The Cheesecake Factory.

52
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,316
Wow.

53
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:27,237
-That's a big step.
-I know.

54
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,430
So, you know, before
making any rash--

55
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,517
-I already quit.
-And | support you.

56
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,794
: (THEME some) i

57
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,557
Come on, take me
to work with you.

58
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,478
No. You're on vacation.

59
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,989
Please? What if there's a big
breakthrough in science today

60
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,269
and I'm not there to see it?

61
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,629
Do you really think
there's gonna be a breakthrough

62
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,037
-without you there to do it?
-No. I was just tricking you.

63
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,672
Bye.

64
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:15,878
Leonard, wait!

65
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,911
-Take me with you.
-No!

66
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,039
-Please.
-No!

67
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,117
-Too bad. I'm coming with you.
-She|don, stay!

68
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,992
-But--
-I said stay!

69
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:32,837
I'm going to work.

70
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,234
Do not follow me.

BERNADETTE: Hey, Stuart.

74
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,591
-Hey.
-Sorry. Did I startle you?

75
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:00,950
Yes, but at this point, pretty
much any customer does.

76
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,195
-What can I do for you?
-Well, I need a little help.

77
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,834
I accidentally destroyed one of
Howard's comic books this morning,

78
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,474
-and was hoping I could replace it.
-Wow. What happened?

79
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,194
Batman got his ass kicked
by my curling iron.

80
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,276
Don't let The Riddler know that.

81
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,956
It's a comic book joke.

82
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,077
Or maybe it's not.

83
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,838
-Do you have this one?
-Well, it's pretty rare.

84
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:28,950
Can you give me a few
days to track it down?

85
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,879
I was kind of hoping to get it
before Howie comes home from work.

86
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,718
-What's the hurry?
-Well, he's always saying

87
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,796
I should be more careful
with my curling iron,

88
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,228
and it seems like
a dangerous precedent

89
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,510
to let him think he can be right.

90
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,792
Well, I'll do what I can,
but I can't make any promises.

91
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,309
You know, I do work
at a pharmaceutical company.

92
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:50,157
If you can make this happen today,

93
00:04:50,359 --> 00:04:53,715
I can hook you up with anxiety
medication, antidepressants.

94
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,239
Really.

95
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:58,195
Do you have any of these?

96
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,190
Hello, Mr. Rat Brain.

97
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,154

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,435
Hey, what brings you guys here?

100
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:14,958
Well, we were just on our way
to lunch and wanted to see

101
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,151
-if you'd like to join.
-Why?

102
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,679
Because Sheldon's
not here this week,

103
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:20,198
and you don't think I
have any other options?

104
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,958
I'm just kidding.
I'll get my purse.

105
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,675
Hi, Amy. I... on.

106
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:26,517
I'm sorry. I didn't know
you had any company.

107
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,109
That's okay.
Bert, this is Howard and Rajesh.

108
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:30,274
Guys, this is Bert.

109
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,390
-Hey. Good to see you.
-Hey.

110
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:33,032
Anyway, I wanted to show you

111
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,151
this tourmalinated quartz
that we got in the lab.

112
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:36,993
This is so pretty.

113
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,632
Bert works for the
geology department.

114
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:42,434
Yeah. You know what geologists
and Bon Jovi have in common?

115
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,878
You're both into rock?

116
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,437
Yeah.

117
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,390
-Well, see ya.
-You forgot your quartz.

118
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,628
Oh, it's okay.
I want you to have it.

119
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,034
Bye.

120
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:00,754
He's nice.

121
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,519
Yeah, he's nice
because he likes you.

122
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,994
What?

123
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,633
-No, he doesn't.
-He brought you a pretty rock.

124
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,876
So? He does that every day--
Oh.

125
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,395
You know, if you'd
rather skip lunch

126
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,830
and hang out with your boyfriend,
Bert, it's totally okay.

127
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,268
He's not my boyfriend.

128
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,118
Are you sure?
He's tall, pale and awkward.

129
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,470
That sounds like your type.

130
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:24,519
Should someone as lonely as you
really be making fun of me?

131
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,278
Yeah, grow up, Howard. God.

132
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,554
What do I do?
I don't want to hurt his feelings.

133
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,990
Maybe the problem is
he thinks you're available.

134
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,474
Does he know
you're dating Sheldon?

135
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,716
I guess it hasn't come up.

136
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,672
There you go.

137
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,235
And does Sheldon know
you're dating Sheldon?

138
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,478
I'm sorry. Who are you dating?

139
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,277
Yeah, knock it off, Howard!

140
00:06:57,359 --> 00:07:00,157
-Oh, hey, Sheldon.
-(DEJECTEDLY) Hello.

141
00:07:06,999 --> 00:07:08,478
You okay?

142
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:11,193
I'm on vacation.
What do you think?

143
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,199
Why are you sitting
in the stairwell?

144
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:17,196
Leonard told me to stay.

145
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,554
Oh.

146
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,716
Well, good boy.

147
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:24,830
-Where are you going?
-I have a ton of errands to run.

148
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,951
I need to make copies of my
headshot, send them off to agents

149
00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:28,797
and sign up for a new
acting class.

150
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,833
-Well, have fun.
-Okay.

(WHIMPERS SOFTLY)

00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:40,315
-You want to come with me?
-Really?

153
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,635
Come on, boy. Come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

154
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,318
Get in the car. Come on.

155
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,750
All right, thanks a lot.

156
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,953
They have one at Capital Comics.

157
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,630
-That's great.
-No, it's not. I hate that place.

Guy who owns it is ajerk.

159
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,478
He's always making me
feel bad about myself.

160
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,557
That's terrible.

161
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,878
What's the address?

162
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,309
You know, why don't I
just take you there?

163
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,998
That way, I can make sure
he doesn't rip you off.

164
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,918
Thanks, but I don't
want you to close up.

165
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,031
I mean, won't you lose business?

166
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,676
Sorry. That was mean.

167
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,399
Penny really quit
The Cheesecake Factory?

168
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,511
-Yeah.
-So what is she doing today?

169
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:25,710
I don't know. She already
thinks I don't support this,

170
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,194
so if I call, it might look like
I'm checking up on her.

171
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:30,390
-Well, do you support this?
-Of course I do.

172
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:33,636
She's a great actress.
I'm proud she's taking this risk.

173
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,116
-That's nice.
-You bought that? Great!

174
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,989
I got to call her before
I forget how I said it.

175
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,710
Hey.

176
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,592
-Hi. What's up?
-How's it going?

177
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,994
You taking Hollywood by storm?

178
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,428
Actually,
I'm at The Cheesecake Factory.

179
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:51,834
You got yourjob back.
That is great news.

180
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,793
I didn't want to say anything,
but you are making the right choice.

181
00:08:54,999 --> 00:08:57,638
To plunge yourself into debt right
now would be literally insane.

182
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,229
Yeah. I'm just
returning my uniform.

183
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:04,835
And | support you.

184
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,475
MAN: Before we begin your
guided meditation,

185
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,070
close your eyes and picture
yourself in a peaceful environment.

186
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:19,232
Okay.

187
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:24,035
|'m inside the CERN super collider.

188
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,518
Now, take a deep, relaxing
breath in through your nose.

189
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,512
And let it out.

190
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,676
Wow. Didn't see that coming.

191
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,629
In.

192
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,669
Let me guess.

193
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:42,437
And out.

194
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,750
What was I gonna do?
Two "ins" in a row?

195
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,148
(CAR DOOR OPENS)

196
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,994
-Where's my lemonade?
-I didn't get it.

197
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,033
Afitting swan song
to your career as a waitress

198
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,754
to forget my order one last time.

199
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:07,074
Do you think quitting
myjob was a mistake?

200
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,956
Do you see me drinking lemonade?

201
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:12,353
No. I'm serious.

202
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,599
Why do you ask?

203
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,189
Because Leonard just pissed me off.

204
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,752
Am I being an idiot or not?

205
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,110
No, I don't think you are.

206
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,594
Really?

207
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,918
The best way to achieve
a goal is to devote 100 percent

208
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,951
of your time and energy to it.

209
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,559
When I decided |was
going to be a physicist,

210
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,831
I didn't take some otherjob
in case it didn't work out.

211
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,917
Which wasn't easy because
there was a lot of pressure

212
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,839
from Ms. Pierson for me
to be chalk monitor that year.

213
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,797
Thank you.
I needed to hear that.

214
00:10:41,999 --> 00:10:43,717
Why can't Leonard understand it?

215
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,309
Because he's not like us, Penny.

216
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,991
We're dreamers.

217
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,751
Yeah, I need to start cracking the
window when I leave you in the car.

218
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:02,755
Hey.

219
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,188
Hello, Bert.

220
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,038
So, anyway, there's this big
rock and mineral show

221
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,878
next week in Santa Monica and--

222
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:12,515
Listen... Bert, before you
say anything else, I...

223
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,713
I have a boyfriend.

224
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,633
Oh. This is awkward.

225
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,593
You thought I was gonna ask you
to go with me to the mineral show.

226
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,869
Weren't you?

227
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:24,512
Yeah.

228
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,595
That's very nice of you,
but I do have a boyfriend.

229
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,119
That's what you all say.

230
00:11:32,319 --> 00:11:33,229
You just don't want
to go out with me

231
00:11:33,439 --> 00:11:35,316
because I have
an off-putting personality.

232
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:36,998
No, that's not true.

233
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:39,076
My boyfriend has
an off-putting personality, too.

234
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,350
Way worse than you.

235
00:11:43,439 --> 00:11:45,475
Don't worry. I'm used to it.

236
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,433
I mean, I'm big and weird
and funny-looking

237
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,200
and no one ever wants
to do anything with me.

238
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,472
Don't say that.

239
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,718
It's okay.
I know I'm a monster.

240
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,070
No, Bert, come on.

241
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,632
I'd love to go to the
mineral show with you.

242
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,353
Sweet. It's a date.

243
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,794
-No, it's not.
-BERT: Too late!

244
00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:14,714
J“ (ALTERNATIVE MUSIC PLAYS) J“

245
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,590
Wow.

246
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,430
Yeah. Haven't seen this
many people in my store

247
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:26,915
since that Korean church bus
crashed through my front window.

248
00:12:27,999 --> 00:12:30,467
-Hey! Stuart!
-Jesse.

249
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,638
Haven't seen you in forever.
Look how gray you've gotten.

250
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,034
My hair's exactly
the same color as always.

251
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,196
No, I was talking about your skin.

252
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:41,555
Look... my friend here
needs a comic book--

253
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,870
Ooh! And she went into
your store by mistake.

254
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,516
Good thing there was no
one there to see you.

255
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,468
What do you need?

256
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,958
Oh, yeah, yeah. I got this.
Right over here.

257
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,037
Even you, Sweatpants?

258
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,878
Free popcorn.

259
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,078
Can I offer you a coffee?

260
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,475
-Espresso? Latte?
-No, than ks.

261
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,352
How about you, Stu?
Mocha? Scone?

262
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,710
Directions to the
nearest soup kitchen?

263
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:10,272
-Hey.
-I'm just kidding.

264
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,516
He knows where the soup kitchen is.

265
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,393
It's on Merton Avenue.

266
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,110
I don't think I like the way
you're treating my friend.

267
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,673
Sorry.

268
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:23,949
-You want the book or not?
-Not from you.

269
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,113
Let's go, Stuart.

270
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,071
You know something, Jesse?

271
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,998
You may have a
successful business

272
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,351
and the kind of pink complexion
that comes with good nutrition...

273
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,717
but I have something
more important.

274
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,992
-What's that?
-Friendship.

275
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,799
Which I would trade in a
heartbeat for all of this.

276
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,956
The mineral and rock show?

277
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,720
That would be awful even
without Bert.

278
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,717
So what am I supposed to do now?

279
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,992
Prepare your uterus
for his gigantic offspring?

280
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,758
This isn't funny.

281
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,154
I'm gonna have to
tell him the truth:

282
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,634
that even if I didn't
have a boyfriend,

283
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,239
Iwouldn't be interested in him.

284
00:14:11,439 --> 00:14:13,316
I've heard those
words so many times.

285
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,511
From Linda Nosenchuck,
Tammy Rosenworcel...

286
00:14:15,719 --> 00:14:16,993
Padma Kapur, Neha Chowdury...

287
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,918
Marci Grossman,
Lisa Mazzarino...

288
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,519
-Megan Pincus...
-Tammy Cho...

289
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,948
Who was that girl
from our Starbucks?

290
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,230
-Arlene Russell!
-Yes! Arlene!

291
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,232
She wrote "no way"
on both our cappuccinos.

292
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,074
Poor Bert.

293
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,315
That guy's got a rough
afternoon ahead of him.

294
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,955
Well, how would you want a girl
to tell you she wasn't interested?

295
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:41,914
I guess, uh, I'd like her to sit me
down, look me in the eye and say,

296
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,475
"I was wrong. I love you."

297
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,752
And then maybe she could
touch me in a special way.

298
00:14:49,479 --> 00:14:51,390
That's how you reject a guy.

299
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,195
Okay, I don't have time for this.

300
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:55,708
I'm just gonna go find him
and be brutally honest.

301
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,148
-No, don't.
-He'|| be so upset.

302
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,032
He'll probably climb
up the Empire State Building

303
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,151
and start swatting at planes.

304
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:07,153
You want us to talk to him?

305
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,271
Really? You would do that?

306
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,072
Sure. We've both been in his shoes.

307
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,474
We'll let him down with
compassion and respect.

308
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,469
-Thank you.
-Let's go.

309
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,870
So we tell him
she's a lesbian, right?

310
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,956
Of course we tell him
she's a lesbian.

311
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,235
And hold three...

312
00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:34,714
two... one.

313
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,830
Very good.

314
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,435
Now let's try Warrior II.

315
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:42,318
And hold.

316
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,671
I've read that there are great
yogis who have such mastery

317
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,589
over their bodies they can draw
water in through their genitals.

318
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,559
Yeah, well, I don't think we're
gonna get to do that today.

319
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,559
Too bad.

320
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:08,477
It seems like a good way
to drink a milk shake

321
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:10,590
without getting brain freeze.

322
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,439
Oh, hey.

323
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,198
And now we go to Reverse Warrior.

324
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,399
How did she get you to do yoga?

325
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:27,150
Well, to be honest,
I thought she said "Yoda."

326
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:34,028
I'm helping him relax because,
unlike you, he supports me.

327
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,510
Oh, How many times
do I have to say it?

328
00:16:36,719 --> 00:16:38,914
-I support you.
-She|don, take a break.

329
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,998
Namaste .

330
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,869
Okay, if you support me,
what was with that phone call?

331
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,547
Fine. I'm not sure
you should have quit.

332
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:50,112
But if you care so
much what I think,

333
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:51,672
why didn't you ask me
before you did it?

334
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,108
Oh, so now! need
your permission?

335
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,072
Would you have asked me
before you quit yourjob?

336
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,634
Yes. I thought we were
in the kind of relationship

337
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,397
where we make decisions together.

338
00:16:59,599 --> 00:17:00,873
If I'm wrong,
then maybe we need to talk

339
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:02,592
about the kind of relationship
we're actually in.

340
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,028
Yeah, well, maybe we do.

341
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,958
I'm willing to if you guys are.

342
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,989
Can we please
have some privacy?

343
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,428
No.

344
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,358
I'm as much a part of this
relationship as you two,

345
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,028
and I think it's high time we
put all our cards on the table.

346
00:17:15,239 --> 00:17:17,230
Yeah. For example,
where is this going?

347
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,158
Are you two ever getting married?

348
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,715
And, if so, where will we all live?
Have you thought about that?

349
00:17:24,239 --> 00:17:25,467
-No.
-Penny?

350
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:26,907
OK, wait. What are we doing?

351
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,678
For some reason,
we're planning a future

352
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,871
where we both live
with Sheldon forever.

353
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,911
Good. Now we're getting somewhere.

354
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:36,714
Look, I know you think I'm being
reckless, and you might be right,

355
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:38,238
but I need to take this shot.

356
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,274
No kidding. Despite what it says
on her résumé, she is no longer 22.

357
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:48,429
I swear, I am on your side.

358
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,359
You keep saying you're on my
side, but you don't act like it.

359
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,790
He does that to me, too.
Why do we put up with it?

360
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,956
Listen, I could never do
what you're doing, okay?

361
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:01,548
-I would be terrified.
-Well, it's scary for me, too.

362
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,478
I'm fine with it.

363
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,673
My point is, just because I couldn't
do it doesn't mean you shouldn't.

364
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,154
And I'm proud of you.

365
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:15,547
Okay. Thank you.

366
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,792
Well, to celebrate
this reconciliation,

367
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,433
let's all share a milk shake.

368
00:18:19,639 --> 00:18:22,028
Penny, you'll need a straw.

369
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,639
-You're back.
-Yes, I am!

370
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,193
There's a few more things
I want to say to you.

371
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,233
Stuart's store is just fine, and he's
a much nicer person than you are,

372
00:18:34,439 --> 00:18:36,873
and if you still have that comic,
I'd like to buy it right now!

373
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,349
No problem.

374
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:41,789
Oh, you want a latte
while you wait?

375
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,718
No, I don't want a latte!

376
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,514
I want a cappuccino
and a blueberry scone!

377
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:50,828
-I only have chocolate chip.
-Well, that sounds even better!

378
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,633
Thanks for coming to the
mineral and rock show with me.

379
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,949
We're sorry Amy didn't want to go.

380
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,799
Really, really sorry.

381
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:12,632
Nah, who needs her
when I have you guys?

382
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,196
CHANTING: Rock show!
Rock show! Rock show!

383
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:18,397

384

Rock show!
