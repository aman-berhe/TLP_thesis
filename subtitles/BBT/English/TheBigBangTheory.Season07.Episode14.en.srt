00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:10,072
T-minus 60 seconds!

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,952
It all comes down to this!

3
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:14,153
I've got butterflies.

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,952
Don't get soft on me, Hofstadter.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,037
I will slap those glasses
right off your face.

6
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,830
What's going on?

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,871
Hey. We're about
to buy tickets for Comic-Con.

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,234
T-minus 45 seconds!

9
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:29,669
They sell out incredibly fast,
but as long as one of us gets in....

10
00:00:29,879 --> 00:00:32,154
Good Lord, this is not the time
for flirting! Keep it in your pants!

11
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:36,189
It's a whole lot
of weird before coffee.

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,668
(LOUDLY) T-minus 30 seconds!

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,110
Oh, I have to go
to the bathroom so bad.

14
00:00:41,319 --> 00:00:43,150
Every year!
I told you, wear a diaper!

15
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:44,758
And I told you | get diaper rash!

16
00:00:44,959 --> 00:00:46,028
15 seconds!

17
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,435
Oh, this is it!

18
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,716
(INHALES)

19
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,679
This is it.

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,556
Five, four, three,

21
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,954
two, one.

22
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,479
lt's live. Go! Go! Go!

23
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:06,349
Anyone in?

24
00:01:06,559 --> 00:01:07,833
-No!
-Not yet!

25
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,838
Do not stop refreshing your screens!

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,598
-Refresh.
-Refresh.

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,351

gonna be enough coffee.

00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,878

34
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,559
I did it! I did it!
I'm in the queue!

36
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,039
And they say firefighters
are the real heroes.

37
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,838
What number in line are you?

38
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,155
-Fifteen...
-G reat!

-...thousand, 211.
-Damn!

40
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,950
They only have Thursday
and Sunday passes left.

41
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,230
-Really?
-Thursday's gone. Just Sunday left.

42
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,158
Sunday's the worst!

43
00:02:21,359 --> 00:02:24,032
Everybody's leaving,
most of the good panels are over,

44
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,549
and the only T-shirts
they have left are small and XXXXL.

45
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,153
-Sunday's gone.
-Not Sunday! I love Sunday!

46
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:38,029
So that's it?
Everything's sold out?

47
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,189
Yeah.

48
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:43,350
I can't believe we're not going.

49
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,628
It's okay

50
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,715
There-there's always WonderCon
in Anaheim.

51
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,113
That's just as good.

52
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,838
(WEAKLY) Excuse me.

53
00:02:57,279 --> 00:02:58,553
(5035)

54
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,434
Guys, this is really sad.

55
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:06,547
And in a different way
than it was 20 minutes ago.

56
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,472
I can't believe we wasted all
that time on our Hulk costumes.

57
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,511
What? You were all going as the Hulk?

58
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,869
Not the same Hulk.

59
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,072
Ferrigno, Bana, Norton and Ruffalo.

60
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,718
We would have been the angry green
belles of the masquerade ball.

61
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,439
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

62
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,036
And we're back
to the first kind of sad.

63
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,312
Gentlemen, I have the solution
to our Comic-Con problem.

64
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,919
We don't need them.

65
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,076
I'm starting my own convention.

66
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:45,634
Sheldon, just buy
scalped tickets with us.

67
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,150
I told you. Buying scalped
tickets is against the rules.

68
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:52,476
If you get caught, you get
banned from Comic-Con for life.

69
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,954
Life, Leonard.

70
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,150
You're gonna feel pretty silly
when we're so years old,

71
00:03:56,359 --> 00:03:57,508
and you have to drive me down there

72
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:59,357
and then wait in the car
for three days.

73
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,157
Do what you want.
We're getting scalped tickets.

74
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:05,634
I already found a guy online
who's willing to sell.

75
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,751
How do you know
this isn't a sting operation

76
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,837
set up by the Comic-Con police?

77
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,152
The same way I know that the people
in the TV set can't see me.

78
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,669
Sheldon, just come with us.

79
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:18,835
You're not gonna make
your own convention.

80
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:21,951
You know, there was a time
when Comic-Con didn't exist at all

81
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,550
until one lone dreamer
with a unique vision made it happen.

82
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,478
And you mark my words,
I'm gonna rip that guy off.

83
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,151
Yes, I'm starting
my own comic book convention,

84
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:38,112
and I thought that your client,
Robert Downey Jr.,

85
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,028
would be perfect to appear
on our first panel.

86
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:45,553
Well, now, why are you saying "no"?
You haven't even asked him yet.

87
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:48,995
You know, excuse me,
but I sat through Iron Man 2.

88
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,395
I believe he owes me
two hours of his time.

89
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,879
They hung up on me.

90
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,158
Did you tell them that you're
holding your convention at

91
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,312
a Marie Callender's, and that every
panelist gets a free slice of pie?

92
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,032
I didn't even get to that part.

93
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,839
Look, even your friend Wil Wheaton
thinks this is a waste of time.

94
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,190
Not true.
Wil thinks this is a great idea.

95
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:16,993
He was just concerned that
he wasn't a big enough celebrity

96
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,155
to headline such an amazing event.

97
00:05:19,359 --> 00:05:21,953
Also, that's the same day
that he shampoos his beard.

98
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:26,752
Sheldon, I just don't think this
is going to come together for you.

99
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,187
You don't know that.

100
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:30,867
I still have plenty
of solid leads on this list.

101
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,308
-Good luck.
-No, wait.

102
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,829
I need you to call Stan Lee,
Leonard Nimoy

103
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,677
and Bill Nye the Science Guy.

104
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,637
'Cause, legally, I'm not allowed to.

105
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,517
Oh, and, also,
Carrie Fisher, you know,

106
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,517
'cause I hear she can be pretty nuts.

107
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,111
I can't believe Leonard
is spending hundreds of dollars

108
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:50,547
on scalped tickets.

109
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,909
Last week, you spent
that on a little dress.

110
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,590
Yeah, but those tickets
only get him into Comic-Con.

111
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:57,790
That dress gets me
into anywhere I want.

112
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,871
Those tickets were pretty expensive.

113
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:04,388
I had to give Howie an advance
on his allowance.

114
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,476
Now he's never gonna
put his toys away.

115
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:11,232
Why can't they do something sensible

116
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,795
like Sheldon and start their
own comic book convention?

117
00:06:15,239 --> 00:06:17,628
Also, who wants
to throw me out that window?

118
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,278
While they're acting like teenagers,
we could do something grown-up.

119
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,072
Oh. You mean like a museum?

120
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:26,747
Yes, like a museum,
but anything else.

121
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,278
I know. There's a nice hotel
not far from here

122
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,913
where they do afternoon tea.

123
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,350
Afternoon tea,
how sophisticated of us.

124
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,754
All right, if we're gonna be fancy,

125
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,076
I should probably put on
clean underwear.

126
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,116
La-dee-da!
Look who has clean underwear.

127
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,799
No, we're gonna stop at Target
on the way.

128
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:49,078
Since Sheldon's
not going to Comic-Con,

129
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,510
maybe we could find a cool trio
to dress up as.

130
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:54,429
What if we go as The Fantastic Four,
and just tell people

131
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,516
that The Invisible Girl
is standing there with us.

132
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,559
Oh, and I thought our days
of pretending

133
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,113
to be with women
who don't exist were over.

(CHUCKLES)

135
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:05,188
Gentlemen, I am one step away

136
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:08,516
from securing a huge guest
for my convention.

137
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:11,313
Does that step include chloroform
and a roll of duct tape?

138
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,472
I don't think that will be necessary
for Mr. James Earl Jones.

139
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:18,034
You heard me.
The voice of Darth Vader,

140
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,719
the Lion King's dad,

141
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,150
and FYI, the guy who says,
"This is CNN."

142
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,876
Which also sounds like Darth Vader.

143
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,549
How are you gonna get
James Earl Jones?

144
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,911
Simple. Earlier today, he Tweeted
that he's looking forward

145
00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:37,508
to going to his favorite
sushi restaurant for dinner.

146
00:07:37,719 --> 00:07:39,949
I Googled an interview
from four years ago

147
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,152
which was conducted in
his favorite sushi restaurant.

148
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:46,556
That's where he'll be,
and that's where I'm going, and--

149
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,320
And that's where Darth Vader's gonna
pour soy sauce on your head.

150
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,795
Sheldon, I don't care if you get
scalped tickets with us or not,

151
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:56,672
but please don't be creepy
and go stalking this poor guy.

152
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,358
You're gonna get in trouble.

153
00:07:58,559 --> 00:08:00,390
You're the ones
who are going to get in trouble.

154
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,477
You're buying
non-transferable tickets.

155
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,671
And from a stranger, no less.

156
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,757
Not only can you get
banned from Comic-Con,

157
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,520
if caught, you could be charged
with petty theft.

158
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:12,108
You think about that while
I'm warning James Earl Jones

159
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,628
about the danger of posting
his location on Twitter.

160
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,672
He got lucky this time.
There are some weirdoes out there.

Our friendly neighborhood scalper
says he's running late.

166
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,719
Does he sound like a criminal?

167
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,675
What do you mean?

168
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:55,999
You know, did he say things like,
"Youse guys," or "Listen here, see?"

169
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,032
Yes. He's late because
he's on his way here from 1940.

170
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:05,751
I'm just saying.
We don't know who this guy is.

00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,791
What if he wants to steal
our money or our kidneys,

172
00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:09,910
or make a suit out of our skins?

173
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,878
Why would someone want to make
clothes out of your skin?

174
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,117
I don't know. Maybe 'cause
dark doesn't show the stains?

175
00:09:19,439 --> 00:09:20,997
Now you're making me wonder
if we should have met him

176
00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:22,268
at a neutral location.

177
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,516
Why do you think I told him
to come to your place?

178
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,558
There sure are a lot
of little kids here.

179
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:37,875
I can't believe we thought this
would makes us feel grown up.

180
00:09:38,199 --> 00:09:40,349
I can't believe the waiter
thought I was your daughter.

181
00:09:43,439 --> 00:09:46,272
Last time I got dressed up
and had tea was when I was five.

182
00:09:46,479 --> 00:09:49,073
Just me, my teddy bear,
Raggedy Ann and my hamster.

183
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,838
-That's cute.
-It was.

184
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,350
Until my hamster ate all her babies.

185
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,750
It got less cute really fast.

186
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,830
-Should we leave?
-There's a bar in the lobby.

187
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,275
I could go for a drink.

188
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,200
Aw. Drinking in the afternoon,
just like her mommy.

189

191

You know, I've been in other movies.

192
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,509

about those, do you?

193

to people like you....

194

202

203
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,631
where he says he got caught
using someone else's badge,

204
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,148
and Sheldon was right,
he did get charged with petty theft.

205

dressed as the Human Torch,

206

we changed our minds.

not going to Comic-Con.

-Do what?
-Chicken out.

214

We're so afraid
of getting into trouble

215
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,759

-A little.
-Yeah, me, too.

Empire Strikes Back

and Darth Vader told Luke
he was his father,

235
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,712

But he wasn't, was he?

Not gonna lie, it felt good.

247
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,474
Let me ask you a question:

248
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,159
When did you guys
start feeling grown up?

249
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,634
'Cause I am not sure I do.

250
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,357
Honestly, I thought when
I got married I would,

251
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,551
but I still kind of feel
like I'm pretending.

252
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,673
It doesn't help that most of
my clothes come from Gap Kids.

253

Okay, so I'm an adult,

254
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:40,514
and the other day I saw
an old man slip and fall down,

255
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,551
and I laughed.

256
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,872

he would've heard me.

-Oh, my gosh.
-I know.

260
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,158

came off his walker

261
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,033

even been with a man.

267

when I apply for citizenship?

to disclose something like this

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,196
And San Diego is
right across the border

343
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,188
from my favorite city on Earth,
Tijuana...

344
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:36,150
...where I'm taking you
every night!

345
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,828
Ay-ay-ay.

346
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,157
Ay-ay-ay, bang-bang.

347
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:52,272
So, Beau Bridges
is on my shoulders,

348
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,677
and Jeff Bridges is
on Marlon Brando's shoulders,

349
00:18:55,879 --> 00:18:59,076
and remember, we do not have
permission to be in the pool.

350
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:01,190
Hey! Sheldon, wake up!

351
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,874
Angie Dickinson is about to
sic the dogs on us,

352
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:07,388
and I go under the water and
Marion goes under the water,

353
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,158
and the water raises
about two feet

354
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,554
and sloshes all over her patio,

355
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,512
and the dogs freak out
and run like hell,

356
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:14,118
then we run like hell....

357
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,868
Oh, boy!

358
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,752
That was a lot of fun.

359
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:21,797
Who's Angie Dickinson?

360
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,112
