1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,272
Item 28: your pet name for me.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,590
Time's running out on this.
You need to make a decision.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,870
I submitted you a notarized list.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,358
I'm sorry, but "Gollum"
and "Flakey" are not acceptable.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,076
Well, you don't like
"Princess Corncob"

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,272
you don't like "Fester,"
you're just impossible to please.

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,799
We'll come back to that one.

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,355
This brings us to the final item

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,710
in our annual
State of the Relationship summit.

10
00:00:26,919 --> 00:00:29,433
Item 29: Valentine's Day.

11
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,477
Ohh! The worst for last.

12
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:35,237
Classic Flakey.

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,918
Before you get upset,

14
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,758
I believe I've come up with
a way for us to celebrate

15
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:41,438
the occasion that we both can enjoy.

16
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,915
People usually start
a meeting with ajoke,

17
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,190
but you go ahead, end with one.

18
00:00:47,319 --> 00:00:49,275
I propose we spend a weekend

19
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:51,151
at a bed-and-breakfast
in Napa Valley.

20
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,749
I hate every word in that sentence.

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,079
Including "in" "at," "we" and "a."

22
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,558
Come on, Sheldon. Why not?

23
00:01:00,759 --> 00:01:03,148
For starters,
a bed-and-breakfast forces you

24
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,158
-to eat with strangers at your table.
-One step ahead of you.

25
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,952
Bernadette and Wolowitz
are going with us.

26
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:10,390
Very well. What are
the sleeping arrangements?

27
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,989
We've only been dating
for three years.

28
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,839
If we were to share a room,
people might talk.

29
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,269
I got you your own room.

30
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,198
What if my room has
a claw-foot bathtub?

31
00:01:20,399 --> 00:01:23,072
It doesn't. I know it makes you feel
like you're bathing inside a monster.

32
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:28,035
Look, I appreciate the effort,
but I'm still unclear

33
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:31,231
how this trip is supposed
to be enjoyable for me.

34
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,191
We're going to have
Valentine's Day dinner

35
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:36,835
on a fully functioning vintage train.

36
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:39,553
Vintage? Be specific.

37
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,796
An Alcoa FA-4
diesel locomotive

38
00:01:41,999 --> 00:01:44,115
leading a train
of meticulously restored

39
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,675
1915 Pullman first-class coaches.

40
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:48,672
Wow.

41
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,838
I'm feeling the urge to hug you.

42
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:55,394
And one... and two...

43
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,273
All right, Gollum, we're good.

44
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,318
: (THEME some) I

45
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,992
Are you sure you guys don't
want to come with us to Napa?

46
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,315
You could probably still get a room.

47
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,795
No, I think we're just gonna
have a quiet weekend at home.

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,274
Plus, I'm not sure it's a great idea

49
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,630
to take Penny
to where wine comes from.

50
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,589
What? It's ajoke.

51
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,916
Oh, come on.
We bust on each other.

52
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,111
I wear dorky glasses,
you might have a problem.

53
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,911
It's all for laughs.

54
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,992
That would really piss me off if
I didn't have a buzz going on.

55
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,837
Howard, which pocket watch will you
be wearing for dinner on the train?

56
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,629
I'm sorry, what?

57
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,676
I'm afraid if we wear
the same pocket watch,

58
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,358
it will be embarrassing.

59
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:10,149
I don't own a pocket watch.

60
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:12,557
Oh, my.

61
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,196
Well, then my apologies
for bringing up this sore spot.

62
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,472
Since you two are gonna be
around for Valentine's,

63
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,715
would you mind
watching Cinnamon?

64
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,876
You have Valentine's plans?

65
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,674
Which came out sounding way
more surprised than I meant.

66
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:30,432
Let me try that again.
You have Val--

67
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,234
-See? I can't do it.
-I don't have plans,

68
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,113
which is whyl booked time
on the big telescope that night.

69
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,118
Well, an evening looking at the
stars, that's still kind of romantic.

70
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,469
Except I'll be alone.

71
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,194
I'm trying to put lipstick
on a pig here. Work with me.

72
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,553
-We'd be happy to watch Cinnamon.
-Yeah.

73
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,478
Thank you. Oh, and I'd like
for at least one of us

74
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,477
to see some action, so if you
guys happen to have sex,

75
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,318
it's cool if she stays in the room.

76
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:56,749
Same goes for the
two of you with Amy.

77
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,997
What do you think, Sheldon?

78
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,952
lt's magnificent.

79
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,355
This is going to be
the best Valentine's Day ever.

80
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:17,151
I'm so glad you like it.

81
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:18,917
I'm prepared to say I love it,

82
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,634
as soon as I confirm there
are no hobos aboard.

83
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,791
OK.

84
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,631
Raj, I got it.

85
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,273
Bye.

86
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,676
That was your daddy.

87
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,070
He wanted me to say that he misses--
Why am I doing this?

88
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:42,271
Happy Valentine's Day!

89
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,516
Flowers and chocolates?

90
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,075
Somebody's trying
to get me out of my panties.

91
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,475
Don't be surprised if you
find five chocolates missing

92
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,591
and three gross coconut
ones with a bite taken out.

93
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:56,156
It came that way when I bought it.

94
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,351
Got you a little something, too.

95
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,755
Oh, jewelry!

96
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,274
Oh, my God. Lakers tickets?!

97
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,438
It gets better. Instead of me,
you can take someone

98
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,914
-who will actually enjoy it.
-Ohh!

99
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,470
You are the best boyfriend ever.

100
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,274
Thank you. Seriously,
please don't make me go.

101
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,358
Should we take this little
party to the bedroom?

102
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:23,515
Don't have to. We have
the whole place to ourselves.

103
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,995
-That's true.
-In fact, if you want,

104
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:28,508
we can do it right here
on Sheldon's spot.

105
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,029
That is the least sexy thing
anyone's ever said to me.

106
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:36,996
-To the bedroom!
-Yeah!

107
00:05:41,959 --> 00:05:44,837
And for the entrÃ©e, tonight's
special is a seafood risotto.

108
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,190
-Do you have any questions?
-I do.

109
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,075
Does this train car have
the original Iink-and-pin coupler

110
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,157
or the Miller Hook and platform?

111
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,112
I'm sorry, I meant
questions about the food.

112
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,912
Oh, of course.

113
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,918
Is the seafood risotto being
served on a train car

114
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:02,393
with the original
Iink-and-pin coupler

115
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:04,112
or the Miller Hook and platform?

116
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,718
lthink we're gonna
need a minute.

117
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,070
Fun fact: it's neither.

118
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:16,830
They actually use
the AAR type "E" coupler.

119
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,235
If you listen carefully when
the locomotive disconnects,

120
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,874
you'll hear the characteristic
click, whoosh,

121
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,758
...thunk of the knuckle.

122
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:28,191
Get out of town.

123
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,634
Fun fact: I'm gonna
jump off this train.

124
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,197
Hey, Cinnamon,
guess who just did it human style.

125
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:43,912
Oh, my God!

126
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,473
It's a little late, but I'll take it.

127
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:49,877
No, Cinnamon ate the chocolates.
That's really bad for dogs.

128
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,957
Oh, crap.
What are we gonna do?

129
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,478
We gotta get her to a vet right now.

130
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:55,715
I don't have a vet.
I have a podiatrist,

131
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,752
an optometrist, an allergist,
a dermatologist, a urologist.

132
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,518
You'd think I'd have a vet.

133
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,315
OK. There's one not far from here.

134
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:03,554
-Come on. Let's go.
-OK.

135
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,399
Koothrappali was right.
We should have let her watch.

136
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:12,313
Do another one, do another one!

137
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,750
OK. Here's my impression
of the Amtrak Acela

138
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,029
barreling down the Eastern Corridor.

Oh, yeah. I've got one.

I've been on that train.
And Ijust was again.

Bang! Splat! Thud.

How many trains
have you been on?

149
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:59,229
Tons. A box fell on my
head at UPS six years ago.

150
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,874
Now I just collect disability
and ride trains.

151
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,597
Wow. Your life's amazing.

152
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:11,069
Not always. A box fell on my
head at UPS six years ago.

Now I just collect disability
and ride trains.

-Why do I even try?
-I'm gonna fix this right now.

155
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,635
OK. Just make it
look like an accident.

156
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,229
Excuse me. You are at Valentine's
dinner with your girlfriend.

157
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:34,192
Now get back over there
and be with her.

158
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,793
You're right.
That was insensitive of me.

159
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,557
I have to go back to my table now.

160
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:42,431
-You should join us.
-All right.

161
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,757
Great. Now there's two of 'em.

162
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,390
-How much chocolate did she eat?
-A whole box.

163
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,478
Well, to be fair, you ate a lot of it
before you gave it to me.

164
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,598
So the point is I may
have saved her life.

165
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,751
I'm sorry, is this ajoke to you?

166
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,313
No.

167
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,913
Maybe to her.

Something like this. I don't know.

those Lakers tickets were?

00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:22,917
-Do you know how much gas is?
-Hey!

173
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,999
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

174
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:28,755
Oh, my God, Cinnamon,
are you OK?!

175
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,518
I can't believe you two!

176
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,073
You do whatever it takes
to save her life.

177
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,117
If she needs new organs,
I'll buy any dog necessary

178
00:09:34,319 --> 00:09:35,991
and scrap them for parts!

179
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,192
-You're the owner?
-Owner, father, soul mate,

180
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,072
and if anything happens to her,
your worst nightmare!

181
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,910
Well, she's not throwing up,
which is a good sign.

182
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,350
So, I'm gonna take her in back,
put her on fluids

183
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,039
and give her something
to absorb the toxins.

184
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,639
OK. OK, thank you.

185
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,990
If she's scared, you can sing to her.
She likes Katy Perry.

186
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,273
But don't do "Firework"
That gets her all riled up.

187
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:02,558
Got it.

188
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,639
Should have been a dentist.

189
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,269
OK, what was the best four-ten-four
US locomotive ever built?

190
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,471
Trick question.
There never was one.

191
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,717
-Or was there?
-What?!

192
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,637
In 1944, the Pacific Railroad
built number 6131,

193
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:22,477
which rearranged
the drivers and cylinders,

194
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,352
solving the problem of the 0-1,

195
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,232
creating a duplex-drive
four-four-six-four.

196
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:29,954
In what world is a
four-four-six-four a four-ten-four?

197
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,593
Aworld I don't want to live in!

198
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,557
Seriously, I no longer want
to live in this world.

199
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,032
Hold on to your conductor's hat.
You crank the second and third axles,

200
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:42,275
creating a pair of
internal connecting rods,

201
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,233
and boom! Four-ten-four.
If you think about it,

202
00:10:45,439 --> 00:10:47,669
the 0-2 was like the four-ten-four
America never made.

203
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,269
I may never stop thinking about it.

204
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,675
Amy, what are the odds
we run into this guy?

205
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:54,232
Better than you think.

206
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,193
You know, if you ask nicely, they'll
let you visit the engine room.

207
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:03,515
I never want this day to end.

208
00:11:03,719 --> 00:11:05,198
It's feeling like it never will.

209
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,993
Come on.

210
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,519
Hey, did Itell you what
happened to me at UPS?

211
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,590
As if Valentine's Day wasn't bad
enough, you try to kill my dog?!

212
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,677
And with cheap chocolate, no less?

213
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,633
It wasn't cheap.
It was free.

214
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,478
We're really sorry.
It was an accident.

215
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,159
Yeah, we weren't even out
of the room that long.

216
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,510
No, come on. It was a while.

217
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,679
It was a while.

218
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,674
-Is Cinnamon gonna be OK?
-She's responding well.

219
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:40,188
We just want to keep her
a little longer for observation.

220
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,550
All right. Would it be OK
for me to see her?

221
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:45,478
We're usually in bed by now,
and I want her to know that I'm here.

222
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,115
Yes, we sleep together,
and sometimes we spoon.

223
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,517
It's OK. I sleep with my dog, too.

224
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,591
We're not supposed
to let people in back, but...

225
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,153
...I think I can make an exception.

226
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,078
-Thank you.
-Come on.

227
00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:03,759
-By the way, I sang her Katy Perry.
-Oh, yeah?

228
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:07,554
And I don't care what that obnoxious
parrot back there says. I crushed it.

229
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,996
I think there's something going
on between the two of them.

230
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:13,554
Maybe, but you also think
nine minutes isn't awhile,

231
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:14,953
so what do you know?

232
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,316
-You OK?
-Why?

233
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:27,431
Because my boyfriend's off
playing choo-choo with some weirdo?

234
00:12:28,719 --> 00:12:31,756
Well, to be fair,
they're both weirdos.

235
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,917
I don't know what made me think
tonight would be any different.

236
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,317
Well, just the fact that you got
him up here still says a lot.

237
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,669
To be honest, I bet Howie 200
bucks it wasn't gonna happen.

238
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,713
I'm going to the LEGO store
to get a big-ass R2-D2.

239
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:50,028
See? It's not just Sheldon.
They're all idiots.

240
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:53,552
She's right.

241
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,994
So your boyfriend's a fixer-upper.
Most of them are.

242
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,395
I mean, look at this guy.
You think he came like this?

243
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,636
When I met him,
he was a hot, goofy mess.

244
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,311
Now, he's been to space.

245
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,157
That's all me.

246
00:13:09,439 --> 00:13:12,158
-I had a little to do with it.
-Oh, sure you did.

247
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,590
Who's Mama's big space man?

248
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,517
I am.

249
00:13:24,999 --> 00:13:26,273
They've been in there,
like, half an hour.

250
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,153
Yeah, for future reference,
that's a while.

251
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:36,353
-How long should we stay?
-I don't know. I'm kind of hungry.

252
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,757
-I saw a Thai place next door.
-OK.

253
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,870
-How's she doing?
-How is everything?

254
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,832
She's gonna be OK.
They're gonna let me take her home.

255
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,995
Good.

256
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,269
So I want you to keep
a close eye on her

257
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,549
for the next 24 hours.

258
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:51,989
Here are a few warning
signs to look out for.

259
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,589
If you see any of them,
don't hesitate to call.

260
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,473
Thank you for taking such
good care of my little girl.

261
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,477
My pleasure.
Have a nice night.

262
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,238
Yes, thank you for all your help.

263
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,271
Yeah. I'm sorry if you didn't think
we were taking it seriously.

264
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:05,913
-We love animals.
-Do you guys own any pets?

265
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,509
-No.
-Good.

266
00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:17,037
I love you so much.

267
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,559
I love you, too.

268
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,471
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

269
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,952
You guys missed
a pretty great time.

270
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:34,151
The conductor and I have
the same pocket watch.

271
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,071
-It was crazy.
-Dare I say "loco?"

272
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,439
Oh, and, Amy, guess what?

273
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:43,277
The conductor said as
soon as he gets off work,

274
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,552
he can come back to the bed and
breakfast and play his banjo for us.

275
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,389
OK. I need to speak to my boyfriend
in private, like, right now.

276
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,398
There's a car with a glass roof.
Want to go look at the stars?

277
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,797
-That sounds so romantic.
-Give it a rest!

278
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:00,432
Let's go.

279
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,834
-Why are you still here?
-Excuse me.

280
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,632
I think you're being a little rude.

281
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,400
I'm being rude? You've been
rude to me this entire evening.

282
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,033
How is that possible?

283
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,198
I've hardly spoken
to you since we got on the train.

284
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:20,195
I'm detecting a little
friction between you two,

285
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,391
and I don't want to be a third rail.

286
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,507
Get it?

287
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,588
I get it.

288
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,114
Leave!

289
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:34,439
-What is your problem?
-It's Valentine's Day.

290
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,391
We're supposed to be
having a romantic weekend.

291
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,955
Oh, really?
Because I remember you saying

292
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,196
that this trip was going to be
something we could both enjoy.

293
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,358
Did you mean that,
or were you just trying to trick me?

294
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,516
Fine, it's true.
I deserve romance,

295
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,075
and I didn't know how
else to make it happen.

296
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,913
Well, if you want romance,
then let's have romance!

297
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,395
Oh, look, there's wine. Mm!

298
00:15:59,719 --> 00:16:01,994
Grape juice that burns.

299
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,839
Now let's gaze
into each other's eyes.

300
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,110
-You blinked. I win.
-Sheldon--

301
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:09,628
Let's see. What's next?
Kissing's romantic.

302
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,679
That was nice.

303
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,793
Good.

304
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,351
Um...

305
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,271
The conductor said if I come
back to the engine room,

306
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,756
he'd show me how to bring
the train through a crossing.

307
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,595
OK, have fun.

308
00:16:48,719 --> 00:16:50,835
Do you want to come with me?

309
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,315
Really? I do.

310
00:16:57,319 --> 00:16:58,547
Hey, guys, wait up!

311
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,436
(TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS)

312
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,189
There you go. All cozy wozy.

313
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,917
Here, let's see what the doctor
says to keep an eye out for.

314
00:17:16,479 --> 00:17:18,913
Hm. "Rajesh, Iwas
dreading Valentine's Day.

315
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,429
Thank you for spending it
with me. Yvette."

316
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,914
Cinnamon, she gave me
her phone number.

317
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,313
If I'd known it was that easy,
I would have considered

318
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,192
poisoning you months ago.

319
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,549
Oh, what should I say?

320
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:36,112
Oh, I know.

321
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,278
I'll point out her name's Yvette,
and that she's a vet.

322
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,959
That's hysterical.

323
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:42,433
She'll love it.

324
00:17:45,479 --> 00:17:46,958
-Hello.
-Hey. You're back.

325
00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:49,150
-How was your trip?
-It was wonderful!

326
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,715
-Great. What did you do?
-I made a new friend

327
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,637
who likes trains
as much as I do,

328
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,319
I kissed Amy on the lips,

329
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:58,193
and the conductor played his
banjo for me.

330
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,719
Good night.

331
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,911
Wait, wait, wait.
I'm gonna need more details.

332
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,395
Well, my new
friend's name was Eric.

333
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:08,989
Amy lips tasted like
the brownie we had for dessert.

334
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,595
The banjo-playing
conductor was missing a finger,

335
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,835
but he made up for it
with his can-do attitude.

336
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,673
No, hang on. Hang on.
Are all those things equal to you?

337
