1
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:05,716
I'm thinking about growing a gnatee.

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,998
Actually that's a Van Dyke.
A gnatee is just hair on the chin.

3
00:00:09,399 --> 00:00:11,959
Oh. Wait, then what is it
if you just have hair up here?

4
00:00:12,159 --> 00:00:13,069
You mean a mustache?

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,429
-Mnn-stache!
-(SHOUTS) He said it!

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,270
Ha-ha, very funny.
Make fun of the foreign guy.

7
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:19,634
For your information,
there are four times as many Indians

8
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:21,636
as there are Americans,
so the way we say it is right.

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,955
-Say what?
-Moo-stache.

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,798
-(SHOUTS) Moo-stache!
-He said "moo-stache".

11
00:00:25,999 --> 00:00:27,227
Guys, you're being childish.

12
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,398
She's right. You're grown men,
the kind who are perfectly capable

13
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:32,191
of growing your own moo-staches.

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:32,957
(LAUGHS)

15
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,554
Hey, you were funny
on purpose, good job.

16
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:40,036
Hi. Sorry I'm late.
I was at an audition.

17
00:00:40,639 --> 00:00:42,277
-l'm sorry.
-You'll get 'em next time.

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,310
How about instead of assuming I
failed, you ask me how it went?

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,793
Sorry. How did it go?

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,319
Just shut up.

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,030
Here, you can have your seat.

22
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,037
No, no, stay there.
I'm fine on the floor.

23
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,990
Have you guys ever thought about
getting a dining room table?

24
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,508
Yeah. You actually do have
room for one up there.

25
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:02,392
Sure, I sit on the floor
for years, no one cares.

26
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,714
The pretty white girl's
there ten seconds,

27
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,956
and suddenly we're
all running to IKEA.

28
00:01:07,399 --> 00:01:08,991
No one is running anywhere.

29
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,872
We're not getting
a dining room table.

30
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:13,639
I know you don't like change,
but it's not a terrible idea.

31
00:01:13,839 --> 00:01:15,318
You guys never use
that space up there.

32
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:16,429
Why not get a table?

33
00:01:16,639 --> 00:01:18,436
Do you want the long answer
or the short answer?

34
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,437
How come we never get that option?

35
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:25,475
Chaos theory suggests that
even in a deterministic system,

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,433
if the equations describing
its behavior are nonlinear,

37
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,596
a tiny change
in the initial conditions

38
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,758
can lead to a cataclysmic
and unpredictable result.

39
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,190
Translation?

40
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:37,435
(IMITATES BABY)
Wah! I don't want a table!

41
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:43,589
(THEME some)

42
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,995
Hey, Penny and l are gonna go
shop for a dining room table.

43
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,269
You want to come with us?

44
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,029
I'd love to, but, I'm too busy

45
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,232
falling back in love
with Windows 98.

46
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,030
Seriously? You haven't used
this desk in years.

47
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,116
The second I want to get rid of it,
you're up here working?

48
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,594
I can't talk right now.

49
00:02:23,799 --> 00:02:26,108
l have several thousand updates
to install.

50
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,717
Are you really
gonna sit here all day?

51
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:31,149
Think of me as Arthur Dent in

52
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,270
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,

53
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,199
lying in front of the bulldozers
to protect his home.

54
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,472
If you'll recall, the Vogon fleet
blew up the Earth anyway.

55
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:42,153
It's a made-up story. I don't even
know why you're talking about it.

56
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,033
I'm putting all this stuff
in storage. We don't need any of it.

57
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,792
How can you say that?

58
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,150
You show me one thing
in here we can live without.

59
00:02:51,279 --> 00:02:52,678
Hang on.

60
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,549
Check your in-box.

61
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:01,907
Wait. Is this really worth it?

62
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,795
We've lived together for years
with nary an argument.

63
00:03:05,999 --> 00:03:06,909
Huh?

64
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,792
But we start talking about a table,

65
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,911
and suddenly we're
at each other's throats.

66
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,192
"Nary an argument"?

67
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,871
"Nary"?

68
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:20,835
That means "not one," or "not any".

69
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:24,274
Maybe instead of a table,
you should buy a dictionary.

70
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,672
I don't know if I won that,
but at least he's upset.

71

Yeah, I can control
all sorts of stuff.

74
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,994
Did Bernadette think it was cool?

75
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,158
Not when I said "mute"
and pointed it at her face.

76
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:46,917

Okay. Thank you.
We'll be in touch.

89
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,674
You're not gonna believe this.

90
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,548
What's going on?

91
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,668
Wait.

What's going on?

95
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:43,390
That was NASA.

96
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:46,716
They want me to go
back up to the space station.

97
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,274
Wow. What did you tell them?

98
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:50,878
ltold them I'd be honored.

99
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,148
A second trip to space.
I'll miss you.

100
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,632
And I'm gonna miss you, too.

101
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:56,749
| just want you to know,

102
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,678
I'm happy to look in on Bernadette
while you're gone.

103

And if anything were to happen
to you,

105
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,191
we will name our
firstborn son Howard.

106

I'm just kidding.

107
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,197
We'll name him Dalib,
after my grandfather.

00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:13,151
This one looks nice.

109
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:15,833
No. Sheldon doesn't like
reclaimed wood.

110

Why not?

111

He's afraid the original owners
will come back.

112
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,559
Well, Sheldon's not here.

113
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,875
Well, he is here.

114
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:28,758
Unless you want to dig him out
with a bone saw and a melon baller,

115
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,757
there's nothing I can do about it.

116
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,678
All right, sweetie,
you're paying for this table,

117
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:33,789
and it's your apartment, too.

118
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,558
-I know, but--
-No buts.

119
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,194
You got to stop
letting him boss you around.

120
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:41,470
You're right. I mean,
he decides what TV shows we watch,

121
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,875
what food we eat,
who my favorite hobbit is.

122
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,990
I wanted Frodo,
but we can't both have Frodo,

123
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:48,110
so guess who's stuck
with Samwise Gamgee.

124
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:51,517
See? Right there.
You're a grown man,

125
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,756
you should be able to pick
whichever hobbit you want.

126
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,475
Wish you wouldn't,
but one problem at a time.

127
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:01,631
You make a lot of sense.

128
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,355
I like this table,
and I'm getting it.

129
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:06,430
Really? This one?

130
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,788
That one?

131
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,833
Damn right I like that one.

132
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,432
-Hey.
-Good news.

133
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:21,154
Someone in this room
gets to take a ride on a rocket.

134
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:23,952
Fine.
Can I at least shower first?

135
00:06:25,159 --> 00:06:26,069
No, not that.

136
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:28,031
Although you already agreed
to it, so no take-backs.

137
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,675
What are you talking about?

138
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,074
Sit down.

139
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:33,712
NASA called.

140
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,717
The telescope mount
I installed on the space station

141
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:41,038
got damaged, and they want me
to go back up and fix it.

142
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,354
Wow.

143
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:45,478
Well, what did you say?

144
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:48,068
What do you think l....?
I said yes!

145
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:49,149
Why do you look surprised?

146
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:50,917
Well, it'sjust, after last time,

147
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,671
I didn't think you'd
ever want to go back.

148
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:55,797
Are you kidding? It was the greatest
experience of my life.

149
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:58,792
Really? 'Cause I kind of
remember a lot of complaining

150
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:00,990
and wishing for it to be over.

151
00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:03,353
I think you have me confused

152
00:07:03,559 --> 00:07:05,993
with what's gonna happen when
you get out of that shower.

153
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:12,358
Hey, all set.
What do you think?

154
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:15,278
There's plenty of room for everybody,
a view out the window.

155
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,516
My spot on the couch
has a great view of a window.

156
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,353
Sometimes I can see
space battles through it.

157
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:21,548
It's called a TV.

158
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:25,799
Give it a chance, Sheldon,
you might actually like it.

159
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,438
You're absolutely right.

160
00:07:30,999 --> 00:07:32,352
Nope.

161
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:36,834
Well, you can't say he
didn't give it a fair shot.

162
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,598
So, when can we get rid of it?

163
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,590
We're not.

164
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,551
What about the roommate agreement?

165
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,399
lt specifically states
that any changes in furnishing

166
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:46,430
have to be approved
by the Furnishing Committee.

167
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,630
Which only sits on alternate years.

168
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:51,307
Yeah, and by the way,
it sits over there.

169
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,599
Come on, that is ridiculous.

170
00:07:53,799 --> 00:07:56,757
She's right. A committee that
important should meet more often.

171
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,628
That's not what I'm saying.

172
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,399
This is the thing
about me standing up to him

173
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,715
and not letting him run my life?

174
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:03,988
Yes.

175
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,553
That.

176
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,073
Okay. I think we've
found the problem here.

177
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:10,917
It's not the table at all.

178
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,075
lt's you.

179
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,315
Me?

180
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,397
It's always me,
take one for the team.

181
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,395
l have spent years
turning this lump of clay

182
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,556
into an acceptable conduit
for my will,

183
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,035
and then you came along
and reshaped him,

184
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:26,231
with your newfangled ideas
and your fancy genitals.

185
00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:29,471
Are you gonna let him
talk to me like this?

186
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,630
"Fancy" sounds like a compliment.

187
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,037
Okay, I have not tried
to change Leonard.

188
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,719
That's just what happens
in relationships.

189
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,478
Look how much Amy's changed you.

190
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,551
-That's not true.
-Please.

191
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:41,317
When I first met you,
you were incapable

192
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,793
of touching another human being.

193
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,354
Now you're holding hands,
you're going on dates,

194
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,437
you even made out with her
on a train.

195
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,109
She told you?

196
00:08:49,319 --> 00:08:50,991
Of course she told me,
it's the most interesting thing

197
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,917
that's ever happened to
her in her entire life!

198
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,715
You're too close to it,
but Amy has had a huge impact on you.

199
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,187
You're right.

200
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:02,955
Without realizing it,
I've allowed that woman

201
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,638
to alter my personality.

202
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:06,912
Sheldon, you didn't
have a personality,

203
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,758
you just had some shows you liked.

204
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,549
No.

205
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,193
No, I've changed.

206
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,469
Like the frog who's put
in a pot of water

207
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,908
that's heated so gradually

208
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,111
he doesn't realize
he's boiling to death.

209
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,235
Or you're the frog who's
been kissed by a princess

210
00:09:22,439 --> 00:09:23,508
and turned into a prince.

211
00:09:23,719 --> 00:09:25,869
Or you're just a tall, annoying frog.

212
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:28,112
Excuse me.

213
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,952
l have to break up
with my girlfriend.

214
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,355
-Sheldon, wait.
-No.

215
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,596
You've opened my eyes to the truth.

216
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,475
Amy has made me a more affectionate,
open-minded person.

217
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:41,674
And that stops now.

218
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,791
-We should call her.
-Yeah.

219
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,395
Amy, it's Penny. Hey.
Just a little heads-up.

220
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,750
Leonard bought a dining room table.

221
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,072
Yeah. Sheldon's breaking up with you.

222
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:02,155
Amy? Amy?

223
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,028
Amy?

224
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,153
I'll get right to the point.

225
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,352
I think we need to end this
relationship, so....

226
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,074
Just sign this
with your finger, and...

227
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,398
please don't cry on my iPad.
I didn't get AppleCare.

228
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,437
I'm not surprised you want
to end the relationship.

229
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,029
I'm a little surprised
you didn't get AppleCare.

230
00:10:23,439 --> 00:10:25,634
Anyway, enjoy your life.
Where do | sign?

231
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,398
At the bottom. I must say,

232
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,909
l'm relieved you're not making
more of a scene out of this.

233
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,394
I've already moved on.

234
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,358
Besides, this breakup has
nothing to do with me.

235
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,390
It doesn't?

236
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,511
Of course not.
This is just Leonard

237
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,950
trying to take the focus
off that dreadful table

238
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:41,672
by sowing discord
in our relationship.

239
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:43,995
He's manipulating you
like he always does.

240
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,918
Wait, now, hang on.

241
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,352
You think he manipulates me?

242
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,515
All the time.

243
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,518
And he knew that as your girlfriend,
I wasn't gonna stand by

244
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,915
and let him bring atable
into your apartment.

245
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,076
I mean, a table? Come on!

246
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,913
It is hideous.

247
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,268
Well, thankfully,
I won't have to see it,

248
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,833
'cause I won't be your
girlfriend anymore.

249
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,078
Amy Farrah Fowler.

250
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,672
Why, yes, lwould like
to take a survey.

251
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:14,278
Wait.

252
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,399
You were really gonna stand by me
against the dining room table?

253
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,113
Of course I was.

254
00:11:21,999 --> 00:11:23,398
Wait.

255
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,831
How do I know that you're
not manipulating me right now?

256
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,079
I think if I were manipulating you,
you'd be smart enough to see it.

257
00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:36,157
How do I know you're not saying that
as part of the manipulation?

258
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,675
I think you'd be smart
enough to see that, too.

259
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,834
Okay.

260
00:11:44,599 --> 00:11:46,669
I'm sorry I gave you such a hard
time, ljust had to be sure.

261
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,552
It's pretty exciting that NASA
wants to send Howard back up.

262
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,238
Yeah, exciting.

263
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,308
Can I ask you something?

264
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,669
Course.

265
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,910
He hated that entire experience.

266
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,314
Does it make me an awful wife

267
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:04,032
if I don't think he
should do it again?

268
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,389
Not at all.

269
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:08,511
He's forgotten how miserable he was
the entire time he was up there.

270
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,190
It's like me in those moments
when I miss India.

271
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,149
So you'll talk to him?

272
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:15,155
Why me?

273
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,349
l'm his wife,
I don't want to ruin it for him.

274
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,154
That's the dynamic. I'm the
fun one, you're the buzzkill.

275
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,310
Since when am | the buzzkill?

276
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,031
-Do you think this is cool?
-No, I think it's stupid.

277
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,355
Aha!

278
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:29,718
You're right, it's great.

279
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,588
-Hello.
-Hey.

280
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,869
You guys didn't break up.

281
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:40,674
No. Sorry to disappoint you,
but Amy pointed out

282
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,472
that you we only trying
to manipulate me.

283
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,715
Which you also
figured out by yourself.

284
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,876
Which I also figured out by myself.

285
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:48,913
Well, I'm glad you're still together.

286
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,714
Okay, you can stop trying
to make this about our relationship.

287
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,309
-Which is stronger than ever.
-Which is stronger than ever.

288
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,873
This is about you
trying to change my environment,

289
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,718
which was perfect the way it was.

290
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,514
But it got the way it was
through change.

291
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,871
The spot that you love to sit in,
that no one else can sit in,

292
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,358
only exists because, despite your
objections, I bought this couch.

293
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:15,149
Me. So explain why that change
was bad and this change was good.

294
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:18,473
Um....

295
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,159
You don't need to
explain yourself to him.

296
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,430
I don't need to explain
myself to you!

297
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,596
You're sick of his nonsense
and ready to move in with me.

298
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:28,517
Keep the table!
We don't use that space!

299
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,118
Damn it, I got cocky.

300
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,471
Hey, Bernie.
I'm home.... Hello.

301
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,635
Hi, honey.

302
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:43,948
What's going on?

303
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:46,073
Maybe you should have a seat.

304
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,712
Okay.

305
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:50,790
I know my mom's not dead,
there'd be balloons.

306
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:56,627
First off, know that
we all love you and cherish you.

307
00:13:56,839 --> 00:13:58,557
-Well, lwouldn't--
-Daddy.

308
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,993
You're great.

309
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,789
-Can I say something?
-Of course.

310
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:08,318
Hey, Fruit Loops.

311
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,079
Massimino?
Why are you here?

312
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,077
[heard you were thinking about going
back up to the space station,

313
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,356
and as someone
who's been there with you....

314
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,755
well, you know how astronauts
need to have the "right stuff"?

315
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,233
Sure.

316
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,192
The stuff you have is wrong.

317
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,955
You don't think
I did a good job up there?

318
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,434
You did a finejob.

319
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:32,278
It's just, you were scared
and miserable the whole time.

320
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,079
I think what we're all trying to say
is, you don't seem to be remembering

321
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,157
how traumatic the experience
was for you.

322
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:41,396
Like how women often forget
the pain of childbirth.

323
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,751
Like a woman. Great analogy.

324
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,430
Fine, maybe I was a little scared.

325
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,437
You peed in your space suit.

326
00:14:50,439 --> 00:14:51,554
You're supposed to do that.

327
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,591
Not during the ﬁtting.

328
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,800
Son, do I need to remind you
what you asked me to do

329
00:14:57,999 --> 00:14:59,512
before you went up last time?

330
00:14:59,719 --> 00:15:02,279
Hang on.
That was just me joking around.

331
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,675
You wanted me to shoot you
in the foot.

332
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,708
Come on, how is that not ajoke?

333
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,797
"You got to get me out of this.
Shoot me in the foot."

334
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:14,268
Don't forget all the other
astronauts picking on you.

335
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:16,352
And how you threw up
in zero gravity,

336
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,152
and it floated back in your mouth.

337
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,238
And you threw up again.
And so on and so on.

338
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,079
That was funny.

339
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:30,596
Okay, so I wasn't
exactly John Glenn up there,

340
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:33,518
but I've changed,
I'm a different man now.

341
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:37,473
I'm a little insulted that you guys
don't think I can handle it.

342
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,069
You know you're gonna have to go
through survival training again.

343
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:41,314
Really?

344
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,630
You've got to get me out of this!

345
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,030
What do you want me to do?
You're perfectly healthy.

346
00:15:46,239 --> 00:15:47,797
Check my blood pressure again!

347
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:49,955
I can get it higher,
just give me a second.

348
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,515
- MRS. WOLOWITZ: Hello?
-Hi, Ma. How are you?

349
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,232
(YELLS) How I am is not dead!

350
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,669
But you wouldn't know that,
because you don't love me enough

351
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:01,073
to pick up the phone!

352
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,599
(WHISPERS) Go, go, go!

353
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,910
For all you know, I could have
slipped in the tub and drowned!

354
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,076
That's what happened
to your Aunt Ida!

355
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:12,272
Wow.

356
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,068
Howard, I'm so sorry your blood
pressure was off the charts.

357
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,749
Me, too. The doctor was willing
to fudge the results,

358
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,997
but it just seemed
so darned dishonest.

359
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,118
But the mission wouldn't be
for at least a year.

360
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:32,071
Isn't that enough time to get
your blood pressure under--

361
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,554
My blood pressure's too high, okay?
Drop it.

362
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,994
You know, my aunt changed her diet,
and in a few months, she--

363
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,633
Went to space? I don't think so.
Now, pass the soy sauce.

364
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,113
Not the green one, the red one.

365
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,315
Sheldon, Amy,
will you please comejoin us?

366
00:16:47,479 --> 00:16:48,673
It's fun up here.

367
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,110
So why are you trying to ruin it?

368
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,190
No, thanks. We're fine.

369
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,230
I mean, if you people
want to eat at the table,

370
00:16:56,439 --> 00:16:58,157
then that's what you should do.

371
00:16:58,359 --> 00:16:59,792
I like eating down here

372
00:16:59,999 --> 00:17:02,433
because this is how
we've always done things.

373
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,709
But if those days are gone,
they're gone.

374
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:07,308
It just makes me sad.

375
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,108
Now I feel bad.

376
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,595
Don't anthropomorphize him,
he's got big eyes,

377
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,869
but his feelings are not like ours.

378
00:17:17,639 --> 00:17:19,994
No, it just seems silly
for us to sit in two groups.

379
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:21,837
It's not silly
if you think of that group

380
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:24,394
as being led by a big, evil baby.

381
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:31,038
Look at Amy down there.

382
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,108
Should we go?

383
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,954
Let's go.

384
00:17:35,159 --> 00:17:36,592
Penny, this was your idea.

385
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,437
You said that I should
stand up to him.

386
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,834
Forget it, Leonard.

387
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:41,392
It's over.

388
00:17:42,639 --> 00:17:43,594
Fine.

389
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,074
Rajesh?

390
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,837
Screw that! I sat
on the floor for seven years.

391
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,597
I'm staying right here!

392
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,075
Come on, Raj,
it's not the same without you.

393
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,679
Fine.

394
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:04,389
But no more making fun
of how I say tings.

395
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,030
You mean "tings"
like "moo-stache"?

396
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,038
Well, isn't this nice.

397
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:19,197
Sometimes the baby wins.

398
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:44,956
