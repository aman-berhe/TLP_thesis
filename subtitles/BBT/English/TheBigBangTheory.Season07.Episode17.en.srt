1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,073
Raj, your tag's sticking out.

2
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:08,873
Thank you. That's the closest
I've come to sex in, like, two years.

3
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:12,712
Now | feel a little grass.

4
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,396
You're only making it seem
more real for me.

5
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,587
Hey, that's my wife.

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,109
If anyone's gonna make her feel
gross about sex, it's me.

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,838
Can we please talk about something
other than my depressing love life?

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,996
How about Penny's
depressing acting career?

9
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,430
Hey. It's been a little tough,
but Penny's following her dreams,

10
00:00:32,639 --> 00:00:34,709
and in my book,
that is not depressing.

11
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:36,198
Aw, thank you.

12
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,436
Is that book called
Lies I Tell to Get Sal?

13
00:00:39,959 --> 00:00:42,553
Is that a real book?
I would totally read that book.

14
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,158
Can I borrow it when you're done?

15
00:00:49,839 --> 00:00:50,988
Well, I'll have you guys know

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,758
I turned down a part
in a movie last week.

17
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:54,028
Why would you do that?

18
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:55,148
Because it was crap.

19
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:57,793
It was a sequel to that awful
killer gorilla movie l was in.

20
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,514
Serial Ape-ist?

21
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:02,467
I thought you died in that.

22
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:04,237
She does. 42 minutes in.

23
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,273
While showering topless,
16 minutes after brief side butt

24
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:09,231
during a pillow fight
with her sorority sisters.

25
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,279
l have an eidetic memory.
I don't know what his problem is.

26
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,397
Okay, well, there are no
shower scenes in this one.

27
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:18,952
Theyjust try to clone me
from my corpse,

28
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,912
but my DNA gets mixed
with the ape's DNA

29
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,680
and lend up running around
with giant gorilla hands and feet.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,753
Am I missing something, or isn't that
the part she was born to play?

31
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,550
Jâ€œ (THEME SONG PLAYS)

32
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,235
So are you really not
gonna do this movie?

33
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,113
Well, I don't think it's the kind
of part that's good for my career.

34
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:04,318
But don't a lot of famous actors
get their start doing bad movies?

35
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:06,749
Okay, I don't think Meryl Streep
ever had to say,

36
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,952
"Must keep gorilla hands
from killing again!"

37
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,873
If she did, it would be amazing.
That woman can do no wrong.

38
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,314
I don't know anything
about show business,

39
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:22,749
so if you think it's reasonable
to turn down paid work

40
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,313
and just burn through
your savings,

41
00:02:24,359 --> 00:02:25,758
I'm sure you know what
you're doing.

42
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,239
I think we're gonna go.

43
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,952
Are you sure?

44
00:02:35,999 --> 00:02:37,591
We were making fun of
failed careers.

45
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,836
We didn't get to tap
the juicy vein that is Howard's.

46
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,988
Hey, lwork
at the same university you do.

47
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,270
Yes, and Hawkeye's in
the Avengers,

48
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,198
but no one ever says,
"Help, Hawkeye!"

49
00:02:50,559 --> 00:02:52,038
Can I ask you something?

50
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,594
Why do you constantly feel
the need to put down my husband?

51
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,312
I'm sure he does it out of love.

52
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,272
The same way my boyfriend
makes me feel terrible

53
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,992
about my life choices.

54
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,038
I think we're gonna go.

55
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,597
No, no. This is not afight.

56
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,519
l was just excited that
someone offered you a part

57
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:11,357
and a little surprised
that you'd rather sit at home

58
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:12,787
and do nothing than take it.

59
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,315
Now it's a fight.

60
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,388
Well, with that sorted out,

61
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,158
I'm happy to answer your
question, Bernadette.

62
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:24,792
Howard started it.

63
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,917
I didn't do anything.
I was just sitting here.

64
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,678
I wasn't referring to this evening.

65
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,836
Ten years ago,
upon first seeing me,

66
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:33,155
your husband claimed
that I looked like C-SPO

67
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:34,872
and Pee-wee Herman.

68
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,708
And he called me
C-SP-wee Herman.

69
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,960
(LAUGHING)
Still funny.

70
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:48,997
That was ten years ago.

71
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,675
Nine years, 11 months
and three weeks ago,

72
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,599
he followed that up by replacing
the slides for my lecture

73
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,473
with photographs
of nude fat women bending over.

74
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:00,909
Really?

75
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,633
The lecture was on
cosmic gas clouds.

76
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,193
That's funny!

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,797
l was there. It was funny.

78
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,078
In any event, that began
a decade-long progression

79
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:18,715
of insults, pranks and
unwanted magazine subscriptions.

80
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,951
To this day,
I still get a monthly copy

81
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,752
of Granny on Granny.

82
00:04:24,679 --> 00:04:26,271
Which, other than its
surprisingly fun puzzle page,

83
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:27,514
is complete filth.

84
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,112
Thanks for walking me
to my car.

85
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:35,272
Actually, it's for both of us.

86
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:36,798
Last night, I watched
West Side Story,

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,752
and I'm a little freaked out
by street gangs.

88
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:43,511
Why can't Raj find a girl?
The mystery continues.

89
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,680
I don't appreciate
your sarcasm,

90
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:50,154
but we've still got two blocks
to go, so I'll put up with it.

91
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,469
Whatever happened with
your online dating?

92
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:57,477
No one was writing me back,
so I stopped checking my profile.

93
00:04:57,679 --> 00:04:59,874
Before I met Sheldon,
I was ready to give up, too.

94
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,717
Once, I even dropped
in on my OBIGYN

95
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,751
just to get some
human contact.

96
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,348
It has been awhile
since I got my prostate checked.

97
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,878
Then I met Sheldon
and look at where we are now.

98
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,908
What? You've kissed, like,
once in three years.

99
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,318
That's true.
Do whatever you want.

100
00:05:21,679 --> 00:05:23,476
-Hey.
-Hello.

101
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,710
Listen,
l was thinking you and l

102
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,151
could probably try
to be better friends.

103
00:05:30,359 --> 00:05:31,758
Really?

104
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:34,348
l was thinking
what we have now is a bit much.

105
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,832
Seriously, I was talking
to Bernadette last night and

106
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:43,995
she made some great points.

107
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,033
You and l have known each other
a long time,

108
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,913
and I didn't hear the rest
'cause she took her bra off.

109
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,392
Very well.
(CLEARS THROAT)

110
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,955
How do you propose
we move forward?

111
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,709
For starters, we could stop
insulting each other.

112
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,398
That's a great idea.

113
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:05,157
And in the spirit
of our new arrangement,

114
00:06:05,359 --> 00:06:07,953
I will mask my surprise
that you came up with it.

115
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,548
Anyway, I got invited
to do a little talk at NASA

116
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,193
in Houston this weekend.

117
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,709
They gave me two tickets.
Bernadette can't go.

118
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,114
You want to come with me?
You can visit your mom,

119
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,436
and I'll show you
around the space center.

120
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,233
l have one question.

121
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,112
Is this a prank
where we land in Houston

122
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:32,832
and you've made up
wanted posters

123
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,634
that have my face with
a mustache and a Spanish name

124
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,274
and then I get arrested
and deported to South America?

125
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,630
No.

126
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,637
I'm glad because I would not
have seen that coming.

127
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,948
Amy, I could use some help.

128
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,594
Let me guess. There's an undergrad
in a leatherjacket

129
00:06:52,799 --> 00:06:54,676
snapping his fingers
by the water fountain.

130
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:58,635
I thought about
what you said last night,

131
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:00,557
and I went back
on the dating website

132
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,876
and l was looking
at this girl's profile.

133
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,069
She's amazing.

134
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:06,315
Oh, she's cute.

135
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:08,316
And smart. Phi Beta Kappa.

136
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,794
And judging by her lack
of Adam's apple,

137
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,752
she's been female her entire life.

138
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,673
I like that in awoman.

139
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,670
Great,
so what do you need me for?

140
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,472
Well, l was up all night trying
to write to her,

141
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:23,317
but I wanted to run it by
you first.

142
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,839
-All right.
-(CLEARS THROAT)

143
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,788
"Emily,

144
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:31,232
yourface is like
a precious dew-kissed flower."

145
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,555
Wow.

146
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,069
I know.
Powerful stuff, huh?

147
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:41,069
No. You're supposed to be yourself,
not all desperate and creepy.

148
00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:43,710
Okay, I'm getting
some mixed messages here.

149
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,316
Just say something normal like,
"I saw your profile.

150
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:50,430
"Looks like we have
a lot in common.

151
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,357
Let's get a cup of coffee sometime."

152
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,439
Yes. "Where I can be jealous of
the cup touching your ruby lips."

153
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,354
Or you just write it for me.

154
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:01,833
I'm not gonna pretend to be you.

155
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,439
I don't want you
to pretend to be me.

156
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:05,550
You can be my online wingman.

157
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,194
Like if we met her at a bar
and you talked me up.

158
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,238
Well, what would I say to her?

159
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:12,191
Just tell her what I'm really like.

160
00:08:13,239 --> 00:08:15,389
And, if you think it'll help,

161
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,636
that you saw me changing once
and my package reminded you

162
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,990
of the muscular tail of ajaguar.

163
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,359
Use your own words.

164
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,157
Thanks again for taking me
to the pharmacy.

165
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,157
It's no problem.
Is everything okay?

166
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:38,954
I'm fine. It's just some
stomach medication for my trip.

167
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,720
There's the remote
yet distinct possibility

168
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,070
that I may end up
in South America.

169
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,437
Remember the old days when I
would've said something dumb

170
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,311
like, "Why?"

171
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,792
(ENGINE THUMPING)

172
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,513
Uh, that doesn't sound good.

173
00:08:57,679 --> 00:08:59,397
Remember the old days
when | used to point out

174
00:08:59,599 --> 00:09:01,157
that your check engine light
was on?

175
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,070
-Yes.
-Get ready to go down memory lane.

176
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,238
-Penny, your check engine...
-Yeah, I know it's on, Sheldon!

177
00:09:08,439 --> 00:09:11,556
Oh, no, no.
I cannot afford this right now.

178
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,878
Maybe it'sjust something minor.

(ENGINE BANGS, HISSES)

180
00:09:22,319 --> 00:09:23,832
Oh, good news,
the light just went out.

181
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,833
Are we playing individual
or teams?

182
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,950
Teams are fun.

183
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:35,912
In that case, I'd like to be
partnered with my good friend Howard.

184
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,872
But I'm always on Howard's team.
We're best friends.

185
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,071
The kind who finish each others...

186
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,595
I really don't think we do tha--

187
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,358
Do that! See?

188
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:53,709
-Oh, hi.
-How'd it go at the mechanic?

189
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,239
Not great.
Can I talk to you for a sec?

190
00:09:55,439 --> 00:09:56,838
Yeah, sure.

191
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,469
Maybe I can go with you
guys to Houston?

192
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,795
Isn't it late to get plane tick--

193
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,399
Plane tickets? Yeah.

194
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,032
-Will you please sto--
-Stop that? Okay.

195
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,076
I don't know what to do.
My car threw a rod and it's totaled.

196
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,679
I can't afford a new one,
l have no job,

197
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,073
and now I can't drive to auditions.

198
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,758
I'm so sorry.

199
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,551
I know it's a sensitive subject,

200
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:20,636
but can you reconsider
that part in the movie?

201
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:22,875
I did. I called them.
The part's gone.

202
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,638
They gave it to someone else.

203
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,910
Now that girl's gonna get
discovered and become famous

204
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,997
and go on Letterman and talk
about how she got her big break

205
00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:30,109
on a cheap monkey movie

206
00:10:30,319 --> 00:10:32,674
all because some dumb girl
thought it was beneath her.

207
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:36,470
At least they talked
about you on Letterman.

208
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,191
Come on, I can drive you
wherever you need to go.

209

How?
Unlike me, you have ajob.

210
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,276
I'm just gonna have to go back
to being a waitress.

211
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,471
Like I will be
for the rest of my life.

212
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,315
Leonard, would you wrap it up?
We're waiting on you.

213
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,798
I'm sorry, is the fact
that my life's falling apart

214
00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:55,796
interfering with your board game?

215
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,799
It is.

216
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:03,438
You were wrong, friend Howard.
She completely understood.

No. What's up?

00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:12,116
Have you heard back from Emily?

220
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,230
l have.

221
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,873
Great! And?

222
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,913
And I'm afraid she doesn't think
you're right for her.

223
00:11:19,999 --> 00:11:22,718
I give you one simple thing to do.

224
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,354
Contact a complete stranger and
make her fall in love with me,

225
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,913
and you blow it!

226
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,077
I told her what a good guy you are,

227
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:32,315
but she thought it was a bad sign

228
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,317
that you didn't write
to her yourself.

229
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:38,307
She thought it made you seem
too shy and passive.

230
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:39,747
I'm not too shy and passive.

231
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:42,075
You write her back
and tell her I said that.

232
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,158
You know,
when you have a second.

233
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,989
Look, I'll see if I can change
her mind tomorrow night.

234
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,519
What's happening tomorrow night?

235
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:52,357
l'm meeting her for coffee.

236
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:53,949
What?

237
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,674
We emailed back and forth a bit,
and we kind of hit it off.

and you're stealing her?

239
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:01,034

having a lot in common.

on the wounded petals of my heart.

on a romantic getaway.

You just went to the bathroom.

265

I didn't use it because
it didn't seem safe.

Well, it still doesn't.

You just don't like admitting it,
because you're jealous.

Well, truth be told,

278
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,229
as a child,
I did dream of going to space.

Thank you.

282
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,995

they'll just send anyone up there.

-Aren't you going to let me out?
-No.

just the equalization

variations in the atmosphere.

back to Earth,

to the Cheesecake Factory,

00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,073
or are we having sex?

I'm just trying to lighten the mood.

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,673
-I know. Thank you.
-Sorry.

309
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:31,392
It's just so humiliating.

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,919
So humiliating?

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,599
Am I driving you to

I'm sorry.
I'll stop. I'll stop.

Maybe tonight will be great.

Sweetie, I know you're trying
to make me feel better,

316
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:46,751
and I love you for that,
but it's making me feel worse,

317
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,278
and I kind of hate you.

318
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,349
This isn't your car.

319
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,835
I know. I thought we'd take yours.

320
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,869
I don't understand.

321
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,151
It's nothing fancy,
but it'll get you to auditions,

322
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,669
and at least for now, you don't
have to go back to waitressing.

323
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:09,118
I don't know what to say.

324
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:12,432
Don't say anything.

325
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:13,953
Oh, my God.

326
00:16:15,439 --> 00:16:17,953
I mean, you could say, "Thank you."
I did just buy you a car.

327
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,271
Look, I admit that it's odd that
Rajesh didn't write to you himself,

328
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,712
but if you get to know him, you'll
see he's just a sweet, regular guy.

329
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,753
As a counterpoint, here he is,
uninvited and visibly sweaty.

330
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,878
-Hello, Emily.
-Hello.

331
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,708
Amy told me you were concerned
that I might be too passive and shy.

332
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,319
Let me ask you something.

333
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,637
Would a passive guy barge in here
to look you in the eye and say,

334
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,989
"Hey, dew-kissed flower, what's up?"

335
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,033
No, but a weird guy
with no boundaries might.

336
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,719
Okay, that's a separate issue.

337
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,434
Let's put a pin in that
and just focus on the passive thing.

338
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:00,754
I'm leaving.

339
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,871
Are we still going to go to
that Chaucer reading Friday?

340
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:04,637
You know, lthink
I'm just gonna go by myself.

341
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,118
Not my best first date.

342
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,033
Yeah, but not my worst, either.

343
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,517
I'm sorry for every mean thing
lever did or said to you!

344
00:17:20,719 --> 00:17:22,710
I'm sorry, too!
It's all my fault!

345
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,914
If you weren't my friend,
there'd be a hole in my life!

346
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,394
Thank you, Sheldon.

347
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:30,669
Kind of like when
Firefly was cancelled.

348
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,588
But not as big.

349
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:40,871
(BELL CHIMES)

350
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,150
WOMAN: The captain has turned off
the fasten seat belt sign.

351
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:45,315
You're now free
to move about the cabin.

352
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,471
-lt's over.
-Yeah.

353
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:50,112
(BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY)

354
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:54,153
Should we stop
holding hands now?

355
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,352
-In a minute.
-Okay, good.

356
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,637
