00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,439
I did.
His talk at NASA went great.

Sheldon didn't heckle him?

10
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,279
No, in fact, he was so well-behaved,

Oh, boy.

80

Despite what her Bible says,
recent archeological studies indicate

81
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,519
that although camels are
referenced in the Old Testament,

82
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,837
they didn't exist in the Middle East
until hundreds of years later.

a cake or a pie.

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:18,435
I can't tell you that.
But perhaps the killer dropped

somewhere in the apartment.

any clues inside a beer.

Can I ask you something? Why do you
like making us do this stuff?

98
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,233

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,199
Yeah, I was 200 pounds
by the time l was in middle school.

102
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,675
Kids were mean.
Cows may be sacred there,

Anyway, I was pretty lonely,

105
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,516

my own stories and games,

106
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,711

if I ever made any friends

those games with them.

Hey, you guys just time-traveled.
Stop looking so bored.

Well, my beer isn't flat
and my rack's not saggy.

So far, the future's great.

00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,434
Hey, can I go to the bathroom?

180
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,471
Fine, just try not to look too alive.

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,590
That's myjam.

182
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:54,430
So one of us went back
in time to kill Stuart?

-But why?
-Perhaps this will help.

184
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,519
Here are some facts
about yourselves in the future

185
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,029
that might contain a clue.

Hey, lwon
the Nobel Prize in physiology.

187
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:10,067
Then I used the money to buy
Stuart's comic book store,

188
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,748
and close it down so Sheldon
would pay attention to me.

189
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,958
Not the worst idea.

190
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,995
Hey, I'm a famous actress
living in London.

191
00:09:22,199 --> 00:09:23,837
I'm a professor at Stanford.

192
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:25,995
So I guess you two are
making it work long distance.

193
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,793
Oh, no. In this game,
as your careers both took off,

194
00:09:28,999 --> 00:09:31,467
you drifted apart.
Kind of like how future me

195
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,318
lost touch with you guys
after I became boy toy

196
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,988
for the wrinkled,
but still flexible, Madonna.

197
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,759
What does your card say, Bernadette?

198
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,349
Hang on. Do you think
we'd really drift apart

199
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,039
if we both became successful?

200
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,434
Of course not.

201
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:48,072
If I became a famous actress
and had to move,

202
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:49,712
you would just come with me.

203
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,878
But if I get a chance
to be a tenured professor,

204
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:55,388
I might not have that much
choice in where | end up.

205
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,192
Yeah, but if I become
a successful actress,

206
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,799
we wouldn't need the money.

207
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,998
Well, you don't go
into science for the money.

208
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:02,348
Speak for yourself.

209

took me somewhere else,

212
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:16,948

Good luck.

Aren't you gonna come with me?

While you confront your mother
about her sex life?

225

I saw you having naked sex.

230
00:11:09,319 --> 00:11:10,672
What are you talking about?

231
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,916
Earlier, I came here to surprise you.

232
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,680
I looked in the window
and I saw you with a man.

233

Oh, Shelly, I'm so sorry.
Come in.

234
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:23,875
Um...

235
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:27,639
Maybe we should sit down
and talk about this.

236
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:31,347
Can you recommend a surface
you haven't had coitus on?

237
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,599
That's not funny.

238
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,472
Maybe we should sit at the table.

Well, I'm sure that you
have a lot of questions.

240
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,348
Who was he?

241
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,632
His name is Ron.
I met him at my prayer group.

242
00:12:00,999 --> 00:12:02,398
How long have you been
involved with him?

243
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,033
Afew months.

244
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,753
And of those few months,

245
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,758
how long have you been
a demented sex pervert?

246
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,196
That is no way
to speak to your mother.

247
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,708
Perhaps not.

248
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,115
But it is a way to speak
to a woman who quoted the Bible

In a minute.
I don't understand why any success

264
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,389
you have in acting is more important
than any I have in science.

265
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,272
Okay, if you do
something cool in science,

266
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:10,594
you might change the world.

stars are the best. Theyjust are.

269

I'm surprised you guys never
talked about this stuff.

270
00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:22,910
Like you and Sheldon have
everything figured out?

271
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,317
Actually, our relationship agreement
covers a wide array of scenarios,

272
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,034
including career changes,
financial instability,

what'll happen with any of us?

00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:44,068
I think you and Leonard
will be together.

-You do?
-Yeah.

278
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,477
I think you're
the best couple I know.

279
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,749
That's so sweet.

280
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,234
-What the hell?
-Excuse me?

281
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,956
Duh, duh, duh...
Let the dead man talk.

282
00:13:55,319 --> 00:13:56,513
So, why do you think that?

283
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,077
Well, lfeel like you guys
make each other better.

284

Penny brought Leonard
out of his shell.

285
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,028
And it seems like Leonard makes Penny
think more deeply about the world.

286
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,392
I don't know. Together, you two
kind of make one awesome person.

00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,679

I thought you were waiting
in the car.

go smoothly with your mom.

I'm not sure how we're going
to get past this.

302
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:00,157
You know, I sort of went
through something like this myself.

303
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,430
Howard, we've all seen
your mother naked.

304

That woman needs to learn
how to tie a robe.

305
00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:10,469
I'm talking about when
my mom started seeing someone

00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:12,635
a couple years after my dad left.

307
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:15,034
I didn't know she did.

308
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,710
Yeah, she was dating this guy,

309
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,310
and l was kind of ajerk
to her about it.

310
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,955
What did you do?

311
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:26,918
Let's just say
it was the most vicious

the history of Temple Beth El.

313
00:15:31,439 --> 00:15:33,555
Anyway, she broke up with him.

314
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,709
And she's basically
been alone ever since.

315
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,837
She never said it, but I always felt
I was the reason why.

316
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,679
I'm sorry.

317
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,358
Although, based on your story,

318
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,312
you absolutely were the reason why.

319
00:15:52,999 --> 00:15:54,478
All I'm saying is
you might not want

320
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,558
to get in the way
of your mom's happiness.

321
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,598
You may have a point.

322
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:03,273
I love my mother.

323
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,755
Even if she fornicates
like a demonic weasel.

324
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,839
And the healing begins.

325
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,754
-Hello.
-Hello.

326
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,633
Are you ready to discuss
this calmly, like adults?

327
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,394
I am.

328
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,120
Shelly, I'm sorry that
you saw what you saw.

329
00:16:41,319 --> 00:16:43,389
I know that this is hard for you.

330
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:47,390
I think what most upsets me
about it, Mother, is the hypocrisy.

331
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:49,233
Doesn't this contradict

332
00:16:49,439 --> 00:16:51,714
all the religious rules you've
been espousing your whole life?

333
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,558
You're right, it does,
and it's something

334
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,716
that I'm struggling
with these days.

335
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,319
Then why are you doing it?

336
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,192
Because I'm not perfect, Shelly.

337
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,959
And that man's booty is.

338
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:10,111
Well, this is confusing for me.

339
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,071
But I don't want to stand
in the way of your happiness.

340
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,157
So...

341
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:18,554
l'll condemn you internally
while maintaining

342
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:20,351
an outward appearance of acceptance.

343
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,909
That is very Christian of you.

344
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:30,590
Mother, if you're going
to conduct your life in this fashion,

345
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,473
then I should let you know
that the world has changed

346
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,113
since you were a young woman.

347
00:17:35,439 --> 00:17:39,068
You know, it's not all sock hops,
sodajerks and segregation anymore.

348
00:17:40,839 --> 00:17:42,511
How old do you think I am?

349
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:46,991
My point is that you're going
to need to be careful.

350
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,479
You used to be protected by your
pre-Enlightenment mythology,

351
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,954
but now you're going
to need a stronger friend

352
00:17:54,159 --> 00:17:55,512
named latex.

353
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:00,593
Are you having the sex talk with me?

354
00:18:01,439 --> 00:18:02,713
Well, someone has to.

355
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:04,796
Oh, dear Lord!

356
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,468
No, don't look to Him.
He's mad at you right now.

357
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,638
Come on, don't pout.
I'm sorry I ruined your game.

358
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,592
I'm not pouting, l'm brooding.

359
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,952
Which is how sexy men pout.

360
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:24,952
It actually was kind of fun.

361
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:26,478
You're just saying that.

362
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,833
Yeah.

363
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,559
I liked the time travel element.

364
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:34,192
Thank you.
I thought it was inspired.

365
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,118
It was. By Terminator:

366
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,909
Well, I hope 20 years from now,
we really are all still together

367
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,155
and still friends.

368
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,429
-Definitely.
-Of course.

369
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,834
Hey, how about this?

370
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,916
Whether we're friends, not friends,

371
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:47,871
scattered around the world,
no matter what,

372
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:49,717
let's all promise to meet
in front of this building

373
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,989
exactly 20 years
from tonight at 8:00 pm.

374
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:53,632
and have dinner
like we always do.

375
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:55,318
Aw, I love it.

376
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,995
Putting it in my phone right now.

377
00:18:57,199 --> 00:18:58,552
Yeah, me, too.

378
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:01,357
My phone doesn't have a calendar.

379
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:07,556
It's all right,
I'll just write it on my hand.

380
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,719
And it's done.

381
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:12,988
Yup, we're all in.

382
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,509
All right,
I'll see you guys in 20 years.

383
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,319
I knew it.

384
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:50,591
