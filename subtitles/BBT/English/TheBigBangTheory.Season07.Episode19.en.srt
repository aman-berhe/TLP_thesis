between getting an Xbox One or a PS4.

Oh, "pee." Why'd I say that?

a stupid question,

-Yeah, sure.
-Of course.

27
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,270

make me look like a lovable goof

in our office who's retiring,

00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:55,034
and they were passing around one of
those big cards for us to sign...

No one told me she was in a horrible
car accident over the weekend

35
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,830
and what I was signing
was not a retirement card

36

aka PS1,

then PS2, PS3 and now PS4.

88
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,475
And that makes sense.

89
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,035
You'd think after Xbox,
there'd be Xbox 2.

90
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,789
But no, next came Xbox 360. Hm?

91
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:34,837
And now, after 360, comes Xbox One.

92
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:37,229
Why "One"?

93
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,435
Maybe that's how many seconds
of thought they put into naming it.

Can you get the butter, please?

95
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,594
You know, however,
with the Xbox One,

96
00:04:45,799 --> 00:04:47,915
I can control
my entire entertainment system

97
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,439
using voice commands.

98
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,517

I've had to use Leonard.

99
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:55,156
Then get the other one.

00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,192

-(MOCK|NG) No way.
-Yeah.

106
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,793
It's true. But the larger size
of the Xbox One

107
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,194
may keep it from overheating.

108
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,516
You wouldn't want
your gaming system to overheat.

109
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,472
Well, you absolutely would not.

110
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,195
And furthermore, the Xbox One
now comes with a Kinect included.

111
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:25,151
-lncluded?
-Yes!

112
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:27,718
Not sold separately.

113
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,992
Although, the PS4
uses cool new GDDR5 RAM,

114
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:35,077
while the Xbox One is still using
the conventional DDR3 memory.

115
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,998
Why would they still
be using DDR3?

116
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:38,598
Are they nuts?

117
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,593
See? That's what I thought.

118
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:44,154
But then they go and throw in
an ESRAM buffer.

119
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:47,271
-Whoa. Wait a second. Who's "they"?
-Xbox.

120
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,789
-You're kidding!
-No, I am not!

121
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,036
And this ESRAM buffer
should totally bridge

122
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,798
the 100-gigabit-per-second
bandwidth gap

123
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,035
between the two RAM types.

124
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,470
This is a nightmare.
How will you ever make a decision?

125
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,591
I don't know!
What should I do?

126
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,518
Please pass the butter!

127
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,915

00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:38,075
Penny, two of the brightest stars
in the night sky

176
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,430
are Altair and Vega.

177
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:42,834
And it is said
they were deeply in love

178
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:47,079
but forever separated by the
celestial river of the Milky Way.

179
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,999
-That's sad.
-It is.

180
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,350
But once a year,

181
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,028
on the seventh day
of the seventh month,

182
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,392
Vega cries so hard that all
the magpies in the world fly up

183
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,752
and create a bridge with their wings
so the two lovers can be together

184
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,633
for a single night of passion.

185
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,507
Wow.

186
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,788
Okay, that's enough.

187
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,995
Quick poll: PS4 or Xbox One?
Raj.

188
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,269
-Xbox One.
-Penny.

189
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,390
Huh?

190
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,668
-Leonard.
-PS4.

191
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:26,471
-Wolowitz.
-Both great.

192
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,477
-Bernadette.
-I like the Wii.

193
00:09:31,439 --> 00:09:32,792
Thanks, Grandma.

194
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,073
-Oh, my goodness.
-What's up?

195
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,635
ljust got an email
from my ex-girlfriend Lucy.

196
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,273
She misses me
and wants to get together.

197
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,029
Two women at the same time?
Nicejob, playa!

198
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,395
Really?

199
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:53,592
Was it the "two women"
thing or the "playa"?

200
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,672
It was the "playa".

201
00:10:00,999 --> 00:10:02,114
What am I supposed to do?

202
00:10:02,319 --> 00:10:04,879
How am I supposed to choose
between Emily and Lucy?

203
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:07,035
Why do you have to choose?
Date both of them.

204
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,196
I can't date two women at once.

205
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:11,310
Zero women, that's my sweet spot.

206
00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:14,427
Unless you're sleeping
with one of them,

207
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:16,038
seeing other people isn't a big deal.

208
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,879
But what if one of them asks me
what I was up to the night before

209
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:21,718
and l was with the other one?
Then, what, do I lie?

210
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,558
-Yes.
-Yes.

211
00:10:25,999 --> 00:10:26,988
What do you mean, yes?

212
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,599
What do you mean, yes?

213
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,756
Were you seeing other women
when we started dating?

214
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,358
No. Were you seeing other men?

215
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,629
No.

216
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,829
Were you seeing other men?

217
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,189
No.

218
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,039
Aren't you gonna ask me?

219
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,793
Come on, really?

220
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,876
Thank you so much
for letting us pick your brain.

221
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,070
Yeah, happy to help.
So, what's going on?

222
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,999
Well, I'm having an impossible time
getting my career off the ground,

223
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:59,235
and I got offered a role
in this crappy horror movie,

224
00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:00,792
and ljust don't know
if I should take it.

225
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,312
Well, l have certainly taken some
jobs that I've been embarrassed by.

226
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:07,033
I wouldn't exactly call
Star Trek embarrassing.

227
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,713
I wasn't.

228
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,439
Me, either.

229
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:19,236
So, what do you think, is there a
professional downside to doing it?

230
00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:20,667
Well, it's tricky.

231
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:23,393
You want to take projects
that you're excited about,

232
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,716
but sometimes you also
have to pay the bills.

233
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:28,231
When you're on the set
working on something

234
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:31,590
that you just know in your heart
is bad, not Star Trek...

235
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,430
Yeah, beam me up. I love it!

236
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,991
Anyway, those jobs
can be soul-crushing.

237
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,792
That's what I'm afraid of.

238
00:11:42,999 --> 00:11:44,751
Well, l was in Stand By Me
when l was a kid,

239
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,359
and it was a huge success.

240
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,994
The terrible movies I did
came after that.

241
00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:50,757
Imagine how that feels.

242
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,870
Sounds rough.

243
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,196
I'm telling you,
this business is brutal.

244
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,278
To this day,
I hate going on auditions.

245
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,632
Okay, lwalk in, and I can just
feel them thinking,

246
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,751
"He was such a cute kid.
What happened to him?"

247
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,908
And then I don't get the job,
and I can never find out why.

248
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,914
Honestly, I get so depressed,
there are entire weeks

249
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,270
that I can't even get out of bed.

250
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:21,793
Okay, this was helpful.

251
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:28,029
Any news on your co-worker
who's in the hospital?

252
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,038
Poor thing,
she was in surgery for 18 hours.

253
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,151
She's alive, but she's
still in critical condition.

254
00:12:33,359 --> 00:12:34,394
Oh, no.

255
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:35,827
The one bit of good news
is they put her

256
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,951
in a medically induced coma
before she read the card.

257
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:40,070
So, you know, silver linings.

258
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:45,550
Were you like this
when I married you?

259
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:50,477
Don't worry about it, buddy.

260
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,671
-Okay, bye.
-(PHONE BEEPS)

261
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,319
That was Wil,
he's feeling a lot better.

262
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,557
Apparently, he's 12-down
in the TV Guide crossword puzzle.

263
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,232
Did he help you make a decision
about the movie?

264
00:13:01,439 --> 00:13:04,192
No. Did you figure out what you're
gonna do about the two girls?

265
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,799
As a matter of fact, I did.

266
00:13:05,999 --> 00:13:08,513
I've spent so many years
living in fear,

267
00:13:08,719 --> 00:13:11,153
saying no to new experiences,
but from now on,

268
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,351
I'm gonna say yes.
Yes to love,

269
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,312
yes to adventure, yes to life.
Whatever it may be,

270
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,953
the answer's going to be yes.

271
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,349
He's gonna die alone, right?

272
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,913
-Yeah.
-Yes.

273
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,994
I'm proud of you, Sheldon.

274
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,553
You know, I'm proud of me, too.

275
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:29,910
I've done all my research,
I conducted an informal poll,

276
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,712
and I've arrived
at the rock-solid certainty

277
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:32,988
I've made the right choice.

278
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,428
Well, that's got to be
a good feeling.

279
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,914
Oh, it is.

280
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,792
-Although--
-Oh, crap.

281
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,597
I had the same feeling when
I made my dad buy a Betamax

282
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,358
instead of a VHS.

283
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,278
You were just a little kid.

284
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,708
A little kid
who picked the wrong format

285
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,672
to record The MacNeiI/Lehrer Report.

286
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,679
I also was certain that HD DVD
would win out over Blu-ray.

287
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,791
-How old were you then?
-Old enough to know better.

288
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,992
And now that I think about it,
I stood in front of a case of iPods

289
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,791
and I bought a Zune.

290
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,155
What's a Zune?

291
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,873
Yeah, exactly.

292
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,392
It's an MP3 player
brought to us by the makers of Xbox.

293
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,711
No, what are you doing?
No, pick that back up.

294
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,751
You know it's good.
You did the research.

295
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,187
But what if I'm wrong?

296
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,998
You know what?
How about | buy it for you?

297
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,349
How about | buy you both?

298
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,838
You know I only have
one slot available

299
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,155
on my entertainment center.

300
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,112
Then I'll buy you
a new entertainment center.

301
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,993
Yeah, okay, sure.
But which one?

302
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:42,276
How about this?
I've heard that if you flip a coin,

303
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,038
it will tell you how
you actually feel.

304
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,514
Because you'll either
be disappointed

305
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,278
or excited by the outcome.

306
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,435
Interesting.

307
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,712
So, heads it's PS4,
tails it's Xbox One.

308
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,598
All right, I'll try.

309
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,909
What is it?

310
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,599
A quarter.

311
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,555
Could have given it back to me.
That was a choice.

312
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,836
(SIGHS)

313
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,557
You look really pretty tonight.

314
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,830
Thanks. I love thatjacket.

315
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,473
Thank you. Thanks.

316
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,038
I'm sorry. I can't do this.

317
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,152
My ex-girlfriend emailed me,
and I'm seeing her Saturday.

318
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:31,589
And I'm glad you like it,
it's from J. Crew.

319
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:35,028
I don't understand.

320
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,595
My friends told me it was okay to see
more than one person at a time,

321
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,234
but it feels like
I'm being deceitful.

322
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,872
Are you getting
back together with her?

323
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,191
No. l have no idea.
What would you do?

324
00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:50,197
Usually on first dates,
| talk about music and stuff,

325
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,719
but I was promised weird,
so let's do this.

326
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,798
How serious were you two?

327
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,078
Well, to be honest,

328
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:01,316
we only went on four dates,
hugged twice, kissed once,

329
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,352
and there was a handshake
loaded with sexual innuendo.

330
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,469
Wait, a girl you never slept with
sent you an email

331
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,148
and you felt so guilty about it
that you had to tell me?

332
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,634
Yeah.

333
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:17,153
That's kind of adorable.

334
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:20,913
Are you sure?
Because this is the part of the night

335
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,315
where I've said something stupid
and the girl usually leaves.

336
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,918
I'm still here.

337
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,509
Yeah, but now you make me wonder
what's wrong with you.

338
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,028
We just met.

339
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,549
You don't need to tell me about
other people you're seeing.

340
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,439
Really?

341
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,198
Because "I'm dating two women"

342
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:40,471
is basically the only cool thing
I can say about myself.

343
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,279
(BOTH LAUGHING)

344
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:54,595
On the one hand, the Xbox One
has a better camera,

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,268
but the PS4 has
a removable hard drive.

346
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,708
Thoughts?

347
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,473
I can't feel my legs.

348
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,395
Oh...

349
00:17:06,479 --> 00:17:08,595
I'm sorry, guys, but the store
closed five minutes ago.

350
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:11,072
But I haven't decided yet.

351
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:13,588
You'll have to come back tomorrow.
The registers are closed.

353
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,072
Let's get you some food.
You'll feel better after you eat.

354
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:22,917
Okay.

355
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,749
What do you want like, Thai food?
A burger?

356
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,791
(SCREAMING)
I don't know!

357
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,998
SHELDON: Hey, look, a quarter!

358
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:51,234
How's that feel?

359
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,556
Great.
Not like regret at all.

360
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,108
Penny?

361
00:17:58,959 --> 00:17:59,869
We're working together!

362
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:02,389
Awesome!
