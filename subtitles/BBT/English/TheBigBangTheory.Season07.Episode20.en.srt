gravity wave discovery,
the more excited I get.

3
00:00:08,479 --> 00:00:10,151
I know. Being an
astrophysicist right now

4
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:11,394
is like being a rock star.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,113
Only without the sex.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,358
Yeah, literally, none of it.

7
00:00:17,999 --> 00:00:19,273
What do you think about it, Sheldon?

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,879
Meh.

9
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,798
Are you kidding me?

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,911
This may be the biggest
scientific breakthrough

11
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,109
of our lifetime.

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,471
How can you, as a theoretical
physicist, not care about this?

13
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,510
Maybe it's because
I'm not an elitist.

14
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:32,834
What I'd like to know is:

15
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:34,791
How does this gravity wave
breakthrough

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,513
help the man on the street?
You know?

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,357
Who's looking out
for Joe Six-Pack

18
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,790
and all his quantum physics concerns?

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,468
Oh, my God, you're jealous.

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,477
Why would I bejealous?

21
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,830
I don't know. Maybe because
the origin of the universe

22
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:50,553
just got proven,
the Higgs field just got proven

23
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,228
and you've been working on
string theory for the last 20 years

24
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:55,748
and you're no closer to proving
it than when you started.

25
00:00:56,839 --> 00:00:58,557
Yeah, well, I've had a lot
on my plate.

26
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,234

-Excuse me, fellas.

28
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,558
Sorry for eavesdropping,
but there actually was

29
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:10,637
some big string theory news today
out of the Hadron Collider.

30
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,990
Really?
Did they find evidence to support

31
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:14,837
extra dimensions
or supersymmetry?

32
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:18,668
No, but they did find evidence
that you'll believe anything.

33
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:21,787
Why would you do that?

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,831
You're a string theorist as well.

35
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,634
lncorrect.
I am a string pragmatist.

36
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,035
I say I'm gonna prove something
that cannot be proved,

37
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,434
| apply for grant money,

38
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,710
and then I spend it
on liquor and broads.

39
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,592
Later.

40
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,590
Do you think he's right?

41
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,718
Am I wasting my life on atheory
that can never be proven?

42
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,950
Maybe. But how great
is Game of Thrones?

No, that's not it.

48
00:02:25,359 --> 00:02:26,758
Is something bothering you?

49
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,599
Yes, but you wouldn't understand.

Come on, try me.

51
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,637
All right.

of my life to string theory

...I know what it's like to put your
heart and soul into something

58
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,519
and get nothing out of it.

59
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,599
You mean your acting career?

60
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,240
-No.
-Your relationship with Leonard?

61
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,675
No.

62
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,199
Your failed attempt
to go back to college?

63
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,753
No!

64
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,954
I'm saying you and string theory
sound like a relationship,

65
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,195
and I know what it's like
to be in one

66
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,550
and realize it's never gonna
turn out the way you want.

67
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:18,596
I said Leonard, you said no.

68
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:21,550
I'm talking about other guys.

69
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,435
OK. Well, what do you do?

70
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,949
You have to have the courage
to end the relationship.

71
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,832
You know? Break it off,
shake hands, walk away.

72
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:34,675
I don't know if I can do that.

Break it off,
shake hands, walk away.

77
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,399
Hey, how's dating two women going?

78
00:03:56,599 --> 00:03:58,590
Um, kind of hit a bump.

79
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,471
When I was honest and told Emily

80
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,796
she wasn't the only person
I was seeing, it went great.

81
00:04:02,999 --> 00:04:04,512
So I tried the same thing with Lucy.

82
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,712
-And?
-She had mixed feelings.

83
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,075
But when I said,
"Emily was cool with it.

84
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:13,190
Emily's the best. Why can't you
be more like Emily?"...

85
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:18,197
...those feelings
became less mixed.

86
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:23,067
Women. Who knows what'll set 'em off?

87
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,833
At least now I can focus all
my energies on just one girl.

88
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,758
I hope I get to meet her
as soon as possible.

89
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,473
Why the rush?
She isn't going anywhere.

90
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,830
She is. But I like that attitude.

91
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:38,314
Gentlemen, is anybody interested
in my old string theory books?

92
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:40,032
You're really going to do this?

93
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,151
I am. Yeah, Penny pointed out

94
00:04:42,359 --> 00:04:44,919
that what I'm going through
is essentially a breakup.

95
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,714
And according
to Cosmopolitan magazine,

96
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,956
one of the most effective
techniques for moving on

97
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,594
is to get rid of all reminders
of the relationship.

98
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,950
-You're reading Cosmo?
-Yes.

99
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,912
As it turns out, there's an article

100
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,839
on how to get over a breakup
in literally every issue.

101
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,035
Anyway, it suggests
that I set these on fire,

102
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,151
but the smell of burning books

103
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:09,032
reminds me of church picnics
in East Texas.

104
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,439
What's this?

105
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,110
That's just a doodle of
a hyperelliptic Riemann surface.

106
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:19,072
Oh, yeah. Wasn't that the basis
of your postdoc fellowship?

107
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,508
It was.

108
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,029
This seemed so elegant
at the time,

109
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,232
but now I realize I wasjust
a simple country boy,

110
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,795
seduced by a big city theory

111
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,195
with variables
in all the right places.

112
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,950
-lt's going to be OK.
-I know.

113
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,071
As hard as this is,
l have to move on.

114
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:39,839
I can't keep postulating
multidimensional entities

115
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,598
and get nothing in return.

116
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,439
l have needs, too.

117
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,238
So, you and Emily
still together?

118
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:59,949
I spoke to Bernadette.
She's free tomorrow night.

119
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,149
OK, great.

120
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,555
But if we're really gonna do
a double date,

121
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,796
then we have to go over
some ground rules about Emily.

122
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,956
Like when it turns out
she's made of rubber,

123
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,388
I don't say anything?

124
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:12,758
She's very real.

125
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,951
That's what it says on the box.

126
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,996
Right next to "dishwasher safe."

127
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,151
See? This is exactly
the kind of thing

128
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:24,031
I'm worried about you
saying in front of her.

129
00:06:24,239 --> 00:06:26,070
I promise I'll be
on my best behavior.

130
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,636
You better be. No jokes about
how close I am with my dog.

131
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,116
Or the truth about how close
I am with my dog.

132
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,599
You got it.

133
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:36,357
No jokes about
the year I took ballet.

134
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,039
You took ballet?

135
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:40,917
God, you never listen.

136
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,671
Are you sure you
want to do this?

137
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,189
The magazine articles suggest
that one of the ways

138
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:50,549
to get over a breakup
is a new look.

139
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,469
What about your old look,
well-groomed ventriloquist doll?

140
00:06:56,719 --> 00:06:59,187
-"Oh, my God, I do look like that."
-Stop it!

141
00:07:01,799 --> 00:07:03,676
So, how do you want me
to cut it?

142
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,793
How about Bill Gates
meets Nikola Tesla?

143
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:11,718
So, business in the front,
science in the back.

144
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,116
Or I don't cut it and
maybe just style it a little.

145
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:16,593
I'm in your hands.

146
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,951
Do a good job and I'll tell you
Cosmo's ten dynamite tips

147
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,957
to enjoy your PMS.

148
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,235
Can you keep him quiet?

149
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,634
Maybe jangle some keys
in front of him?

150
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,955
That doesn't work anymore.

151
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,276
Hejust thinks I'm taking him
to the doctor.

152
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:33,473
So, now that you're
no longer invested in string theory,

153
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,999
what are you gonna pursue?

154
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,997
There are so
many exciting areas:

155
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,668
black holes, dark matter...

156
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,438
Leonard was telling me
about dark matter,

157
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:42,754
but I didn't really understand it.

158
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,428
Don't feel bad.
Neither does he.

159
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,072
OK...

160
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,391
...what do you think?

161
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,475
Have you ever even seen
a picture of Tesla?

162
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,193
It actually looks good, Sheldon.

163
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,151
-Doesn't it?
-Yeah.

164
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,108
I suppose I could see myself
in a scientific boy band.

165
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,429
Of course, I'd be the dreamy one
and the smart one.

166
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:12,553
Sorry I'm late.

167
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,398
-What did you do?
-I gave him a new look.

168
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,036
-lt's cute, huh?
-Yeah, it's cute. That's the problem.

169
00:08:20,239 --> 00:08:22,275
I don't need other girls
to see him walking around

170
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,993
like sex on a stick.

171
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,431
She's right. I'm too hot.

172
00:08:33,199 --> 00:08:34,757
I'm excited to meet Emily.

173
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:37,632
Me, too. ljust hope
he doesn't blow it.

174
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,067
Why would you say that?

175
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,875
Because he's Raj.
That's his thing.

176
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,918
Beckham can bend it,
Ralph can wreck it, Raj can blow it.

177
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:49,157
Look, I don't want it to happen,

178
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,590
but odds are he's gonna
find a way to...

179
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,438
Oh, crap, I know that girl.

180
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:57,790
-How?
-In a bad way, very bad.

181
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,035
Hey, guys.

182
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,639
Whatever you hear tonight,
just remember I love you.

183
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,875
Hey!

184
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,319
Emily, these are my good
friends, Howard and Bernadette.

185
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,350
-Guys, this is Emily.
-Nice to meet you.

186
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,675
-Hi.
-Hello.

187
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:14,392
Have we met before?

188
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,799
No.

189
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,836
I don't...
I don't... think so.

190
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,393
You sure? You look familiar.

191
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,670
Well, you sure don't.

192
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,269
You I know,
you I know, you?

193
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,357
Total stranger.

194
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,394
Even if you had yummy candy,
I would not get in your van.

195
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:36,236
Did you go to that spin class
on Green Street?

196
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,032
That must be it.

197
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,356
Since when do you go to spin class?

198
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,517
Wow. Now who doesn't listen?

199
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,628
Sheldon, your food's getting cold.
What are you doing?

200
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,627
Looking through my textbooks
for a new field of inquiry.

201
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,513
Why do we have a geology book?

202
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,678
Leonard, did you throw
a children's party

203
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:59,153
while I was in Texas?

204
00:10:00,439 --> 00:10:01,918
Wait. What's wrong with geology?

205
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,509
Let me put this in away
you'll understand, Penny.

206
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,312
You remember
how you explained to me

207
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,431
that the Kardashians
aren't real celebrities?

208
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,189
Well, geology
is the Kardashians of science.

209
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,989
Have you considered
studying standard model physics?

210
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,917
You want me
to give up string theory

211
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,917
for something
that's less advanced?

212
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,235
You know, why don't you break up
with Penny

213
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:24,430
and start dating a brown bear.

214
00:10:25,999 --> 00:10:28,752
Like you could
get a brown bear.

215
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,392
Hey, I've got a good job.

216
00:10:30,599 --> 00:10:32,317
I could buy salmon.
You don't know.

217
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,558
Maybe you could make
your new field of study

218
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:37,238
the calculation
of nuclear matrix elements.

219
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,475
Oh, please.

220
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,752
If I wanted to take up a fad,
I'd get a tramp stamp.

221
00:10:45,439 --> 00:10:47,236
What about loop quantum gravity?

222
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,111
Oh, Duchess, look at me!

223
00:10:49,319 --> 00:10:52,072
My quantum gravity's
positively loopy!

224
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,119
Who's the duchess?

225
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,992
One of the people
that lives in his head.

226
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,949
I hope he's this distraught
if he ever breaks up with me.

227
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,628
Well, if he does, I'll see
if my bear has a friend.

228
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,555
Sheldon, have you ever considered
not rushing into something new?

229
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:11,114
I mean, why don't you
take your time, enjoy your freedom?

230
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,198
Maybe something new
to study will find you.

231
00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:17,236
That's actually not bad advice.

232
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,749
You know, I didn't seek out
string theory.

233
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,229
It just hit me
over the head one day.

234
00:11:22,439 --> 00:11:23,474
How does that happen?

235
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,796
A bully chased me through
the school library

236
00:11:25,999 --> 00:11:28,593
and hit me over the head with
the biggest book he could find.

237
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,389
OK, how about we toast
your newfound freedom?

238
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,630
Normally I refrain from alcohol,

239
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,718
but since my cerebral cortex is
twiddling its proverbial thumbs,

240
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,512
why not soak it in grape juice

241
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,870
that's been predigested
by a fungus?

242
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,873
And you wonder why other
children beat you with books.

243
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:48,194
Cheers!

244
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,717
Emily, what do you do?

245
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,070
I'm a dermatology resident
at Huntington Hospital.

246
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,872
And you know what that means.

247
00:11:57,079 --> 00:12:00,469
Someone's skin's about
to be softer than ever.

248
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:04,637
This is making me crazy.
I know I know you from somewhere.

249
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:07,831
Howard was an astronaut.
Maybe that's where you saw him.

250
00:12:07,999 --> 00:12:11,150
Wow, that's amazing.
What was that like?

251
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,999
It was the most incredible
experience of my life.

252
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:16,759
Up there
in the space station, you're...

253
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,791
Oh, my God, I remember.

254
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,751
Can I finish my astronaut story?

255
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,154
It was four years ago.

256
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,157
-Please don't say it.
-We were set up on a blind date.

257
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,918
-Please don't say it.
-You came to my apartment.

258
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,951
You're saying it.

259
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,553
Well, what happened?

260
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:32,477
-Yeah, what happened?
-OK, I'll say it.

261
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,837
(CLEARS THROAT)
l was on the way to pick her up.

262
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,917
My stomach felt a little funny.

263
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,032
When I got there, I asked
if I could use her bathroom.

264
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,958
Please don't say it.

265
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,789
One roll of toilet paper
and 20 minutes later,

266
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:51,194
lwas so humiliated,

267
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:53,959
lsnuck out the window
and never saw her again.

268
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,513
You know what else
I never saw again:

269
00:12:55,719 --> 00:12:57,630
my security deposit.

270
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,273
I'm sorry.

271
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,278
I tried to unclog it,
but you didn't have a plunger,

272
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,879
and water was
spilling out everywhere.

273
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,593
Right, just water.

274
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,796
Look, l have felt terrible
about this for years,

275
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:13,787
and I'm glad I have the opportunity
to tell you just how sorry I am.

276
00:13:13,999 --> 00:13:15,876
It's fine.

277
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,478
All my friends love this story.

278
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,671
They call you Clogzilla.

279
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,029
Get it? Because you
clogged up her bathroom

280
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,674
like a radioactive monster!

281
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,115
-Yeah, yeah, I get it.
-Howie.

282
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,754
Well, hey, it's not like
cotton candy comes out of you.

283
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,710
Come on, let's get you to bed.
You've had a lot to drink.

284
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,239
No more than Penny.

285
00:13:37,439 --> 00:13:39,191
That's what I'm saying.

286
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,397
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait...

287
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,198
Empty room.

288
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,878
Empty room.

289
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,468
Empty room.

290
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,750
If somebody says "Come in,"
I'm gonna freak out.

291
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,039
So, Emily, why did you decide
to specialize in dermatology?

292
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,117
I like cutting people with knives,

293
00:14:01,319 --> 00:14:04,675
and all the otherjobs where
you get to do that are illegal.

294
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,276
You're kidding, right?

295
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,759
(CHUCKLING)

296
00:14:11,439 --> 00:14:14,272
She's scary,
but it's a cute scary.

297
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,355
Can I sayjust one more thing?

298
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,028
I had some kind
of food poisoning that day.

299
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,754
Sure, in retrospect,
gas station sushi...

300
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:23,233
maybe not the best choice.

301
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,113
Nor was climbing out
your window and running away.

302
00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:28,833
But I think we can all understand
how humiliating that was,

303
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:30,267
and I'd really appreciate it
if we could move on.

304
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,198
Howie, we moved on
a long time ago.

305
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,550
-l'm just saying--
-We moved on.

306
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,548
OK. Fine.

307
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,357
-How's your soup?
-lt's all right.

308
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,278
They could've filled
the bowl a little more.

309
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,714
(STIFLING LAUGHTER)

310
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,559
-Excuse me.
-Where are you going?

311
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:54,557
-I need some fresh air.
-Been there.

312
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,591
Oh, no.

313
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,756
What have I done?

314
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,636
How you feeling?

315
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:45,868
Not so good.

316
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,558
Are you gonna introduce me
to your friend?

317
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:53,472
It's not my friend.

318
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,557
Nothing happened.

319
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,957
I don't know, I heard you reading
pretty loud last night.

320
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,550
Oh, dear Lord.

321
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,715
Where's Amy?

322
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,797
After she put you to bed,
she went home.

323
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,790
Oh.

324
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,910
I should call her and apologize.

325
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,591
-Oh, no.
-What?

326
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,429
Apparently, I called
Stephen Hawking last night.

327
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,591
FEMALE VOICE:
First new message.

328
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,472
SHELDON: Hawkman!

329
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:30,636
It's your old buddy
Sheldonoscopy!

330
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,995
How come you didn't
pick up the phone?

331
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,589
Oh, right. My bad.

332
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,236
You're awful quiet.
Everything OK?

333
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,678
Not really.

334
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,791
I had a bit
of an embarrassing evening.

335
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,116
Me, too. What happened?

336
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,038
I drank alcohol

337
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,791
and may have left an unfortunate
voice mail for Stephen Hawking.

338
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,153
I wouldn't worry about it.

339
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,191
He's got a pretty good
sense of humor.

340
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,918
I hope so.

341
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,997
What happened to you
last night?

342
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,918
Well, turns out

343
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,588
I'd already met the girl
Raj is seeing

344
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,235
when I did a number
on her bathroom.

345
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:19,031
And that number was two.

346
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,239
Well, you know,
I've always been a fan

347
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:27,112
of a story told
by Attar of Nishapur,

348
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:31,028
about a king,
who assembled a group of wise men

349
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,710
to create a ring that would
make him happy when he was sad.

350
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:38,070
And that ring was inscribed
with the phrase,

351
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:40,235
"This, too, shall pass."

352
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,235
-Hey, Cooper!
-Oh, my God.

353
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,750
I heard you drunk-dialed
Stephen Hawking last night?

354
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,518
Classic!

355
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,755

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,678
Whatever you say...

357
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,030
...Clogzilla.

358
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,118
Clogzilla. That's pretty funny.

359
00:18:02,199 --> 00:18:04,349
I don't think that's gonna pass.

360

364
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,513

solve crimes together!
