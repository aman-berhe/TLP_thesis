1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,078
So, we're about to shoot
this scene in the movie

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,113
where the killer ape DNA
is slowly taking over my body.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,309
Okay.

4
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,956
But I realize they're gluing fur
everywhere except my cleavage.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,230
So, I asked the director why
and he says,

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,873
"It's important
to the story that my boobs

7
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:19,274
be the last things to turn ape."

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,759
lt's sweet that he thinks
there's a story.

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,348
Oh, and there's not
even a bathroom on set.

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,630
I had to go to the gas station
across the street.

11
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:31,397
I mean, lwas dressed
like half an ape

12
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,318
and still not even close to the
most disgusting person in there.

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,111
Leonard, I could use
your assistance.

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,753
-Sure. What's up?
-Well, now that I've given up

15
00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:42,235
string theory, I'm struggling
to find my next area of focus.

16
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:43,997
In your professional opinion,

17
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:46,667
which of these areas do you think
is the most promising?

18
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,917
Well, I think there's some
really innovative stuff

19
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,236
-going on in dark matter.
-That's helpful.

20
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,477
-Okay, of these four areas--
-Sheldon!

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,830
What did we say about
being a nicer friend?

22
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,597
-Thank you.
-Leonard, what did we say

23
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:04,437
about being a gullible weenie?

24
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,189
-It is just so frustrating.
-'Cause you're trying too hard.

25
00:01:08,399 --> 00:01:10,037
You need to do something else.
Get your mind off it.

26
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,391
Hey, how about we bring back
Anything Can Happen Thursdays?

27
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,238
Hey, that's good.
Why'd you guys stop doing that?

28
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,112
You made fun of us.
Said it was stupid.

29
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,554
Yeah. Sounds like me.

30
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,789
Come on, Sheldon.
What do you say?

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,993
All right. I officially reinstate
Anything Can Happen Thursday.

32
00:01:26,199 --> 00:01:27,791
Great!
What do you want to do?

33
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,428
I don't know.
What do you want to do?

34
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,437
I don't know.
What do you want to do?

35
00:01:34,919 --> 00:01:37,353
I'm starting to remember the problem
with Anything Can Happen Thursdays.

36
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,432
J“ (THEME SONG PLAYING) J“

37
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:03,591
SHELDON: Hmm.

38
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,310
What could we do that's fun?

39
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,078
What could we do that's different?

40
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,874
What could we do that's free?

41
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:15,678
Got it! We order a pizza.

42
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,394
Are you kidding? That's what you
always do. Think harder.

43
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,478
You're right. You're right.
Got it!

44
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,878
We order calzones, cut them open,
eat them like pizza.

45
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,515
All right! All right!
l'll shake the brain bush one more time,

46
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:31,596
see what falls out.

47
00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:34,677
Got it! There's a live-action
role-playing group

48
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,711
that meets every Thursday night
in Griffith Park

49
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:39,479
and reenacts battles
from Lord of the Rings.

50
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,911
Okay, tell me more
about this calzone idea.

51
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,430
You know what?
Why don't we just ease into this.

52
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,029
Let's go for a walk
and see if we find a new restaurant.

53
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,754
Any chance that restaurant
is near Griffith Park?

54
00:02:56,679 --> 00:02:58,795
-No.
-All right.

55
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,797
Raj and Howard
are at Howard's moms,

56
00:03:01,999 --> 00:03:03,478
but should we call the girls
and see if they want to come?

57
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,830
-No. Bernadette's working late.
-Amy's sick.

58
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,349
-What's wrong with her?
-Well, she talks a lot.

59
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,152
She always wants to hold hands.

60
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,918
That's not what I meant.

61
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,633
Well, if you were
referring to her illness,

62
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,432
your question should have been,
"What ails her?"

63
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,878
-What ails her?
-Oh. Who knows?

64
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:25,109
Come on, anything can happen.
We can push him down the stairs!

65
00:03:27,279 --> 00:03:29,315
Hey. Thanks for coming to hang out.

66
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:30,952
No problem. How's your mom feeling?

67
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,277
Okay, but she'd feel better
if she took her medicine.

68
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,232
You know, when Cinnamon
won't take her medicine,

69
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:37,918
| hide it in a piece of cheese.

70
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,951
Good idea.
We can wrap the pill in cheese,

71
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,195
feed it to Cinnamon,
and then my mom can eat Cinnamon.

72
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,274
-What do you feel like doing?
-I was thinking we could watch a DVD.

73
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,870
Well, my mom doesn't have
a lot to choose from.

74
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,039
Unless you want to watch
the video of her colonoscopy.

75
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,634
Spoiler alert: 20 minutes in,
they find a prune pit.

76
00:04:01,279 --> 00:04:05,511
Actually, how do you feel about
watching House of 1000 Corpses?

77
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,757
A straight-up gore-fest?
You hate this stuff.

78
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,837
I do, but for some reason,
Emily loves it

79
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,234
and wants to watch it
with me tomorrow,

80
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,873
so I thought if
I saw it with you first,

81
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:16,309
then I could act cool
about it with her.

82
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,272
That's actually not a bad plan.

83
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:20,037
I can sit through
the colonoscopy now,

84
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,152
but that first time l was like,
(HIGH-PITCHED) "Oh, my God, a prune pit!"

85
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,431
-So you'd watch it?
-Sure.

86
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,277
You're a good friend.
I owe you one.

87
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,075
MRS. WOLOWITZ: Howard!
Help me get out of the tub!

88
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,112
Not that one.

89
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,909
So we're just randomly
choosing a restaurant

90
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,076
-without researching it online?
-Yep.

91
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,633
Great.

92
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,512
This is how Anything Can
Happen Thursday turns

93
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,551
into It Won't Stop Coming Out Friday.

94
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,798
Hey, how about
that Asian fusion place?

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,116
Fusion and Asians?

96
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,992
I'm trying not to
think about science.

97
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,388
What the hell?

98
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,951
What... she's not working late!

99
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,676
-And Amy doesn't look sick.
-Why would they lie to us?

100
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:17,073
That's a good question.

101
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,955
Amy and Bernadette.

102
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,758
(KNOCKING)
Amy and Bernadette.

103
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,597
(KNOCKING)
Amy and Bernadette.

104
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,791
Why did you lie to us?

105
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,914
Hey. Listen to this.

106
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,034
"Murder, cannibalism
and satanic rituals

107
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:37,709
are just a few of the thousand-plus
horrors that await."

108
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,638
ljust helped my mom
out of the tub,

109
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,354
so I'm one slippery horror
ahead of you.

110
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,552
You're a good son.
I don't know how you do it.

111
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,877
Beach blankets, my friend.
It's all about beach blankets.

112
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,913
All right,
let's get this over with.

113
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,588
Ew!
It's got someone's hair on it!

114
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,636
Oh, yeah, you're gonna
do great with this movie.

115
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,396
(BLOWS)

116
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,034
You're not working late.
Why did you lie to me?

117
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,275
And Amy, you told me you were sick,

118
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,357
but you look just as pale
and tired as always.

119
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,353
I'm sorry.
ljust needed a break

120
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:15,312
from hearing you obsess about
what to do after string theory.

121
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:18,111
And we kind ofjust wanted one night
where we didn't have to hear

122
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,311
about how miserable you are
making this movie.

123
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,231
But none of that means
we don't love you.

124
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,749
I haven't been complaining
that much about the movie.

125
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,029
Have I?

126
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:30,354
I also love you.

127
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:37,556
You know what?
Maybe I need a break from all of you.

128
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,876
-Come on, Sheldon.
-Where are we going?

129
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:41,558
We're gonna have
Anything Can Happen Thursday.

130
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,551
You're gonna tell me all about your
science stuff and I'm gonna complain

131
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,239
about my movie,
and we're gonna support each other

132
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,431
-because that's what friends do.
-Okay.

133
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,471
lfl had to pick now,
I'd probably go with dark matter--

134
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:52,271
Shut up.

135
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,109
(GROANS)

136
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:08,196
-What's wrong?
-I don't understand my food.

...in ataco.

lt's fusion.

140
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,434
Well, my mother would
lock her car doors

141
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,676
if she had to drive through
this hodgepodge of ethnicity.

142
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:30,956
Think I've been complaining
too much about the movie?

143
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,118
-Not at all.
-Thank you.

144
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,834
But to be fair, when you talk,
most of what you say sounds like,

145
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,191
"Wah, wah, wah, clothes.
Wah, wah, wah."

146
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:45,391
Hey, I don't understand
why you're not upset with Amy.

147
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,194
lam. So much so that
I'm gonna bring her here

148
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:49,957
for dinner on our next date night.

(FAST PACED MUSIC
BLARES FROM TELEVISION)

150
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,637
Okay.

151
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:04,354
So, in the last 20 minutes,

152
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,915
we've seen a crazy woman
kissing a fetus in ajar.

153
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,275
We've seen a guy cut in half
and sewn to a fish.

154
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,712
And the brutal dismemberment
of a rotisserie chicken by my mother.

155
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:22,991
On the bright side,
she didn't even notice the pill.

156
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,830
Why does Emily like this stuff?

157
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,110
Do you think there's something
psychologically wrong with her?

158
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,515
-What difference does it make?
-What do you mean?

159
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,118
Oh, come on, she could
have a freezer full

160
00:08:34,319 --> 00:08:36,708
of ex-boyfriend's body parts
and you'd still go out with her.

161
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,753
I do like that the ex-boyfriend's
out of the picture.

| feel so bad
about lying to Sheldon.

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,519
How am I gonna make it up to him?

164
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:50,516
I'd tell you what I do with Howard,

165
00:08:50,719 --> 00:08:52,630
but I don't think dressing up
like a Catholic schoolgirl

166
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,671
is gonna work with Sheldon.

167
00:08:58,479 --> 00:09:00,435
He'd probably give you homework.
