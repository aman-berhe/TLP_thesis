Gentlemen, Star Wars Day
is rapidly approaching.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,198
We should finalize our plans.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,277
What? That's a real thing?

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,270
What is it, Star Wars Christmas?

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,710
No. Don't be ridiculous.

6
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:17,671
That's Wunkie Life Day.

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,070
So when is it?

8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,635
Well, it's not May the fifth,

9
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:25,148
and it's not May the third...

10
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,714
lt's May the fourth.

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,468
Get it?

12
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,073
May the "fourth" be with you?

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,076
"May the force be with you."
Get it?

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,555
Oh, no, this face
wasn't because I didn't get it.

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,872
Hey, you got a second?

18
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,230
Yes. Actually, I'm glad you're here.

19
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,193
I'm working on
the Star Wars Day schedule.

20
00:01:20,399 --> 00:01:23,789
Now, l have a window built in
after Phantom Menace,

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,797
for complaining, but...

22
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,434
...l'm worried an hour
won't be enough time.

23
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,629
Sheldon, I've got some bad news.

24
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,435
What is it?

25
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,274
ljust read online that
Arthur Jeffries passed away.

26
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,198
Professor Proton is dead?

27
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:48,991
Sorry, buddy.

28
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,836
What are you doing?

29
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,233
Comforting you?

30
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,270
Your heart might be
in the right place,

31
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,596
but your head, chest
and arms certainly aren't.

32
00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:12,596
Anyway, the funeral's on Sunday.

33
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,030
But, that's Star Wars Day.

34
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,151
Yeah...

35
00:02:17,359 --> 00:02:19,475
Of all the things about this
that are sad,

36
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,477
that might not be number one.

37
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,796
You OK?
I know he meant a lot to you.

38
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,790
I'm fine.

39
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,674
OK.

40
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,677
Yet he cried when they changed
the Raisin Bran box.

41
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,473
This is something
interesting, boys and girls.

42
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,275
After an owl eats,
he spits up part of his meal,

43
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:47,710
that he can't digest,
in the form of a pellet.

old friend?

Yes. Look at him, Amy.

49
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,239
It's such a shame.

50
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:14,033
Struck down
in the prime of my life.

51
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:18,396
Do you want me to go to
the funeral with you?

52
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,751
-l'm not going to the funeral.
-Why not?

53
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,871
All those people
blowing their noses.

54
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,714
You can't tell the sick
from the sad.

55
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:31,548
I'll be at home celebrating
Star Wars Day, as planned.

56
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,955
Are you sure you don't
want to go say good-bye?

57
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,188
Amy, mourning the inevitable
is a complete waste of time.

58
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,630
And watching a bunch
of goofy space movies

59
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,035
you've seen hundreds
of times isn't?

60
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,552
If we were in
a physical relationship,

61
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,033
you just lost sex tonight.

62
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:52,634
Hey, guys.

63
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,956
Hey, Penny.
Happy Star Wars Day.

64
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:58,468
OK.

65
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,708
Can I make you breakfast?

66
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,912
Admiral Ackbar's Snack Bar
is open for business.

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,956
No, thanks. Leonard and l
are just going to the funeral.

68
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,957
You sure? Not even coffee?

69
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,752
We have R2-Decaf.

70
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,515
Maybe a nice Cafe Au Leia?

71
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,192
And if you're not
in the mood for coffee,

72
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,355
I can always make you
a Chai Tea-SPO.

73
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,272
| get it-- like C-SPO.

74
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:25,834
What happened to me?

75
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:29,916
-Hey, Sheldon, you want anything?
-No, thank you.

76
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,553
You're being so quiet.

77
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,876
Are you upset
or are you just rebooting?

78
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,593
I'm fine.

79
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,394
Sweetie, are you sure you don't want
to come with us to the funeral?

80
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:42,557
I appreciate the offer,
but Arthur is gone

81
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,351
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

82
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,710
When Darth Vader
struck down Obi-Wan,

83
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,717
did Luke cry like a baby
and go to his funeral?

84
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,352
No, he blew up the Death Star.

85
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,232
Why do I know this?!

86
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:56,429
Arthur Jeffries was a scientist.

87
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,314
I'm sure he didn't care about
silly superstitions like funerals.

88
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,635
You know, if he were here,

89
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,035
I think he'd say,
"Enjoy Star Wars Day."

90
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,437
He was 84.
He'd say, "Where's my pudding?"

91
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,236
Before you go, at least
let me pack you some

92
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,431
Attack of the Scones
for the road.

93
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,556
Oh, like Attack of the Clones.

94
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:18,590
We are leaving right now!

95
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:23,311
Arthur passing away
was harder on Sheldon

96
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,713
than he's ready to admit.

97
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,035
Really hoping this will cheer him up.

98
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,559
Me, too.

99
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,112
Although, it might've been
thoughtless of us

100
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:30,752
to bake a Death Star cake.

101
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:34,758
No, it combines two of
Sheldon's favorite things:

102
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,473
chocolate chips and the ability
to destroy a planet

103
00:05:37,679 --> 00:05:39,112
at the push of a button.

104
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:42,430
Well, anyway, it'll be
a nice surprise for the boys.

105
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,516
And Howie doesn't think
I take his interests seriously,

106
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,915
so hopefully this will keep
him fooled for a while.

107
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,753
OK, let's get the fondant
and start decorating.

108
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,188
This is pretty cool.

109
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,550

spherical cakes.

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,913
I wonder why that is.

112
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,991
l have a confession to make.

113
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:09,917
I've never been
to a funeral before.

114
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,030
Really?

115
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,800
| just never knew anyone that died.

116
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,319
I had a pet pig
when l was a kid.

117
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:17,510
I mean, when he died,
we didn't have a funeral,

118
00:06:17,719 --> 00:06:19,311
we had a barbecue.

119
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:24,671
Yeah, we won't be
eating Arthur tonight.

120
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,070
I didn't know him very well,
but I still really liked him.

121
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,158
It's weird that he's... just gone.

122
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,713
I know.

123
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,034
| feel like I want to cry.

124
00:06:38,239 --> 00:06:39,957
Oh, that's... that's fine.

125
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,388
Go ahead.

126
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,759
I can't do it with you staring at me.

127
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,188
Sorry.

128
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,353

And he inspired a lot of people.

135
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,749
Sure, he was
my childhood hero, but...

136
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:21,393
...the fact that I got
to work with him,

137
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,114
side by side, before he...

138
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,787

(GROANS)
Let's get this over with.

146
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,272
Since we all agree
Episode I isn't our favorite,

147
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,674
maybe we just skip it this time.

148
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,757
Yeah, Howard,
I think you of all people

149
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,552
should avoid espousing
the principle

150
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,159
that if something
is not our favorite,

151
00:07:58,359 --> 00:07:59,474
we should just get rid of it.

152
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:05,155
You know, I heard this way
of watching the movies

153
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,318
called the Machete Order,
where you watch Episodes IV and V,

154
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:10,077
then skip Episode I,

155
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,271
watch II and III
as a flashback,

156
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,799
and then finish with VI.

157
00:08:13,999 --> 00:08:15,876
OK, so you'd lose
most of Jar Jar,

158
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,593
all the trade route talk,
and the boring senate hearings,

159
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:21,154
which are like watching C-SPAN
with monsters.

160
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,790
Get rid of the trade route part?
Then how would Palpatine

161
00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:28,672
get Chancellor Valorum
kicked out of office?

162
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,517
How would he get
himself elected? How?

163
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,358
Can we get through one holiday

164
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,279
without you saying
something ridiculous?

165
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,714
It was just a suggestion.

166
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,876
Well, you know what else
was just a suggestion?

167
00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:41,673
"Why don't we change
the Raisin Bran box?"

168
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,319

who got hurt by that?

who eats breakfast!

I think he's taking this Professor
Proton thing pretty hard.

171
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,036
Should we try to console him?

172
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,155
Or... should we respect his privacy
in this moment of grief?

and watching the movie.

00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:15,994
we got to start with Episode IV.

178
00:09:16,199 --> 00:09:17,154
True.

179
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:22,429
-I do feel guilty about him.
-Me, too.

180
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,471
-Maybe we should see how he's doing.
-Yeah.

181
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,831
-But after the cantina scene.
-Obviously.

182
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:29,438
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

183
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,349
Look at Arthur,
cracking up at ajoke I told him.

184
00:09:41,199 --> 00:09:42,917
I'll never hear
that laugh again.

185
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,236
MAN: You never heard it that time.

186
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:51,512
Arthur!

187
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,039
I thought you were dead.

188
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,275
I am.

189
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,710
Oh, it's fantastic.

190
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,153
I mean, this is the longest
that I've gone

191
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,432
without running into a men's room

192
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,471
in... in years.

193
00:10:08,319 --> 00:10:09,911
Why are you here?

194
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,190
I don't know. I was...

195
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,109
I was hoping I was going
to haunt my ex-wife.

196
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,837
I know why.

197
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:25,319
You've come to me because...
you're my Obi-Wan.

198
00:10:25,439 --> 00:10:28,192
I'm... I'm not...
I'm not familiar with that.

199
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,197
Is... Is that an...

200
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:33,629
...an Internet?

201
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,789
Wow. You're dead,
so I'm going to let that slide.

202
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,396
Obi-Wan Kenobi is a character
from Star Wars.

203
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,558
After his physical demise,
he comes to Luke Skywalker

204
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:50,193
as his mentor in spirit form.

205
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,755
Well, that...
that clears that up.

206
00:10:56,199 --> 00:10:58,349
You must be here
to give me advice.

207
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,437
Well, this... this is weird.

208
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,794
Most-most of my robes open in...

209
00:11:09,999 --> 00:11:11,591
...in the back.

210
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:16,149
Those are your Jedi robes.

211
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,117
Wait. What...?

212
00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:22,389
What... what is this?

213
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,913
Be careful with that!

214
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,159
Whoa! (CHUCKLES)

215
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,397
Neato.

216
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:47,789
I'm... I'm gonna need a Band-Aid.

217
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,037
So... what did you think
of your first funeral?

218
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,674
Well, I don't want to be ajerk,
but it was kind of a bummer.

219
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,711
Yeah, well, when I die,
you can rent a bounce house.

220
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:05,632
You think about dying?

221
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,673
Well, I think more about
if I'd have any regrets.

222
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:09,948
What would you regret?

223
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,993
You know,
that I didn't travel more,

224
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,554
take more risks,
learn another language.

225
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,069
You know Klingon.

226
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,680
-That's true.
-No, I meant that as a regret.

227
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:27,674
ljust thought of one more.

228
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,199
What's that?

229
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:32,789
I regret not saying "yes"
when you asked me to marry you.

230
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,751
Well, it just wasn't the right time.

231
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,678
Yeah.

232
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,552
And this is also
not the right time.

233
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,272
Do not propose.

234
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,391
-What?
-I know that face.

235
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,113
That's your propose face.

236
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,118
I was not gonna propose.
It's already two to one.

237
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,230
What's two to one?

238
00:12:49,439 --> 00:12:50,667
I proposed twice,
you proposed once. Two to one.

239
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,359
Oh, my... It's not a contest.

240
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,788
I don't know what
you're upset about.

241
00:12:53,999 --> 00:12:55,990
-I'm the one who's losing.
-OK.

242
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,918
Fine. Would you feel
better if I propose

243
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,394
so you could turn
me down again?

244
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,749
Yeah, I think I would.

245
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,757
OK. Leonard,
will you marry me?

246
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,430
Hm...

247
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,753
No, don't you dare.

248
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,837
You reject me right
now and tie things up.

249
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,918
It's just such a big decision.

250
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,712
I don't want to have any regrets.

251
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,878
Did you ever watch Professor Proton
when you were a kid?

252
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:23,274
No. My dad controlled the TV,

253
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,072
so unless someone
was a Texas Ranger,

254
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,670
Jake or the Fatman,
we didn't see it.

255
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,950
I never watched him, either,
but he seems to be the reason

256
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:32,751
that Sheldon got interested
in science.

257
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,598
Not me. I got into science

258
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,233
'cause I was always
the smallest kid in school,

259
00:13:36,439 --> 00:13:38,157
so I thought if I
became a scientist,

260
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,953
I could invent a formula
that made me taller.

261
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,592
That's cute.

262
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,836
Yeah, I thought it was working
for a while,

263
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,075
but then I found out
my brother was just

264
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:48,110
lowering the pencil marks
on the door frame.

265
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,512
How about you?

266
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,917
Oh, I guess it must have been
back when I was in the Girl Sprouts.

267
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,874
Girl Sprouts?

268
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,992
My mom made it up as an
alternative to the Girl Scouts.

269
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,477
She didn't want me selling cookies
on some street corner "like a whore."

270
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,996
How did that get
you into science?

271
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,634
Oh, I went to the library
and took out a book on biology

272
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,670
to see what whores did.

273
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,238
On the one hand,
if I say yes...

274
00:14:22,439 --> 00:14:24,157
This isn't funny anymore.

275
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,759
Just say no
so we're done with this.

276
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,154
Will you marry me or not?

277
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,074
Ooh, interesting. Did you just
propose to me again?

278
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:32,714
No.

279
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:35,036
Really? Because ljust heard,
"Will you marry me?"

280
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,073
That's two proposals,
one day.

281
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,235
Sounds like someone wants
to spend the rest of her life

282
00:14:40,439 --> 00:14:43,078
telling people how to spell
the name Hofstadter.

283
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,107
You know what? Fine.
Do whatever you want.

284
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:48,749
Hey.

285
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:51,274
Penny, don't get upset.

286
00:14:51,439 --> 00:14:53,031
Here.

287
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,829
I love you, but, no,
I will not marry you.

288
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,393
Thank you.

289
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,195
Now, about that second proposal.
On the one hand...

290
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,912
Where... where... where are we?

291
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,995
This is the swampland
of Dagobah.

292
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,987
It's where Luke was trained
in the ways of the Jedi.

293
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,159
Too bad.
I thought it was Florida.

294
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,310
When Obi-Wan came to Luke
on this very spot,

295
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:39,079
he gave him all sorts
of helpful advice.

296
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,951
So, um...

297
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,196
...what do you got for me?

298
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:46,515
Um...

299
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:49,950
Always...

300
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,554
...get... get a prenup.

301
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:57,870
That's it?

302
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:00,991
I thought there'd be more
of a reason why you're here.

303
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,476
Well, why do you think I'm here?

304
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,910
I suppose it has something to do
with your recent passing.

305
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,669
Is this the... the first time
you've lost, you know,

306
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:13,153
someone close to you?

307
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,555
Oh, no. No.

308
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,638
I've already had to say good-bye
to 11 Dr. Whos.

309
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:26,354
Yeah, I've... I've outlived
a few of my doctors, too.

310
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,277
Of course, my grandfather
died when I was five.

311
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,789
My father died when I was 14.

312
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,719
I'm... I'm sorry about that.

313
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,638
And now you're gone, too.

314
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,038
It's like all the men I've
looked up to have gone away.

315
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,229
Well, you know, it's...
it's OK to...

316
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:48,832
...to be sad about them.

317
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,556
Just... just make sure,
you know, you appreciate...

318
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,035
...those who...
who are still there for you.

319
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:59,670
But I do appreciate them.

320
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:02,438
Well, then...

321
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:06,349
...what am I doing in a swamp...

322
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,719
...dressed like Friar Tuck?

323
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,630
Appreciate them, Sheldon.

324
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:22,953
(KNOCKING)

325
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,234
Hey, buddy.

326
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,237
Heard you're having a rough day.
You all right?

327
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,793
I'm OK.

328
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,750
How was the funeral?

329
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,875
It was nice, you know.

330
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,116
A lot of people showed up,

331
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:40,992
told some great stories about him.

332
00:17:41,199 --> 00:17:44,475
Did you know that Arthur's son
is a high school sci--?

333
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:01,356
Hey, the guys are about
to start Jedi.

334
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:03,868
-You want to go watch?
-I do.

335
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,876
After I make them go back and
watch one through five first.

336
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,830
-Sheldon, that'll take us all night.
-That's true.

337
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,111
It's a good thing I had a nap.

338
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,997
Boy, some of the physical comedy
with Jar Jar

339
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,236
is a little tough to watch.

340
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:33,071
At least they toned him down
in the second one.

341
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,310
Yeah, he is pretty stupid.

342
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,513
Hey, we can say it. You can't.

343
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:45,147
-Hey, guys.
-Happy Star Wars Day!

344
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:46,871
(ALL EXCLAIMING, LAUGHING)

345
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,472
A Death Star cake!

346
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:50,112
Yeah, we were hoping
it might cheer you up.

347
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,038
And even though it meant
we had to miss the movies,

348
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,468
we could still be
part of the fun.

349
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,510
Well, you didn't miss anything.
We just started over.

350
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,312
Son of a bitch.

351
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,829
J“ (ORCHES TRAL SCORE)

352
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:14,387
You're back.

353
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,431
Yeah, apparently...

354
00:19:16,639 --> 00:19:19,073
...l'm here whenever...
whenever you need me.

355
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:20,917
That's nice.

356
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:23,751
Maybe for you.

357
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,350
Why do I need you now?

358
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,755
Well, as near as I could tell,

359
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,872
you fell asleep watching Star Wars,

360
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,470
and now you're dreaming
you're watching Star Wars.

361
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,158
So?

362
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,070
I mean, don't you see
a problem there?

363
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:46,637
I mean, how you're spending
your limited time on earth?

364
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,719
Not at all.

365
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,189
OK, good luck to you.

366
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,957
