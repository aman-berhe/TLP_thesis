1
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:05,591
Almost there.
You're doing great.

2
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:08,871
Thanks for lifting my spirits.
Next time, try lifting the box.

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,789
Please hurry.

4
00:00:11,999 --> 00:00:13,557
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
I don't need a treadmill!

5
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:16,228
The doctor says you need
to get exercise!

6
00:00:16,439 --> 00:00:18,555
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
I get plenty of aren‘ise!

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,638
(SHOUTING) Crushing my will
to live isn't exercise!

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,950
If she isn't gonna use it,
then why are we doing this?

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,071
She'll use it.
All I need is to rig it

10
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,032
with afishing pole
and a HoneyBaked harn.

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,229
All right.

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:32,667
Now what?

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,348
-We set it up in Howie's old room.
-Do you know how to set it up?

14
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,757
Please, I'm an MIT-trained engineer.
lthink I can handle...

15
00:00:38,959 --> 00:00:40,312
Ma, look out!

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,353
-(THUD)
-(YELL|NG)

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,918
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
I told you this thing would kill me!

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,633
J“ (THEME SONG PLAYING) J“

19
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,639
So she's gonna be laid up
for at least six weeks.

20
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,034
Poor Mrs. Wolowitz.

21
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,117
Should we do something for her?

22
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,788
I know. Let's go see
the new Spider-Man movie.

23
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,548
Sheldon, we're talking about
your friend's mother. She got hurt.

24
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,719
I thought that subject had run
its course, so I changed it.

25
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,434
It's called reading the room, Amy.

26
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,118
-Hi.
-Hey, how were things on the set?

27
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,799
Pretty good, actually.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,638
So the movie's
not as bad as you thought?

29
00:01:38,839 --> 00:01:41,478
Oh, no, it is, but I decided,
instead of complaining about it,

30
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,398
I'm just gonna go in
every day and give it my all.

31
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,555
-Good for you.
-Thanks.

32
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,716
There's no reason
why I shouldn't be the best

33
00:01:46,919 --> 00:01:49,069
bisexual go-go dancer
slowly transforming

34
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,874
into a killer gorilla
anyone's ever seen.

35
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:56,038
I don't know. The bisexual gorilla
go-go dancer in Schindler's List

36
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,150
is tough to beat.

37
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,554
Ah, very good.

38
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,479
Because a gorilla go-go dancer
of any sexual preference

39
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,796
would be out of place in afilm
about the Holocaust.

40
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,232
It only gets funnier
when you explain it, Sheldon.

41
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:10,958
I know.

42
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:17,953
(SIGHS)
Okay, she's all settled in the guest room.

43
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,674
Maybe we should get one of those
machines to help her up the stairs.

44
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,312
You mean a forklift?

45
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,435
-Howie...
-l'm sorry.

46
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:27,277
ljust can't deal
with this right now.

47
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,516
Taking care of your own mother?
How can you say that?

48
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,188
Bernie, she's gonna be off her feet
for six to eight weeks.

49
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,870
Are you prepared to feed her,
wash her and take her to the toilet?

50
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,398
-I would do it for my mother.
-Yeah, of course you would.

51
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,157
You're a loving person.

52
00:02:41,359 --> 00:02:44,032
I'm what my people would call a putz.

53
00:02:46,359 --> 00:02:49,396
Look, I'm not crazy about the idea,
but what other choice do we have?

54
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,558
We get a nurse. Preferably someone
from a third world country

55
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,558
who's used to suffering
and unpleasant smells.

56
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,712
You'd hire a total stranger
to take care

57
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,717
of the woman who raised you?
That's so cruel.

58
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,910
Not if we pay them well

59
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,793
and let them listen
to the music of their homeland.

60
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,913
MRS. WOLOWITZ: [need to tinkle!

61
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,236
Sounds like the job
for a loving person.

62
00:03:15,359 --> 00:03:17,919
Would you liike me to play Polish music
while you carry her to the toilet?

63
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,712
You are a putz.

64
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,152
As advertised.

65
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:29,787
Thanks for coming with me.

66
00:03:29,999 --> 00:03:32,467
Thanks for inviting me
after everyone else said no.

67
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,159
Aren't you gonna get 3-D glasses?

68
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:37,838
I brought my own.

69
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,794
No sense in risking
bridge-of-nose herpes.

70
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,035
Is that a real thing?

71
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,630
Well, until they invent
nose condoms, I'm not finding out.

72
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,511
Emily! Hey!

73
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:54,471
Oh, hey, Raj.

74
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,796
This is my friend, Sheldon.
Sheldon, this is Emily.

75
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,750
Oh, yes, you're the dermatologist.

76
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,712
I went for a walk yesterday
without sunscreen.

77
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,315
Do you see anything on my forehead

78
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,875
that I should be concerned about?

79
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,079
Um, you know what? I better go.
My movie's about to start.

80
00:04:14,279 --> 00:04:16,315
-Are you here alone?
-No, not really.

81
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,875
-What do you mean, "not really"?
-Hey, should we get our seats?

82
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,436
Yeah. It was nice seeing you.
I'll call you later.

83
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,550
Yeah, okay.

84
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,753
That was awkward, right?

85
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,833
Is it because she's dating you
but was out with that other fellow?

86
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:36,154
-Yes.
-Good.

87
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,838
I thought she saw
something on my forehead.

88
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,033
And... action.

89
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,993
-Please don't shut me out.
-PENNY: Go away.

90
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,956
Just go away.

91
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,229
I swear, lwill find
a way to turn you back.

92
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,513
What gave you the right to mix my DNA
with that of a killer gorilla?

93
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,912
l was trying to save your life.

94
00:05:00,119 --> 00:05:02,917
Life? What life?
Look at me! I'm a monster!

95
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:06,873
And now! have blood on my hands,
or paws. I don't know.

96
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,678
You can't give up.
I love you.

97
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:16,634
I love you too.

98
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,559
But I'm afraid I love killing more.

99
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,954
Like, one day,
I might actually try and kill you!

100
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:24,075
(MANIC SCREAMING)

101
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,910
And... cut.
All right.

102
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,999
All right,
let's set up for the next scene.

103
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,235
Actually, know what?
Can we do one more?

104
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,469
I think I could do it better.

105
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,511
Let's just move on.
No one cares.

106
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,909
Well, I care.
I mean, look, if we're gonna do this,

107
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,799
why not try and make it
something we're actually proud of?

108
00:05:46,799 --> 00:05:50,155
Look, sweetie, this movie is garbage,
but you should be happy about that,

109
00:05:50,359 --> 00:05:52,793
'cause if it was a good movie,
you wouldn't be in it.

110
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,551
Whoa, whoa, hang on.
There's no need to insult her.

111
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,431
-And who are you?
-l'm her boyfriend.

112
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,712
-lsn't she too hot for you?
-A little, yeah.

113
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,638
Well, boyfriend, get off my set.

114
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,193
You can't do that.
He's with me.

115
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,231
You know what? You can get off
my set, too. You're fired.

116
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,317
What? You can't fire me.
I'm the star.

117
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:12,829
I'm the girl that goes bananas.
It says so on the poster.

118
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,270
Yeah, but we just shot the last scene
where we see your face.

119
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,390
So from now own, the star
of the movie is whoever wears this.

120
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,310
Hey, if you're gonna fire her,
then you have to fire me too.

121
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,876
Wow, that fell apart really fast.

122
00:06:34,119 --> 00:06:35,393
Thanks for skipping the movie.

123
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,477
I couldn't sit in that theater
for two hours

124
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:39,351
wondering about Emily and that guy.

125
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,312
Oh, quite all right.

126
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:43,475
After my forehead melanoma scare,

127
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,035
I've learned not to sweat
the small stuff.

128
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,354
Well, sorry, I don't have all
the ingredients to make chai tea.

129
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,710
-You don't have to make me anything.
-No, I do.

130
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,875
You're upset about Emily
and you're lndian.

131
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,751
I need to make you chai tea.

132
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,599
Now, l have all the ingredients
except cardamom seeds.

133
00:07:03,559 --> 00:07:05,629
Do you happen to have any on you?

134
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:08,996
Sorry, I left them in my turban.

135
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,991
Oh, I'll make English breakfast tea.

136
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,350
They destroyed your culture.
That's close enough.

137
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,433
You know, I'm curious,

138
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,199
why are you so upset
about seeing Emily with another man?

139
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,198
Wouldn't you be upset if you saw
Amy out with someone else?

140
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,551
Can't happen. We have an ironclad
relationship agreement

141
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,355
which precludes her from physical
contact with anyone other than me.

142
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:38,469
But you don't have sex
with her either.

143
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,955
(SCOFFS)
Slick, huh?

144
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,476
To be truthful,
Emily and I haven't dated that long,

145
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:46,431
and we never agreed
to be exclusive to each other.

146
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,833
Have you had intercourse?

147
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,950
No.

148
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,549
Well, stick to your guns.
There will be a lot of pressure.

149
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,149
MRS. WOLOWITZ: I'm hungry again!

150
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,153
It's like the world's
fattest cuckoo clock.

151
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,395
You know, you're always talking
about having a baby someday.

152
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,592
-This is exactly what it'll be like.
-No, it's not.

153
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:19,077
Come on. The constant fussing,
eating, pooping, burping, drooling.

154
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,238
We're even waiting for the day
when she can finally walk on her own.

155
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,510
Maybe you're right.

156
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,597
Anything she finds on the floor
goes right in her mouth.

157
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,676
I'm just telling you now,
if we do have kids,

158
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:37,074
don't expect me to do all the work.

159
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,077
Hey, I'm a very paternal person.

160
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:42,793
I'd be excellent
at taking care of a baby.

161
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,312
MRS. WOLOWITZ: I'm still hungry!

162
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,838
(SHOUTING) I'm coming, you big baby!

163
00:08:52,439 --> 00:08:54,430
You know, the only thing
worse than doing a movie

164
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:56,357
where they glue monkey hair
to your ass

165
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,189
is getting fired from a movie where
they glue monkey hair to your ass.

166
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,319
Forget it, man, it's crap.
You just move on to the next thing.

167
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,955
Yeah, well, it's easy for you to say.
You used to be famous.

168
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,875
Hey. ljust lost ajob for you.

169
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:14,035
You're right,
I'm sorry, you're famous.

170
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,632
Penny, it's not about being famous.
It's about the art.

171
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,592
It's about the passion
we have for our craft.

172
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,916
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

173
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,595
l have an audition
for Sharknado 2!

174
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,710
lfl book this, I am totally gonna
pay you back for this beer.

175
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,350
God, what am I doing with my life?

176
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,039
You having second
thoughts about acting?

177
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,878
You were on set,
you saw what it was like.

178
00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:40,115
Yeah, but it's not always that bad.

179
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,230
Oh, really?

180
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:44,391
What about when you did Anne Frank
at that cute little theater?

181
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:46,630
It was over a bowling alley.

182
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,195
Yeah, but...

183
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:51,557
...there was ample parking.

184
00:09:53,199 --> 00:09:54,234
Are you done?

185
00:09:54,439 --> 00:09:56,191
And you were so good
in the TV commercial.

186
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,072
It was for hemorrhoid cream.

187
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,954
And I got itchy and swollen
just watching you.

188
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,232
Leonard, you are really
not cheering me up.

189
00:10:08,439 --> 00:10:10,634
Come on. How can you be sad
when you're going home

190
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:13,831
with all five-foot-six of this?

191
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:16,630
You think you're five-foot-six,
that's funny.

192
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,033
I don't understand it.

193
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,310
I'm a nice guy, I have a great job,

194
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:27,511
l'm well-educated,
come from a good family...

195
00:10:27,719 --> 00:10:29,277
Why don't women want to be with me?

196
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,471
An interesting question.

197
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:36,074
Well... good night.

198
00:10:37,319 --> 00:10:41,107
What? Don't send me home.
I can't be alone right now.

199
00:10:41,319 --> 00:10:44,038
That's your problem.
You can't be alone.

200
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,434
What do you mean?

201
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,677
How many women
have you had dates with?

202
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,190
Eleven.

203
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,233
How many of those women did you think
would become your perfect companion?

204
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,592
Eleven.

205
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,360
Wait. Do I count the ZOO-pound
Sailor Moon girl

206
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,028
that Howard and I had
a threesome with at Comic-Con?

207
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,514
Sure.

208
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,638
I'll stick with11.
She liked Howard better.

209
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,672
Well, now do you see the problem?

210
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,033
Maybe. I...
I don't know.

211
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,754
lt's late, I... I should...
I should go.

212
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,231
Look, I do get what you're saying.

213
00:11:31,439 --> 00:11:34,192
Instead of desperately clinging
to any woman who will go out with me,

214
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,436
I need to work
on my fear of being alone.

215
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:40,074
l was trying to suggest
chemical castration, but...

216
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,077
...it's my bedtime, so whatever
gets you out the door. Good night.

217
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,909
Howie, I'm back!

219
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,108
ljust got her to sleep.

220
00:11:54,319 --> 00:11:55,354
Sorry.

221
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,949
What took you so long?
The grocery store's a few blocks away.

222
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:00,275
They only had regular yogurt.
I had to go to a different store

223
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,835
to get the extra-fat kind
your mom likes.

224
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,877
Then why do | smell coffee
on your breath?

225
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,388
So what? After two days
of taking care of her,

226
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,397
excuse me for stopping
to get a mocha.

227
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:14,387
(HIGH-PITCHED) A mocha?
Well, it must be nice to be queen.

228
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:17,674
Queen?
I've been killing myself here!

229
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,632
Well, whose fault is that? I wanted
to get a nurse, but you were all,

230
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,433
(IMITATING BERNADETTE)
"l'm nice. I want to take care of people."

231
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,877
I'm glad I got that mocha.
And you know what else I'm glad about?

232
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,754
(SHOUTING) I bought you a brownie
and I ate it in the car!

233
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,839
MRS. WOLOWITZ: Howard!

234
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,429
Thanks a lot.
Now l have to go rub her belly again.

236
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:49,875
-Hey.
-Thanks for letting me come over.

237
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,309
Of course.
Please, come in.

238
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:57,869
| just wanted to say how sorry
lam about tonight, and...

239
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,991
...I want to make sure that we're okay.

240
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:03,228
Look, you and I haven't made
any commitments to each other.

241
00:13:03,439 --> 00:13:06,158
I know.
ljust felt like I needed to explain.

242
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,793
The guy I was
with did my last tattoo,

243
00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:09,751
and he's been
asking me out for months.

244
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:12,189
I finally said yes
just to get it over with.

245
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,391
-lt's okay.
-Really?

246
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:16,988
Well, I mean, yeah,
it freaked me out a little,

247
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:19,429
but that's my issue, not yours.

248
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,799
Wow.

249
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,673
If I saw you out with another woman,
I'd be pretty upset.

250
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:26,278
Thank you.

251
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,752
Not just for being upset,
but for believing that could happen.

252
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,589
Just so you know,
I'm not seeing anyone else.

253
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:39,673
Well, me neither.

254
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,878
-Okay.
-Okay.

255
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,675
Please.

256
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:47,474
-So, you... You have tattoos?
-Yeah.

257
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,159
I don't.

258
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,310
l have a hole in my belly button that
may or may not have been a piercing.

259
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,193
-That's cool.
-lt's a piercing.

260
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,791
So... how many tattoos?

261
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,274
One on my shoulder,
one not on my shoulder

262
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,392
and one really not on my shoulder.

263
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:13,191
lt's, uh... been a long time
since I've seen a girl's...

264
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,596
...really not her shoulder.

265
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,596
Well...

266
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,997
...how about you show me
your piercing

267
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,917
and | show you my tattoos?

268
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,516
But before I take my shirt off,
ljust need, like,

269
00:14:31,599 --> 00:14:33,237
ten minutes to do some crunches.

270
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,671
Oh, my God.

271
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:43,915
What a day.

272
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,792
Can I get you anything?

273
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,115
No.

274
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,509
I need to start
making some smart decisions.

275
00:14:50,719 --> 00:14:51,868
With your career?

276
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,353
With my life.

277
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,309
Like what?

278
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,468
I don't know.

279
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:00,107
We could get married.

280
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:02,910
-Come on, be serious.
-I am.

281
00:15:03,999 --> 00:15:07,196
Why?
Because I'm a "smart decision"?

282
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,310
Well, yeah.

283
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,994
So, I'm like a bran muffin.

284
00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:15,310
What, no, that's not what I'm saying.

285
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,271
No, it's exactly what you're saying.
I'm the boring thing

286
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,357
you're choosing
because I'm good for you.

287
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,630
What does it matter?
The point is, I'm choosing you.

288
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,148
Well, it matters a lot.
I don't want to be a bran muffin.

289
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:27,957
I want to be a...
Cinnabon, you know?

290
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,190
A strawberry Pop-Tart.

291
00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:35,715
Something you're excited about even
though it could give you diabetes.

292
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,157
Sweetie, you can be
any pastry you want.

293
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,113
No, no. No, it's too late.
I'm your bran muffin.

294
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:44,958
Probably fat-free
and good for your colon.

295
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,191
You know what? Forget it.
I never should've brought it up.

296
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,997
You know I want to marry you,
but you're only doing this

297
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:54,190
because you got fired
and you're feeling sorry for yourself.

298
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,151
Okay, it may look that way,
but getting fired

299
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,430
from that movie was the best thing
that could have happened to me, okay.

300
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,391
I finally realize
I don't need to be famous

301
00:16:00,599 --> 00:16:02,237
or have some big career to be happy.

302
00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:05,875
-Then what do you need?
-You, you stupid Pop-Tart!

303
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:11,991
Oh.

304
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,354
Then I guess I'm in.

305
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,352
Really?
You guess you're in?

306
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,749
Not like, "I guess I'm in."
Like "I guess I'm in!"

307
00:16:26,479 --> 00:16:28,276
Okay. Cool.

308
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,031
So is that it?
Are we engaged?

309
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,595
Yeah, I think so.

310
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,434
All right.

311
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,510
What's wrong?

312
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:49,427
I'm not sure.
Just... feels a little anticlimactic.

313
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,837
Yeah, it kind of does, huh?

314
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,196
Oh, I know.

315
00:16:57,879 --> 00:16:59,278
This might help.

316
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,708
Where did you get a ring?

317
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,275
I've... had it for a couple years,
not important.

318
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:17,353
Penny... will you marry me?

319
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,592
Oh, my God, yes.

320
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,231
This would have been
so much more romantic

321
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,192
if you didn't have
monkey hair on your finger.

322
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:39,238
How you feeling?

323
00:17:39,439 --> 00:17:43,068
Last night was a little rough,
but I think we're gonna get through this.

324
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:44,348
I'm proud of us.

325
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,197
Me, too.

326
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,277
MRS. WOLOWITZ: Where's my pancakes?

327
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,040
