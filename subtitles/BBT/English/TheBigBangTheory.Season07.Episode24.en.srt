00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,269
How's your mom holding up?

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,233
She's doing okay,
but we just lost another nurse.

3
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:10,428
How many is that new?

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,950
Two, and I know what you're
thinking: she's eating them.

5
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:18,315
She's just so impossible,
they keep quitting.

6
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:19,872
So, who's watching her new?

7
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:23,276
A bowl full of MEM's
with a few Ambien tossed in.

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,870
What up, guys?

9
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:25,989
-He||o.
-Hey.

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,390
Okay, well, now that everyone's here,

11
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,749
Penny and l have some big news.

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,510
We're engaged!

13
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,517
Oh, my God! Congratulations!

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,989
And I thought me having sex with
Emily was gonna be the big news.

15
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:43,558
(ALL CHEERING)

16
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:47,115
-Oh, my God!
-Hey! Hey!

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,352
What the hell!

18
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,276
You guys propose all the time.
This never happens.

19
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:56,558
You're right!

21
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,071
Boy, I'm so hungrytoday.

22
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:27,558
I wonder why?

23
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,998
Because you had sex the other night?

24
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,559
You know what?

25
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,397
That may be it.

26
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:38,916
By the way,
it isn't like riding a bike.

27
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,837
Like, I fell off a few times.

28
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:45,789
-Hey, buddy.
-Hello.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,069
You okay?

30
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,990
ljust got called
into President Siebert's office.

31
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,957
The university
won't let me switch my field

32
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,548
of study to inflationary
cosmology.

33
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,227
They're forcing me
to continue with string theory.

34
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,237
-Why?
-He said it's why they hired me,

35
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:04,350
it's what my grant
was designated for,

36
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,757
and that everybody has to
do things they don't want to do.

37
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,757
He then gave an example
of something he had to do,

38
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,712
even though he didn't want to,
which was look at my stupid face.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,197
That's a rude thing to say out loud.

40
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:24,035
It's an outrage. Honestly, I'm
tempted to leave the university.

41
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,116
You know, if you're
really serious about that,

42
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,514
I hear there are some
exciting opportunities

43
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,789
in home care for the old and fat.

44
00:02:32,359 --> 00:02:34,919
Whatever you do,
just don't make any rash decisions.

45
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,634
I don't know. I am really aggravated.

46
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:41,108
When I'm feeling low,
I have sex with a girl.

47
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,712
But that's just me.

48
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,717
-Oh, come on, give her a chance.
-No.

49
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,035
No, life, it is too short.

50
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,512
I know you've only been here
a day and a half,

51
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,471
but you're like part of the family!

52
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,479
I don't think the service
is gonna send any more people.

53
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:07,389
Yeah, maybe it's time we just
release Ma back into the sea.

54
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,829
That's not helpful.

55
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,793
Well, then, we may need
to get used to the idea

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,992
that we're gonna be living here
the next few months.

57
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,272
But we have jobs.
We can't babysit her 24 hours a day.

58
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,074
Well, what if we use
our vacation time?

59
00:03:23,279 --> 00:03:26,749
I wanted to go to Hawaii, not Hell.

60
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,712
I don't know what else we can do.

61
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,912
Howie, I love you, and as your wife,
your mother is every bit

62
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,032
as much my problem
as she is yours, so...

63
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,311
...I want a divorce.

64
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,075
Hello, Leonard.

65
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:46,553
Hi, Mom.

66
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,432
l have some exciting news.

67
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:51,153
I'm listening.

68
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:54,069
Before I tell you,
will you promise to try

69
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:57,635
and be happy for me and keep
any concerns you have to yourself?

70
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,635
No.

71
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,037
Let me save you all
of your hemming and hawing.

72
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,038
Sheldon already told me
that you and Penny are engaged.

73
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:12,187
I hate that you talk to him
more than you talk to me.

74
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,595
Would you like for you
and me to talk more?

75
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,389
You know what? It's probably fine.

76
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:22,636
In any event,
while I've had my misgivings

77
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,830
about... Penny...

78
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,310
...Sheldon spoke very fondly of her,

79
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,238
and if she is good enough for him,

80
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,351
then she's good enough for me.

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,356
I'm your son. What about the fact
that she's good enough for me?

82
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,833
Sure.

83
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,315
Thanks, Mom.

84
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:46,237
Leonard, would it make
you feel better

85
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,319
to hear that your mother
approved of your life choices?

86
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,194
Yes, it would.

87
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:56,550
Yeah, well, you should work on that.

88
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,599
No, Mom, it's the same guy I've gone
out with for the past two years.

89
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:06,710
Yeah, the scientist.

90
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:11,072
Well, it's complicated. I mean, he
works with lasers and atomic magnets.

91
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,631
No, I did not see it coming.

92
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:19,797
No, we did not set a date.
No, I'm not pregnant.

93
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:23,515
Yeah, this is a first for our family.

94
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,947
All right, tell Dad I love him.
I gotta go. All right, bye.

95
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,277
-Atomic magnets?
-Shut up.

-You want some wine?
-Thanks.

100
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,907
Little warning before you jump
into this marriage business:

101
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,190
you're notjust marrying him,
you're marrying his family.

102
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,436
I think Leonard's mom's okay with me.

103
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,630
It doesn't matter if she's okay
with you. The question is:

104
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,750
can she go
to the bathroom by herself?

105
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,632
Hit me again.

106
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,355
So, what are the living
arrangements gonna be?

107
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:03,709
Well, haven't really talked
about it yet, but I figure,

108
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,114
at some point, I'll move in
with him, or he'll move in with me.

109
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,594
Well, with you not working,
that makes financial sense.

110
00:06:08,799 --> 00:06:12,348
You're not working! How would you
like ajob in home health care?

111

-No.

-Okay, then, yeah.

What you working on?

117

I'm writing an appeal
to the Faculty Senate,

118
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:38,271
so that I can move
on from string theory.

119
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,629
How's it going?

120
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,995
You tell me.

"Dear esteemed colleagues,

123
00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:48,078
As you may know, I have requested
to change my field of study.

124
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:52,113
My decision to do so is, I believe,
in the best interest of science.

At your convenience,
I'd be happy to explain it to you

in words you'll understand."

It's nice that
you called them esteemed.

You're right. I'll take that out.

So, listen, there was something
I was hoping to float past you.

Now that Penny and l are engaged,

131
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:13,309
I thought we might want to talk
about our living arrangements.

132
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,355
Of course.

133
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:18,198
She's spent many nights here,
and you're worried

134
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:22,187
about preserving the myth
of her virginity before the wedding.

-l'm not.
-Good,

136
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,715
because not only
has that ship sailed,

137
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,592
if it hit an iceberg,
countless men would perish.

138
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,955
Actually, this is about
where she and l are going to live.

139
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,512
What do you mean?

140
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,393
Well, well, we might
want to live together.

141
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,592
Oh, yeah, well, I've already
given this some thought,

142
00:07:42,799 --> 00:07:47,031
and I'm willing
to let Penny live with us

143
00:07:47,239 --> 00:07:49,514
one day a week for a trial period.

144
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,159
Now, obviously,
not when she's made cranky

145
00:07:54,359 --> 00:07:56,998
by the shedding
of her uterine lining.

146
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,955
That's very sweet.

147
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:05,912
But we were thinking more of us
maybe living together with...

148
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,790
...not you.

149
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:12,437
I don't understand.

150
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,673
How could we all live together
if I'm not there?

151
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,595
Look, I know this is...
this is change,

-and that sounds scary--
-Where are you going to go?

153
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:24,997
I don't know.

154
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,077
We just started to think about this.

155
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:28,428
Maybe I'll move in with Penny,

156
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,312
or maybe she and I'll take this
place, you can move across the hall.

157
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:33,396
Move across the hall?

158
00:08:34,319 --> 00:08:36,708

159
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,999
No, I did not.

160
00:08:41,199 --> 00:08:43,554
Did you get hit on the head
with a coconut?

161
00:08:44,719 --> 00:08:46,596
-No.
-Well, then, I'm all out of guesses.

162
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,031
What? Me move across the hall-- Why
would you even suggest such a thing?

163
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:53,675
Because I love Penny, and want
to give her the life she deserves.

165
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,638

bride's happiness above mine.

00:09:01,319 --> 00:09:03,230
Well, yeah.

167
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,115
Wow.

168
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,071
How dare the university force me
to go back to string theory!

169
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,837
Theyjust don't appreciate you.

170
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,349
Yeah, and on top of that,
Leonard has the audacity

171
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,630
to suggest that now
that he and Penny are engaged,

172
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,716
he may not want
to live with me anymore.

173
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,558
Here, I made you
some Strawberry Ouik.

174
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,397
l have real problems here, Amy.

175
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:30,159
I can't be mollified with
a beverage designed for children.

176
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,679
Mm. Yummy.

177
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,193
You know,
this might work out for the best.

178
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,471
You're always complaining about
what a terrible roommate Leonard is.

179
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,113
Like how he turns up
the thermostat when you're not there.

180
00:09:42,319 --> 00:09:45,470
Ugh. It's like
walking into the Amazon.

181
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:47,590
And not the good Amazon
with one-day shipping.

182
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,075
The awful one with birds and snakes.

183
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,555
You hate the sound of all
those keys on his key chain.

184
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,556
Four keys!

185
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:57,795
Who does he think he is, a warden?

186
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:01,351
See? Maybe you'll love living alone.

187
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,028
I don't know. Perhaps.

188
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,199
And if it turns out you don't...
you and I could live together.

189
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,435
You and--
Oh, sure.

190
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,351
And while we're at it,
why don't we get engaged, too?

191
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,357
Why don't we get a little house,
start a family?

192
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,836
Enjoy our sunset years together?
Do you hear yourself, woman?

193
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:23,268
-Sheldon, it was just a thought.
-No. Here's a thought.

194
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:25,470
You're not moving in,
Leonard's not moving out,

195
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,716
everything stays
exactly the way it is.

196
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,911
And by the way, I saw you make
this Strawberry Ouik with syrup,

197
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,588
and you're supposed
to use the powder!

198
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,435
-It tastes the same.
-No. The syrup tastes better,

199
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:38,038
and I don't like it.

200
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,959
This is so sweet!
You never cook for me.

201
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:46,798
Well, you cook for me
all the time and...

202
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,074
(GROANS)

203
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,959
If you don't like my cooking,
why haven't you ever said anything?

204
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:55,356
It's hard to talk
with so much heavy chewing to do.

205
00:10:57,079 --> 00:10:59,957
-Sorry. I'll get better.
-I know you'll try.

206
00:11:01,999 --> 00:11:04,388
So, should we talk
about setting a date?

207
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:06,988
Well, I'd like to pick one that works
with my brother's schedule.

208
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:08,598
Okay, and when would that be?

209
00:11:09,319 --> 00:11:11,787
Uh, 12 to 18 months from now,
depending on good behavior.

210
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:13,629
(KNOCKING)

211
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,989
-Hi, is Sheldon here?
-No, I thought he was with you.

212
00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:18,951
He was, but he stormed off.

213
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,151
-Now he isn't answering his phone.
-What happened?

214
00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:23,315
He was really angry
that you suggested he move out.

215
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,668
Oh.

216
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:26,517
I also mentioned
that he and I could live together,

217
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:29,233
but he was too mad at you to realize
what a great idea that is.

218
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:33,636
Well, he's been having
a couple of tough days.

219
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:34,828
I'm sure he's fine.

220
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,394
He probablyjust needs
a little alone time to decompress.

221
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,431
You're probably right.

222
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:41,311
So, what are you guys doing?

223
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,990
Well, Leonard cooked for me and now
we're just having a nice dinner,

224
00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:49,474
you know, as a newly engaged couple.

225
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,033
That's nice.

226
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,312
Anyway, as l was saying,

227
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:01,079
Sheldon probablyjust
needs a little alone time.

228
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:05,069
'Cause that's important.

229
00:12:07,439 --> 00:12:09,430
Not just for him, but for...

230
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:12,191
most anybody, really.

231
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,390
Don't I know it.

232
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,113
-What is that, polenta?
-Amy, get out.

233
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,355
Right.

234
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,750
No.

235
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,590
Hey, Sheldon.

236
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,278
What happened?

237
00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:32,197
l was cooking
in the back room last night

238
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,108
-and the hot plate caught on fire.
-And you couldn't put it out?

239
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:38,787
l was across the street
at the do-it-yourself car wash,

240
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:40,227
taking a shower.

241
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,839
So when will you reopen?

242
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,392
Um, I don't know. I'm waiting to hear
back from the insurance company.

243
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,872
So, tomorrow?

244
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,071
I don't mean to be rude,
Sheldon, but,

245
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,157
my life is kind of
falling apart right now.

246
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,509
Your life?

247
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,109
The university is making me
do string theory,

248
00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:04,516
and my girlfriend loves me
so much she wants to live with me.

249
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,959
And now, the place I need to go when
I'm sad is damp and smells funny.

250
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,678
Well, sorryl let you down.

251
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:16,347
No, I do not accept this.

252
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,596
Everything is changing and I hate it.

253
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,314
It stops now. I'm helping you
get back on your feet.

254
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:26,028
I would like to purchase
this comic book, please.

255
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,235
That'll be $2.99.

256
00:13:29,439 --> 00:13:31,873
Really? lt's soaking wet.

257
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,830
Fine, a dollar.

258
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:39,798
-Can you break a 20?
-No, | only have hundreds.

259
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,313
You know what?

260
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,669
I don't always recognize sarcasm,
but I do right now,

261
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:47,710
and I don't appreciate it.

262
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:49,318
I'm sorry for your loss.

263
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,192
But you're not the only one
whose day has been a disaster.

264
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,838
That could have killed me.

265
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,674
I can't catch a break.

266
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,036
(INDISTINCT CHATTER ON TV)

267
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,549
I haven't heard from Sheldon
in a while. You think he's okay?

268
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:10,908
Oh, I'm sure he's fine.

269
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,836
I'm gonna see where he is.

270
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:14,949
H ow?

271
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,151
I know his password,
so I can track his phone.

272
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,679
You do that?

273
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,712
Not always, but ever since
he wandered off at the swap meet

274
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,797
chasing a balloon, | get worried.

275
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:26,312
He can take care of himself.

276
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,956
Look, we went over stranger danger
and gave him that whistle.

277
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,029
That's weird.

278
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,549
-What?
-He's at the train station.

279
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:35,874
So? He loves trains.

280
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,071
lt's dark out and he's alone,
I don't like it. Let's go get him.

281
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,430
Oh, it's sweet how you look out
for him. You're a good guy.

282
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,915
Not just that. My mother would kill
me if I let something happen to him.

283
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,359
-Dude, I'm so sorry.
-Don't take this the wrong way,

284
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,994
but did you do this
for the insurance money?

285
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,236
No. God, you sound
like the police, the firemen,

286
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,000
my parents, my therapist
and the insurance company.

287
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,755
We're here for you, man.
Whatever you need, okay?

288
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,519
Actually, I was wondering if I could
crash at your place for a few nights.

289
00:15:09,719 --> 00:15:12,552
Sure, of course. Oh, actually,
Emily was gonna spend the night.

290
00:15:13,439 --> 00:15:15,430
You slept with her? Nice.

291
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:19,029
Well, I can't take all the credit.
She let me do it to her, but...

292
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,598
But I can always
call her and cancel.

293
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,950
Hang on.
I know a place you can stay,

294
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,036
and earn some money at the same time.

295
00:15:28,239 --> 00:15:29,957
-Great.
-| just have to warn you,

296
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:33,788
it'll involve humiliation,
degradation and verbal abuse.

297
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:37,035
So what's the catch?

298
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,909
Sheldon.

299
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:46,357
You tracked my phone?

300
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,709
Yeah.

301
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,390
Boy, you chase one balloon
for three miles.

302
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,397
We were worried about you.

303
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,556
Don't be melodramatic.

304
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,512
I'm just getting on a train
and leaving forever.

305
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,157
Seriously? You don't even have
a change of clothes or a toothbrush.

306
00:16:05,359 --> 00:16:08,032
My plan is to stop
at malls and buy what I need.

307
00:16:08,239 --> 00:16:09,991
It's called living off the land.

308
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,110
Okay, I know you're upset
and there's a lot of stuff going on,

309
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:17,152
but it's nothing we can't work out.
Come on, let's get you home.

310
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:20,988
No. I've reached my breaking point.
I need to leave. Now.

311
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,633
-And go Where?
-It doesn't matter.

312
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,797
So a few things don't go your way,

313
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:30,594
and your best decision
is to ride the rails like a hobo?

314
00:16:32,719 --> 00:16:34,277
I suppose it is.

315
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,198
Except I have a credit card.

316
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,278
And I refuse to carry
my laptop at the end of a stick.

317
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,999
And I'd sooner die
than eat beans out of a can.

318
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,040
Come on, come home with us and
tomorrow I'll take you to Legoland.

319
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:51,753
Legoland is not
the solution to everything.

320
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:55,950
And it's too much of a scene
since that movie came out.

321
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:01,076
-Then what can I do?
-Leonard, I am overwhelmed.

322
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,879
Everything is changing
and it's simply too much.

323
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,478
I need to get away and think.

324
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:09,273
Oh, come on,
you know you're overreacting.

325
00:17:09,479 --> 00:17:12,118
Leonard, hang on.
Just... come here for a second.

326
00:17:14,479 --> 00:17:15,878
Maybe we need to let him go.

327
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,752
-What! Why?
-It might be good for him.

328
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,632
You know he can't
take a trip like this by himself.

329
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,752
-He's a grown man.
-No, he looks like a grown man.

330
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,315
You've seen Freaky Friday,
sometimes little kids

331
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,397
end up in big person bodies.

332
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,471
Leonard,
we can't protect him forever.

333
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:37,671
-I know, but--
-He'll be okay.

334
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,393
You taught him well, Padawan.

335
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,798
Good Lord! Padawan's the student,
not the teacher.

336
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,237
Seriously, let him go.

337
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:56,033
Sheldon, if you really need to
do this, I won't stand in your way.

338
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,270
I do.

339
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,273
Okay. Good luck.

340
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:08,351
Be safe and call us.

341
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,509
lwill.

342
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,830
Bye, buddy.

343
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:23,109
-Sheldon...
-Yes?

344
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,549
I'm gonna miss you.

345
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,951
Of course you are.

346
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,198
He just made that easier.

347
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,438
Hey!

348
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,238
What are you guys still doing here?
I got this, go. Go home.

349
00:18:49,999 --> 00:18:51,671
You sure?

350
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,679
Yeah, she's fed, she took her pills,
she's all tucked in and watching TV.

351
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:57,712
So, she's not too much for you?

352
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,558
Are you kidding?
I love her, she's great.

353
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:04,554
WOMAN: Stewie, you gonna watch
Wheel of Fortune with me?

354
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:06,590
Coming, Debbie.

355
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,153
-You call her Debbie?
-She insisted.

356
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:13,674
So, hey, guys, thank you so much.

357
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,598
This job is a dream come true.

358
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,872
Was that a little weird?

359
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,114
Yeah.

360
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,551
I don't know why,
but something about it feels...

361
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,273
...unnatural.

362
00:19:32,719 --> 00:19:34,277
-Okay, let's go.
-Yep.

363
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,757
Okay, Sheldon,
thanks for checking in.

364
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,757
Talk to you tomorrow?

365
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:42,358
Okay, bye.

366
00:19:43,439 --> 00:19:44,838
He's okay?

367
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,678
Actually sounds like
he's doing pretty well.

368
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,950
I really think
this is gonna be for the best.

369
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:52,310
Me too. And he was able
to take a sabbatical from--

370
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,750
How could you let him go!

371
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,277
