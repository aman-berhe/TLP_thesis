How's your mom holding up?

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,233
She's doing okay,
but we just lost another nurse.

3
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:10,428
How many is that new?

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,950
Two, and I know what you're
thinking: she's eating them.

5
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:18,315
She's just so impossible,
they keep quitting.

6
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:19,872
So, who's watching her new?

7
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:23,276
A bowl full of MEM's
with a few Ambien tossed in.

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,870
What up, guys?

9
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:25,989
-He||o.
-Hey.

10
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,390
Okay, well, now that everyone's here,

11
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,749
Penny and l have some big news.

12
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,510
We're engaged!

13
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,517
Oh, my God! Congratulations!

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,989
And I thought me having sex with
Emily was gonna be the big news.

15

(ALL CHEERING)

16
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:47,115
-Oh, my God!
-Hey! Hey!

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,352
What the hell!

18
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,276
You guys propose all the time.
This never happens.

19
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:56,558
You're right!

21
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,071
Boy, I'm so hungrytoday.

22
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:27,558
I wonder why?

23
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,998
Because you had sex the other night?

24
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,559
You know what?

25
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,397
That may be it.

26
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:38,916
By the way,
it isn't like riding a bike.

27
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,837
Like, I fell off a few times.

28
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:45,789
-Hey, buddy.
-Hello.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,069
You okay?

30
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,990
ljust got called
into President Siebert's office.

31
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,957
The university
won't let me switch my field

32
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,548
of study to inflationary
cosmology.

33
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,227
They're forcing me
to continue with string theory.

34
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,237
-Why?
-He said it's why they hired me,

35
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:04,350
it's what my grant
was designated for,

36
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,757
and that everybody has to
do things they don't want to do.

37
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,757
He then gave an example
of something he had to do,

38
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,712
even though he didn't want to,
which was look at my stupid face.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,197
That's a rude thing to say out loud.

40
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:24,035
It's an outrage. Honestly, I'm
tempted to leave the university.

41
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,116
You know, if you're
really serious about that,

42
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,514
I hear there are some
exciting opportunities

43
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:30,789
in home care for the old and fat.

44
00:02:32,359 --> 00:02:34,919
Whatever you do,
just don't make any rash decisions.

45
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,634
I don't know. I am really aggravated.

46
00:02:38,799 --> 00:02:41,108
When I'm feeling low,
I have sex with a girl.

47
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,712
But that's just me.

48
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,717
-Oh, come on, give her a chance.
-No.

49
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,035
No, life, it is too short.

50
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,512
I know you've only been here
a day and a half,

51
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,471
but you're like part of the family!

52
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,479
I don't think the service
is gonna send any more people.

53
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:07,389
Yeah, maybe it's time we just
release Ma back into the sea.

54
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,829
That's not helpful.

55
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,793
Well, then, we may need
to get used to the idea

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,992
that we're gonna be living here
the next few months.

57
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,272
But we have jobs.
We can't babysit her 24 hours a day.

58
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,074
Well, what if we use
our vacation time?

59
00:03:23,279 --> 00:03:26,749
I wanted to go to Hawaii, not Hell.

60
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,712
I don't know what else we can do.

your mother is every bit

as she is yours, so...

00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,311
...I want a divorce.

64
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,075
Hello, Leonard.

65
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:46,553
Hi, Mom.

66
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,432
l have some exciting news.

67
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:51,153
I'm listening.

68
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:54,069
Before I tell you,
will you promise to try

69
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:57,635
and be happy for me and keep
any concerns you have to yourself?

70
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,635
No.

71
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,037
Let me save you all
of your hemming and hawing.

72
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,038
Sheldon already told me
that you and Penny are engaged.

73
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:12,187
I hate that you talk to him
more than you talk to me.

74
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,595
Would you like for you
and me to talk more?

75
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,389
You know what? It's probably fine.

76
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:22,636
In any event,
while I've had my misgivings

77
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,830
about... Penny...

78
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,310
...Sheldon spoke very fondly of her,

79
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,238
and if she is good enough for him,

80
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,351
then she's good enough for me.

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,356
I'm your son. What about the fact
that she's good enough for me?

82
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,833
Sure.

83
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,315
Thanks, Mom.

84
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:46,237
Leonard, would it make
you feel better

85
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,319
to hear that your mother
approved of your life choices?

86
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,194
Yes, it would.

87
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:56,550
Yeah, well, you should work on that.

88
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,599
No, Mom, it's the same guy I've gone
out with for the past two years.

89
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:06,710
Yeah, the scientist.

90
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:11,072
Well, it's complicated. I mean, he
works with lasers and atomic magnets.

91
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,631
No, I did not see it coming.

92
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:19,797
No, we did not set a date.
No, I'm not pregnant.

93
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:23,515
Yeah, this is a first for our family.

94
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,947
All right, tell Dad I love him.
I gotta go. All right, bye.

95
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,277

-Shut up.

-Thanks.

Little warning before you jump
into this marriage business:

101
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,190
you're notjust marrying him,
you're marrying his family.

102
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,436
I think Leonard's mom's okay with me.

103
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,630
It doesn't matter if she's okay
with you. The question is:

104
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,750
can she go
to the bathroom by herself?

105
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,632

106
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,355
So, what are the living
arrangements gonna be?

107
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:03,709
Well, haven't really talked
about it yet, but I figure,

108
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,114
at some point, I'll move in
with him, or he'll move in with me.

109
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,594
Well, with you not working,
that makes financial sense.

like ajob in home health care?

I'm writing an appeal
to the Faculty Senate,

118
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:38,271
so that I can move
on from string theory.

119
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,629
How's it going?

120
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,995

00:06:45,359 --> 00:06:48,078
As you may know, I have requested
to change my field of study.

00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:52,113
My decision to do so is, I believe,
in the best interest of science.

At your convenience,
I'd be happy to explain it to you

in words you'll understand."

you called them esteemed.

I was hoping to float past you.

Now that Penny and l are engaged,

131
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:13,309
I thought we might want to talk
about our living arrangements.

132
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,355
Of course.

133
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:18,198

and you're worried

about preserving the myth
of her virginity before the wedding.

-l'm not.
-Good,

136

because not only
has that ship sailed,

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,592
if it hit an iceberg,
countless men would perish.

138

Actually, this is about
where she and l are going to live.

139
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,512
What do you mean?

140
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,393
Well, well, we might
want to live together.

141
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,592
Oh, yeah, well, I've already
given this some thought,

142
00:07:42,799 --> 00:07:47,031
and I'm willing
to let Penny live with us

143
00:07:47,239 --> 00:07:49,514
one day a week for a trial period.

144
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,159
Now, obviously,
not when she's made cranky

145
00:07:54,359 --> 00:07:56,998
by the shedding
of her uterine lining.

146
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,955
That's very sweet.

00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:05,912
But we were thinking more of us
maybe living together with...

148
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,790
...not you.

149
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:12,437
I don't understand.

How could we all live together
if I'm not there?

this is change,

I don't know.

154
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,077
We just started to think about this.

155
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:28,428
Maybe I'll move in with Penny,

156
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,312
or maybe she and I'll take this
place, you can move across the hall.

157
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:33,396
Move across the hall?

158

No, I did not.

Did you get hit on the head
with a coconut?

161
00:08:44,719 --> 00:08:46,596
-No.
-Well, then, I'm all out of guesses.

162
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,031
What? Me move across the hall-- Why
would you even suggest such a thing?

to give her the life she deserves.

Well, yeah.

167
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,115
Wow.

168
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,071
How dare the university force me
to go back to string theory!

Theyjust don't appreciate you.

170
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,349
Yeah, and on top of that,
Leonard has the audacity

171
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,630
to suggest that now
that he and Penny are engaged,

172
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,716
he may not want
to live with me anymore.

173
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,558
Here, I made you
some Strawberry Ouik.

174
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,397
l have real problems here, Amy.

175
00:09:27,599 --> 00:09:30,159
I can't be mollified with
a beverage designed for children.

176
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,679
Mm. Yummy.

177
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,193
You know,
this might work out for the best.

178
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,471
You're always complaining about
what a terrible roommate Leonard is.

179
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,113
Like how he turns up
the thermostat when you're not there.

180
00:09:42,319 --> 00:09:45,470
Ugh. It's like
walking into the Amazon.

181
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:47,590
And not the good Amazon
with one-day shipping.

182
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,075
The awful one with birds and snakes.

183
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,555
You hate the sound of all
those keys on his key chain.

184
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,556
Four keys!

185
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:57,795
Who does he think he is, a warden?

186
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:01,351
See? Maybe you'll love living alone.

187
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,028
I don't know. Perhaps.

188
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,199
And if it turns out you don't...
you and I could live together.

189
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,435
You and--
Oh, sure.

190
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,351
And while we're at it,
why don't we get engaged, too?

191
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,357
Why don't we get a little house,
start a family?

192
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,836
Enjoy our sunset years together?
Do you hear yourself, woman?

193
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:23,268
-Sheldon, it was just a thought.
-No. Here's a thought.

194
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:25,470
You're not moving in,
Leonard's not moving out,

195
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,716
everything stays
exactly the way it is.

196
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,911
And by the way, I saw you make
this Strawberry Ouik with syrup,

197
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,588
and you're supposed
to use the powder!

198
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,435
-It tastes the same.
-No. The syrup tastes better,

199
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:38,038
and I don't like it.

200
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,959
This is so sweet!
You never cook for me.

201
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:46,798
Well, you cook for me
all the time and...

202
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,074
(GROANS)

203
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,959
If you don't like my cooking,
why haven't you ever said anything?

204
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:55,356
It's hard to talk
with so much heavy chewing to do.

205
00:10:57,079 --> 00:10:59,957
-Sorry. I'll get better.
-I know you'll try.

206
00:11:01,999 --> 00:11:04,388
So, should we talk
about setting a date?

207
00:11:04,599 --> 00:11:06,988
Well, I'd like to pick one that works
with my brother's schedule.

208
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:08,598
Okay, and when would that be?

209
00:11:09,319 --> 00:11:11,787
Uh, 12 to 18 months from now,
depending on good behavior.

210
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:13,629
(KNOCKING)

211
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,989
-Hi, is Sheldon here?
-No, I thought he was with you.

212
00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:18,951
He was, but he stormed off.

213
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,151
-Now he isn't answering his phone.
-What happened?

214
00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:23,315
He was really angry
that you suggested he move out.

215
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,668
Oh.

216
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:26,517
I also mentioned
that he and I could live together,

217
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:29,233
but he was too mad at you to realize
what a great idea that is.

218
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:33,636
Well, he's been having
a couple of tough days.

219
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:34,828
I'm sure he's fine.

220
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,394
He probablyjust needs
a little alone time to decompress.

221
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,431
You're probably right.

222
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:41,311
So, what are you guys doing?

223
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,990
Well, Leonard cooked for me and now
we're just having a nice dinner,

224
00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:49,474
you know, as a newly engaged couple.

225
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,033
That's nice.

226
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,312
Anyway, as l was saying,

227
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:01,079
Sheldon probablyjust
needs a little alone time.

228
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:05,069
'Cause that's important.

229
00:12:07,439 --> 00:12:09,430
Not just for him, but for...

230
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:12,191
most anybody, really.

231
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,390
Don't I know it.

232
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,113
-What is that, polenta?
-Amy, get out.

233
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,355
Right.

234
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,750
No.

235
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,590
Hey, Sheldon.

236
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,278
What happened?

237
00:12:30,479 --> 00:12:32,197
l was cooking
in the back room last night

238
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,108
-and the hot plate caught on fire.
-And you couldn't put it out?

239
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:38,787
l was across the street
at the do-it-yourself car wash,

240
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:40,227
taking a shower.

241
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,839
So when will you reopen?

242
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,392
Um, I don't know. I'm waiting to hear
back from the insurance company.

243
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,872
So, tomorrow?

244
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,071
I don't mean to be rude,
Sheldon, but,

245
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,157
my life is kind of
falling apart right now.

246
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,509
Your life?

247
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,109
The university is making me
do string theory,

248
00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:04,516
and my girlfriend loves me
so much she wants to live with me.

249
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,959
And now, the place I need to go when
I'm sad is damp and smells funny.

250
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,678
Well, sorryl let you down.

251
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:16,347
No, I do not accept this.

252
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,596
Everything is changing and I hate it.

253
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,314
It stops now. I'm helping you
get back on your feet.

254
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:26,028
I would like to purchase
this comic book, please.

255
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,235
That'll be $2.99.

256
00:13:29,439 --> 00:13:31,873
Really? lt's soaking wet.

257
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,830
Fine, a dollar.

258
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:39,798
-Can you break a 20?
-No, | only have hundreds.

259
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,313
You know what?

260
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,669
I don't always recognize sarcasm,
but I do right now,

261
00:13:45,879 --> 00:13:47,710
and I don't appreciate it.

262
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:49,318
I'm sorry for your loss.

263
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,192
But you're not the only one
whose day has been a disaster.

264
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,838
That could have killed me.

265
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,674
I can't catch a break.

266
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,036
(INDISTINCT CHATTER ON TV)

267
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,549
I haven't heard from Sheldon
in a while. You think he's okay?

268
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:10,908
Oh, I'm sure he's fine.

269
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,836
I'm gonna see where he is.

270
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:14,949
H ow?

271
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,151
I know his password,
so I can track his phone.

272
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,679
You do that?

273
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,712
Not always, but ever since
he wandered off at the swap meet

274
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,797
chasing a balloon, | get worried.

275
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:26,312
He can take care of himself.

276
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,956
Look, we went over stranger danger
and gave him that whistle.

277
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,029
That's weird.

278
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,549
-What?
-He's at the train station.

279
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:35,874
So? He loves trains.

280
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,071
lt's dark out and he's alone,
I don't like it. Let's go get him.

281
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,430
Oh, it's sweet how you look out
for him. You're a good guy.

282
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,915
Not just that. My mother would kill
me if I let something happen to him.

283
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,359
-Dude, I'm so sorry.
-Don't take this the wrong way,

284
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,994
but did you do this
for the insurance money?

285
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,236
No. God, you sound
like the police, the firemen,

286
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,000
my parents, my therapist
and the insurance company.

287
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,755
We're here for you, man.
Whatever you need, okay?

288
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,519
Actually, I was wondering if I could
crash at your place for a few nights.

289
00:15:09,719 --> 00:15:12,552
Sure, of course. Oh, actually,
Emily was gonna spend the night.

290
00:15:13,439 --> 00:15:15,430
You slept with her? Nice.

291
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:19,029
Well, I can't take all the credit.
She let me do it to her, but...

292
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,598
But I can always
call her and cancel.

293
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,950
Hang on.
I know a place you can stay,

294
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,036
and earn some money at the same time.

295
00:15:28,239 --> 00:15:29,957
-Great.
-| just have to warn you,

296
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:33,788
it'll involve humiliation,
degradation and verbal abuse.

297
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:37,035
So what's the catch?

298
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,909
Sheldon.

299
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:46,357
You tracked my phone?

300
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,709
Yeah.

301
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,390
Boy, you chase one balloon
for three miles.

302
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,397
We were worried about you.

303
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,556
Don't be melodramatic.

304
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,512
I'm just getting on a train
and leaving forever.

305
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,157
Seriously? You don't even have
a change of clothes or a toothbrush.

306
00:16:05,359 --> 00:16:08,032
My plan is to stop
at malls and buy what I need.

307
00:16:08,239 --> 00:16:09,991
It's called living off the land.

308
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,110
Okay, I know you're upset
and there's a lot of stuff going on,

309
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:17,152
but it's nothing we can't work out.
Come on, let's get you home.

310
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:20,988
No. I've reached my breaking point.
I need to leave. Now.

311
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,633
-And go Where?
-It doesn't matter.

312
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,797
So a few things don't go your way,

313
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:30,594
and your best decision
is to ride the rails like a hobo?

314
00:16:32,719 --> 00:16:34,277
I suppose it is.

315
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,198
Except I have a credit card.

316
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,278
And I refuse to carry
my laptop at the end of a stick.

317
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,999
And I'd sooner die
than eat beans out of a can.

318
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,040
Come on, come home with us and
tomorrow I'll take you to Legoland.

319
00:16:49,239 --> 00:16:51,753
Legoland is not
the solution to everything.

320
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:55,950
And it's too much of a scene
since that movie came out.

321
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:01,076
-Then what can I do?
-Leonard, I am overwhelmed.

322
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,879
Everything is changing
and it's simply too much.

323
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,478
I need to get away and think.

324
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:09,273
Oh, come on,
you know you're overreacting.

325
00:17:09,479 --> 00:17:12,118
Leonard, hang on.
Just... come here for a second.

326
00:17:14,479 --> 00:17:15,878
Maybe we need to let him go.

327
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,752
-What! Why?
-It might be good for him.

328
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,632
You know he can't
take a trip like this by himself.

329
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,752
-He's a grown man.
-No, he looks like a grown man.

330
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,315
You've seen Freaky Friday,
sometimes little kids

331
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,397
end up in big person bodies.

332
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,471
Leonard,
we can't protect him forever.

333
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:37,671
-I know, but--
-He'll be okay.

334
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,393
You taught him well, Padawan.

335
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,798
Good Lord! Padawan's the student,
not the teacher.

336
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,237
Seriously, let him go.

337
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:56,033
Sheldon, if you really need to
do this, I won't stand in your way.

338
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,270
I do.

339
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,273
Okay. Good luck.

340
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:08,351
Be safe and call us.

341
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,509
lwill.

342
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,830
Bye, buddy.

343
00:18:20,959 --> 00:18:23,109
-Sheldon...
-Yes?

344
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,549
I'm gonna miss you.

345
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,951
Of course you are.

346
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,198
He just made that easier.

347
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,438
Hey!

348
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,238
What are you guys still doing here?
I got this, go. Go home.

349
00:18:49,999 --> 00:18:51,671
You sure?

350
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,679
Yeah, she's fed, she took her pills,
she's all tucked in and watching TV.

351
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:57,712
So, she's not too much for you?

352
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,558
Are you kidding?
I love her, she's great.

353
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:04,554
WOMAN: Stewie, you gonna watch
Wheel of Fortune with me?

354
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:06,590
Coming, Debbie.

355
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,153
-You call her Debbie?
-She insisted.

356
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:13,674
So, hey, guys, thank you so much.

357
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,598
This job is a dream come true.

358
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,872
Was that a little weird?

359
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,114
Yeah.

360
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,551
I don't know why,
but something about it feels...

361
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,273
...unnatural.

362
00:19:32,719 --> 00:19:34,277
-Okay, let's go.
-Yep.

363
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,757
Okay, Sheldon,
thanks for checking in.

364
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,757
Talk to you tomorrow?

365
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:42,358
Okay, bye.

366
00:19:43,439 --> 00:19:44,838
He's okay?

367
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,678
Actually sounds like
he's doing pretty well.

368
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,950
I really think
this is gonna be for the best.

369
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:52,310
Me too. And he was able
to take a sabbatical from--

370
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,750
How could you let him go!

371
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,277
