00:00:04,279 --> 00:00:05,712
We were worried about you.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,912
Don't be melodramatic.

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,117
I'm just getting on a train
and leaving forever.

5
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:14,474
A few things don't go your way...

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,189
...and your best decision is to
ride the rails like a hobo?

7
00:00:18,759 --> 00:00:20,431
Leonard, I am overwhelmed.

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,713
Everything is changing
and it's simply too much.

9
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:25,517
I need to get away and think.

10
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,555
-Sheldon.
-Yes?

11
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,348
I'm gonna miss you.

12
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:32,910
Of course you are.

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,551
-You just made that easier.
PENNY: Mm-hm.

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,996
Excuse me.

15
00:00:45,999 --> 00:00:49,469
Is it at all possible
that you're knitting a pair of pants?

16
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,749
Oh, no. You're understandably terrified.

17
00:00:53,919 --> 00:00:55,671
You know, allow me to explain.

18
00:00:55,839 --> 00:00:57,397
Forty-five days ago...

19
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:00,312
...um, I embarked on
a railroad journey of healing...

20
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:03,391
...because my university
was making me do string theory...

21
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,551
...my favorite comic book store
burned down...

22
00:01:05,719 --> 00:01:09,553
...and when my roommate got engaged,
my girlfriend wanted to move in with me.

23
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:12,153
Which was no doubt a ployjust to see my...

24
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,596
...well, excuse my language,
but my bathing suit parts.

25
00:01:18,399 --> 00:01:20,196
Sir, may I use your phone?

26
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,112
I don't think so.

27
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,872
I understand that I'm half-naked...

28
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:28,112
...but there is a reasonable explanation.
While I slept in my sleeper car...

29
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,998
...all my possessions were stolen.

30
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,275
Now, typically, I wear pajamas...

31
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:36,068
...butl recently adopted a hobo lifestyle...

32
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,516
...and pajamas are
the sleep-pants of the man.

33
00:01:41,919 --> 00:01:44,274
I'll have you know
Mahatma Gandhi wore no pants...

34
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,237
...and a nation rallied behind him!

35
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,949
My good man, now, before you walk away,
I know that I may appear deranged...

36
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,680
...but I am, in fact,
a world-renowned physicist.

37
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,913
Ask me the difference between
a boson and fermion. Go ahead, ask.

38
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,436
Bosons have integer spin.

39
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,556
Fermions have half-integer spin.

40
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,428
My legs are getting cold.
Why won't anybody help me?

41
00:02:34,559 --> 00:02:37,027
-Morning.
-Hi. Want to do yoga with me?

42
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,872
Uh, let me just have some coffee first...

43
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,749
...and then I'll have the strength
to tell you how much I won't be doing that.

-Hello, Leonard.

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,796
Hey, buddy. Good to hear your voice.

47
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,950
I'm in Kingman, Arizona...

48
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,237

I'd love to, I'm just about to
do yoga with Penny.

50
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,153
Leonard, I'm at the police station.
I was robbed.

51
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,710
They took my phone,
my wallet, my iPad, everything.

52
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,598
-Oh, my God. Are you okay?
-No, I'm not okay.

53
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,320
I'm wearing borrowed pants...

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,595
...I don't have ID...

55
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,435
...and one of the officers here
won't stop calling me Chicken Legs.

00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,758
Okay, I'll come get you.

57
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,910

-Okay.
SHELDON: Hurry.

60
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:31,278
Sheldon, hang tight.
Hey, do you want me to bring anything?

61
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,350
Yes, please. A pair of pants.

62
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:34,952
And my toothbrush.

63
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,590
And my mail. And a really good
comeback for Chicken Legs...

64
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,038
...because, "I know you are, but what am I?"
was met with stony silence.

65
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,713
I'll be there as soon as I can.

66
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,677
-Is he okay?
-Yeah, he's fine. He's just a little rattled.

67
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,877
-Feel like driving to Arizona?
-I can't. I have thatjob interview.

-Right.
-Besides, I don't need six hours of:

Why did you change?

I'm holding my breath
until your hair grows back."

All right, fine.

00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:03,397
Can you think of a reason
I shouldn't invite Amy to come with me?

00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:06,471
-No.
-Come on, you didn't even try.

-Thanks for the lift.
-What's wrong with your car?

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,078
I'm having my windows untinted.

76
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,868
Why?

77
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:18,951
I got a hot girlfriend now.
I want the haters to know.

78
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,000

No one's paying attention to you.

Wow.

Hey, this isn't the way to work.

82
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,438

-I thought Stuart was looking after her.
-He was.

84
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,235
But now that her cast is off, he moved out.

85
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:39,197
And, honestly, I'm kind of glad.
It was getting a little weird.

-How so?
-I don't know.

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,309
No, not like us. Creepy chummy.

90
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,470
Like you and your dog.

She feeds him out of her own mouth?

92
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,588
I mean, he calls her Debbie,
she calls him Stewie...

93
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:00,829
...and they're all giggly around each other.

94
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:04,389
And believe me, when food goes
in that mouth, it does not come out.

95
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:08,635
So are you worried because
he's replacing you as a son...

96
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,598
...or are you worried because
he's becoming her lover?

97

First of all, no one can replace me as a son.

"When you eliminate the impossible...

the bikini carwash I did in school...

...but you already made me
take that off my résumé.

A butterfly could've gotten
himself home from Arizona.

334
00:18:51,439 --> 00:18:52,792
Yeah, I feel renewed.

335
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,999
I'm ready to deal with
any changes that come my way.

336
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,868
-Hey. Look who's back.
-Hey.

337
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:03,554
Your hair is different. You changed
your hair. I can't take this. I'm out.

338
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,310
-Like to see pictures from my trip?
-I thought your phone got stolen.

339
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,155
It did, but luckily, all my photos
got backed up to the cloud.

340
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,880
And you thought they all had a silver lining.

341
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,958
Here, day one.

342
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,156
This was the seat I was going to sit in...

343
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:25,356
...but didn't because there were
cracker crumbs on it.

344
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,352
And as it was first-class, I suspect Ritz.

345
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:32,878
This is the train bathroom.

346
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,032
This is the lmodium I took so I would
never have to use the train bathroom.

347
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,516
I can't believe you traveled the country
and never left the train station.

348
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,275
I know. You know, I almost died
in afire in Des Moines, but I stayed put.

349
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,708
FYI, that's when the lmodium gave out.

350
