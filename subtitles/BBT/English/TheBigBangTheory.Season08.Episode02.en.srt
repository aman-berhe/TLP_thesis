00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,268
I recently read that during World War II...

2
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:09,715
...Joseph Stalin had a research program
to create super soldiers...

3
00:00:09,879 --> 00:00:13,269
...by having women impregnated
by gorillas.

any other animals.

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,232
Hippos are the deadliest creature.

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,233
A half-human, half-hippo soldier
would be pretty badass.

9

Yes, but when they're hungry, hungry,
you can stop them with marbles.

Yeah, the correct animal
for interspecies super soldier is koala.
