1
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,510
So how does this work?
I throw it like a real ball?

2
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:08,755
Yeah, nice and easy, right over the plate.

3
00:00:08,959 --> 00:00:10,551
All right.

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,194
You suck, Wolowitz!

5
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:14,908
What's that about?

6
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:17,553
I'm heckling you.
It's a beloved part of baseball.

7
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:20,709
He's right.
Given that you're probably still waiting...

8
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:24,394
...to be picked for a game in fifth grade,
I'm sure you do suck.

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,951
-Hi. What's going on?
-Baseball.

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,118
Okay, this is not whatl meant
when I said go outside and play.

11
00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:33,830
-He's practicing.
-For what?

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,314
The Angels wanted an astronaut to throw
out the first pitch. So guess who they called?

13
00:00:39,519 --> 00:00:40,793
What? You? Really?

14
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:43,957
Well, a lot of people
who weren't available, but then me.

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,433
That's so cool. Congratulations. I guess
that makes you the athlete of the group.

16
00:00:49,639 --> 00:00:53,029
Well, notjust him.
May I remind you that you're talking...

17
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,838
...to the seeker, beater, chaser
and water boy...

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,798
...of the third place Griffith Park Quidditch
team.

19
00:00:58,999 --> 00:01:01,991
Watching your boyfriend run around
with a broomstick between his legs...

20
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,752
...isn't something you forget.

21
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,873
-Come on. Now, throw one.
-All right, here we go.

22
00:01:08,399 --> 00:01:10,594
You look like ajackass!

23
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,351
-Cut it out. You're hurting my feelings.
-Now you know why we're not outside.

24
00:01:40,279 --> 00:01:42,031
Did you enjoy my lecture?

25
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,073
No, and neither did our waiter.

26
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,271
If you're going to serve
Cornish game hen...

27
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:52,069
...you should be familiar with the history
of Cornwall or be prepared to learn it.

28
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,753
It's hard to argue with that.

29
00:01:54,919 --> 00:01:59,435
And I know because I saw a sad man
with a pepper mill desperately try and fail.

30
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:07,795
-Hey. How was dinner?
-Good, I had Cornish game hen.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,116
Oh, that poor waiter.

32
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:13,914
Sheldon, how about tomorrow
we see a movie?

33
00:02:14,079 --> 00:02:15,990
You guys are going out
two nights in a row?

34
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:19,356
I missed a number of date nights
while I was on my train trip.

35
00:02:19,559 --> 00:02:21,470
I'm contractually obligated
to make them up...

36
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:23,789
...under the terms of the relationship
agreement.

37
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:26,436
That's so hot.

38
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,834
It's better than hot, it's binding.

39
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,719
If you're free tomorrow night,
I'd love to have you join us on a double date.

40
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,068
Aw.

41
00:02:37,359 --> 00:02:40,908
You are aware that a double date
doesn't count as two dates.

42
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,553
Oh.

43
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,151
Well, then come or don't. I don't care.

44
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,315
Can't believe you're sore.

45
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,796
Hey, even professional pitchers
need a rubdown after the game.

46
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,718
They throw an actual ball.
You were throwing air at a TV.

47
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,155
For your information,
I also gave Leonard one hell of a high five.

48
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,430
I'm surprised you agreed to do this
in front of a stadium full of people.

49
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,189
Well, they're doing Space Day and NASA
asked me. I felt like I couldn't say no.

50
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,751
Okay. If you want, I could help you practice.
I played a lot of softball growing up.

51
00:03:20,279 --> 00:03:21,917
Thank you, that would be great.

52
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,715
While we're at it, maybe we can butch up
your run for when you head to the mound.

53
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:28,997
What's wrong with the way I run?

54
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,034
Just kidding. Nothing.

55
00:03:39,559 --> 00:03:42,278
Sheldon, I'm surprised
you'd choose to go to a pub.

56
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:46,228
At our committee meeting,
Amy made a motion for a picnic in a park...

57
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:50,796
...but I tacked so many amendments
on that thing it sank like a lead balloon.

58
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,713
I then suggested a pub.

59
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:55,035
Yeah, which I was initially skeptical of...

60
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,998
...until I saw online that they serve
Yorkshire pudding.

61
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,959
You don't like Yorkshire pudding.

62
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,553
No, it's yucky, but informing people about
the history of Yorkshire is yummy, yum, yum.

63
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,117
After a lively debate,
that proposal passed by a two-zero margin.

64
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,390
Nice to see a busy couple
keep the spark of bureaucracy alive.

65
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,348
SHELDON:
Ignore them, Amy.

66
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,111
They're justjealous because they'll never
have a relationship as good as ours.

67
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:27,315
PENNY: Isn't this when he says
"bazooka" or something?

68
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:29,038
SHELDON:
I wasn't making ajoke...

69
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,713
...l was merely stating facts.

70
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:34,508
Amy and l
have a superior relationship to yours.

71
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,280
You don't honestly think that, do you?

72
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:40,357
Leonard, I assumed you knew.

73
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,234
The ranking of relationships
in our circle, by quality...

74
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,234
...is me and Amy, Howard and Bernadette,
Raj and his girlfriend...

75
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,591
...Penny and chardonnay, Penny and you.

76
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,277
LEONARD:
There isn't any ranking.

77
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,994
And if there were,
we wouldn't be at the bottom of it.

78
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,476
Yeah. And actually, I drink sauvignon blanc.

79
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,637
That's the part you have a problem with?

80
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,554
Relax.

81
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:08,954
AMY:
There they go, fighting again.

82
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:12,635
You'd never hear her
talk that way to sauvignon blanc.

83
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,196
So you never played baseball as a kid?
Not even Little League?

84
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,076
l was going to, but the day of tryouts
I found my dad's Playboy collection.

85

Threw my arm out.

86
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,470
All right, the pitcher's mound
in Major League Baseball...

87
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:33,510
...is 60 feet, six inches
away from home plate.

88
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,350
Great. You take this and say when to stop.

89

-How much further?
-Keep going.

90
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,790
-How about now?
-l'll let you know.

91
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:57,077
Are you saying "stop"
and we're just too far away to hear you?

92
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:58,868
Okay, stop.

93
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,998
Are you kidding me?

94
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,354
That's 60 feet.

95
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,869
There's no way this is 60 feet.

96
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:11,035
I'm looking at it.

97
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,357
You realize this isn't one of those times...

98
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:16,589
...I want you to exaggerate
how long something is.

is so wonderful and ours isn't?

So do we.

And I've seen you guys ignore each other
for hours doing totally different things.

104
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,197
It's called "parallel play."

105

Yeah, toddlers do that.

106
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,309
Not as well as we do.

Can you believe this guy?
He has to be the best at everything.

agreement.

13 plucky colonies that entered...

...a relationship agreement
called the U.S. Constitution.

115
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,637
And it may not be cool to say so, but I think
that love affair is still pretty hot today.

...to compare relationships

Everything is quantifiable.

141
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:23,997

143
00:09:30,359 --> 00:09:33,954
Sheldon, you're just assigning random
numbers to things based on your opinion.

144
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:39,028
No, I'm not. French fries have three variables:
crispiness, saltiness and shape.

145
00:09:39,239 --> 00:09:41,469
Which is why a curly fry only gets a two.
