1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,877
Hey, I read that someone invented
a way to convert your footsteps...

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,316
...into electromagnetic energy so you can
charge your cell phone while walking.

3
00:00:10,479 --> 00:00:13,437
We had that idea years ago.
How come we never did anything with it?

4
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,988
Because we left the diagram of it
in the restaurant...

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,230
...and none of us wanted to walk back.

6
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,792
I know the real reason
you never made progress with that idea.

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,918
You thought of it September 22nd, 2007.

8
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:29,469
Two days later, Penny moved in
and so much blood...

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,154
...rushed to your genitals
your brain became a ghost town.

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:35,839
That's not what happened.

11
00:00:35,999 --> 00:00:37,478
I remember it distinctly...

12
00:00:37,639 --> 00:00:40,551
...because I had just composed
my annual poem commemorating...

13
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,757
-...the anniversary of Dr. Seuss' death.
-No one wants to hear it.

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,194
Why, die?

15
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:46,394
Why did he die?

16
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,869
Old, told
[was told he was old

17
00:00:50,639 --> 00:00:53,028
Penny is not the reason
I didn't pursue that idea.

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,193
Oh, really? Since meeting her, what have
been your greatest accomplishments?

19
00:00:57,639 --> 00:01:00,153
Easy. Sleeping with Penny.

20
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:02,833
Getting Penny to go out with him
after she dumped him.

21
00:01:02,999 --> 00:01:05,035
Tricking Penny into getting engaged.

22
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,919
And a few weeks ago,
he almost did a pull-up.

23
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:12,075
I think someone owes me an apology.

24
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,554
Well, don't feel bad.

25
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:18,075
I think we've all been distracted
since the girls entered our lives.

26
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,357
-You admit Amy's a distraction?
-Oh, very much so.

27
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,239
Listen to this. This is from two days ago.

28
00:01:24,399 --> 00:01:26,959
"Hi. Hope you're having a good day."

29
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,076
Who has time for this constant sexting?

30
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,198
Maybe we have lost our focus.

31
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,875
It wouldn't kill us to get together
and brainstorm ideas.

32
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:39,269
Ooh. We could have one of those retreats.

33
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,713
Like our own science retreat.

34
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,873
-My cousin has a cabin out in the woods.
-l'm not going to a cabin in the woods.

35
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:48,156
Did you see the movie
Cabin in the Woods?

36
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,311
-Then we'll go to a hotel.
-A hotel?

37
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,516
Did you see The Shining?

38
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,148
We could go up to Big Bear,
get a house on the lake.

39
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,470
Did you see The Lake House?

40
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,950
Nothing bad happens in The Lake House.

41
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,509
Well, no, not to them. To me.

42
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,675
Time-traveling mailbox.

43
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,310
The only time that traveled was
an hour and a half of my life down the toilet.

44
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,631
-Fine. We'll stay here and do it.
-You didn't suggest a beach house.

45
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,031
-You would go to a beach house?
-Well, good Lord, no. Have you seen Jaws?

46
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,109
-Hey.
-Hey.

47
00:02:43,279 --> 00:02:46,794
So the guys and l are talking about
having a science retreat this weekend.

48
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,157
I wanted to know if that's okay.
You and I talked about going to brunch.

49
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,958
-Wanna go to Vegas this weekend?
-Of course I do.

50
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,350
-Bernadette, girl's weekend, Vegas. You in?
-Yeah.

51
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,159
-Yes. I'll check flights.
-l'll check hotels.

52
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,596
I'll check my underpants.
I'm so excited lthinkl peed.

53
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,988
They seem okay with it.

54
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,348
-Hey.
-Hey.

55
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,271
-I didn't think you'd make it.
-Why not?

56
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,873
You have a steady girlfriend now.

57
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,430
We assumed you'd have to stay home
to lower the food down to her in the pit.

58
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:31,916
For your information,
Emily is working tonight.

59
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,798
One would assume
on getting out of the pit.

60
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:37,508
Okay, let's focus.

61
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,558
The girls are gone, we have 48 hours,
there are no distractions.

62
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:43,187
-Let's change the world.
-Thinking caps on.

63
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,793
-Here we go.
-Ooh. This is exciting.

64
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,553
We're innovating.
I feel like we're in the Facebook movie.

65
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,917
-Oh. I never saw that.
-Really?

66
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,834
It's wonderful. And I swear I'm not saying
that because Justin Timberlake is in it.

67
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,832
Yeah, I have it on Blu-ray.

68
00:03:57,999 --> 00:03:59,114
We should watch it.

69
00:03:59,279 --> 00:04:02,316
Cool. I'll make the popcorn.

70
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,675
Guys, in 30 seconds we went from:

71
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,831
"Let's change the world"
to "Let's watch TV."

72
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:10,509
I'm sorry, is that a no?

73
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,914
Leonard's right. We're here to focus.
Didn't we used to have a list of our ideas?

74
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,559
lthink I still have it.

75
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,030
I did not get a clear answer.
I'm gonna set this down now.

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,718
Ah. Here it is.

77
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:23,994
Heh. Whoa.

78
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,230
I haven't looked at these in years.

79
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,869
-"Robot girlfriend."
-Mmm. That was mine.

80
00:04:30,799 --> 00:04:33,074
"Robot prostitute."

81
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,517
Also mine.

82
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,071
I'm confused. Why would you need both
a robot girlfriend and a robot prostitute?

83
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,073
There's just some things you don't do
with your robot girlfriend.

84
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,435
Boy, when you met Bernadette,
the field of robotics really took a hit.

85
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,275
Okay, let's just skip all the inventions
you can have sex with.

86
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,669
Here we go.

87
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,197
-"Ergonomic heated seat cushion."
-lt vibrates. Keep going.

88
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,909
Know what?
Let's just come up with something new.

89
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,789
A number of significant innovations
have been inspired by science fiction.

90
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:17,792
The geosynchronous satellite
from Arthur C. Clarke.

91
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,555
The Motorola flip phone,
that came from Star Trek.

92
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,190
And I have long suspected that the idea
of an African-American president...

93
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,477
...was stolen from the movie Deep Impact.

94
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,598
Hey, the future they show
in Back to the Future II...

95
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:36,638
...is only a year away. A lot of things
in that movie haven't been invented yet.

96
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:39,359
How cool would it be
if we could make one of those?

97
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:42,556
If we could figure out the scientific basis
for Marty's hoverboard...

98
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,836
...that would have universal application.

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,956
It's possible at absolute zero...

100
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,680
...but we would have to remove
the temperature restrictions.

101
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,149
-Oh, I have an idea.
-I think I have the same one.

102
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,037
We gotta watch Back to the Future II.

103
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,554
I'll make the popcorn.

104
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,028
-So where should we go first?
-Ooh.

105
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,315
-There's a cover band in the lounge.
-Nah.

106
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:07,435
-But they play Barry Manilow.
-No.

107
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:10,193
But they're called Fairly Manilow.

108
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:13,112
-Oh, okay.
-6 reat.

109
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,951


110
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:17,754
-Well, what do you wanna do?
-Well, we're in Vegas.

111
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,194
I wanna go downstairs,
get a bucket of margaritas...

112
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:22,589
...dance until I vomit
all over a roulette wheel...

113
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,194
...and watch it go everywhere.

114
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:27,315
-What if we don't wanna vomit?
-Oh, you will.

115
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,277
That's why they give you the bucket.

116
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:33,518
-Uh-oh. It's my boss.
-What?

117
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,717
-They moved my field ride up to Monday.
-What does that mean?

118
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,917
It means instead of having a week to study,
I only have two days.

119
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:42,547
-That sucks.
-Can you start in the morning?

120
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,789
It's kind of a lot. Let me do a little tonight
and I'll catch up with you later.

121
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,915
-You sure?
-Yeah, it's okay. Go ahead.

122
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:55,278
-So, uh, now that Penny's not coming--
-We're not seeing Fairly Manilow.

123
00:06:57,679 --> 00:07:00,273
[BACK TO THE FUTURE THEME MUSIC
PLAYING OVER TV]

124
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,994
Okay, wait. Hold on. Pause.

125
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,912
Something doesn't make sense. Look.

126
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,556
In 2015, Biff steals the sports almanac...

127
00:07:10,719 --> 00:07:15,429
...and takes the time machine back to 1955
to give it to his younger self.

128
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,796
But as soon as he does that,
he changes the future...

129
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:22,634
...so the 2015 he returns to
would be a different 2015...

130
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:24,949
...not the 2015 that Marty and Doc were in.

131
00:07:25,119 --> 00:07:27,633
This is Hot Tub Time Machine
all over again.

132
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,438
If future Biff goes back to 2015...

133
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,716
...right after he gives
young Biff the almanac...

134
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,678
...he could get back to the 2015
with Marty and Doc in it.

135
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:44,028
Because it wasn't until his 21st birthday
that 1955 Biff placed his first bet.

136
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,555
-Whoa. ls "placed" right?
-What do you mean?

137
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,757
ls "placed" the right tense
for something that would have happened...

138
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,673
...in the future of a past that was affected
by something from the future?

139
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:57,474
"Had will have placed"?

140
00:07:57,999 --> 00:07:59,751
That's my boy.

141
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:04,317
Okay, so it wasn't until his 21st birthday...

142
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,756
...that Biff "had will have placed"
his first bet and made his millions.

143
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,149
That's when he altered the timeline.

144
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,595
Yeah, but he had will haven't placed it.

145
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,038
What?

146
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,988
Unlike Hot Tub Time Machine,
this couldn't be more simple.

147
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,869
When Biff gets the almanac in 1955,
the alternate future he creates...

148
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,031
...isn't the one in which
Marty and Doc Brown...

149
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,236
...ever use the time machine
to travel to 2015.

150
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:33,592
Therefore, in the new timeline,
Marty and Doc never brought the time ma--

151
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:35,875
Wait, is "brought" right?

152
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:43,914
Marty and Doc never
"had have had brought"?

153
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,072
I don't know, you did it to me.

154
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:49,993
Yeah. I'm going with it.

155
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:54,118
Marty and Doc never "had have had"
brought the time machine to 2015.

156
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:56,156
That means 2015 Biff...

157
00:08:56,319 --> 00:09:00,790
...could also not "had have had"
brought the almanac to 1955 Biff.

158
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,238
Therefore, the timeline in which 1955 Biff
gets the almanac...

159
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,473
...is also the timeline in which 1955 Biff
never gets the almanac.

160
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:10,867
And notjust never gets.

161
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,828
Never have, never hasn't,
never had have hasn't.

162
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,957
He's right.

163
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,428
Also, what kind of name is Biff?
