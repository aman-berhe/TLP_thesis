-Yeah. It's all very professional.

exciting time in the history of the field.

I started doing it.

You know the government funded
the biggest experiment yet...

...to detect dark matter?

15
00:00:41,319 --> 00:00:44,914
I read about that. They're sending research
teams down into abandoned salt mines.

Look. Sheldon, if we apply
to be one of those teams...

of something big.

-Why not?

You had a panic attack
when we went through the car wash.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,596
Perhaps the emotion you're referring to
was shock at you having something cleaned.

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,310
I think what Penny meant is the thought
of you two in a mine is funny.

24

34
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,677
It was only for PlayStation 2...

35
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,156
...but then they came out with a new version
for P53 with better graphics.

36
00:02:08,359 --> 00:02:12,637
I finally got a chance to play it, and for some
reason, it just wasn't as good as the first one.

-Let's see.

165
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,875
Seven-hundred and four--?
No. Wait. it's on "clock."

166
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,308
Uh, the real answer isn't much better,
102 degrees.

167
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,399
That's what we wanted.
This is as hot as the mines will be.

168
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,999
True.

169
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,478
Sheldon's mine-simulation log. Entry one.

170
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,117
Koothrappali's restating of the obvious
is already getting on my nerves.

171
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,076
-Thanks again for having us.
-Of course.

172
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,792
What did you wanna talk about?

173
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:12,751
Well, now that we're engaged...

174
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,071
...we had questions about
how you handle money as a couple.

175
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:19,233
I told you they weren't gonna
ask us to swing with them.

176
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,238
I didn't think they were going to.

177
00:10:23,439 --> 00:10:26,795
I just wanted to have a way to say no
without hurting Leonard's feelings.

178
00:10:27,439 --> 00:10:30,033
Well, nailed it.

179
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,468
What did you wanna know?

180
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:34,313
Well, do you guys ever fight over money?

181
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:35,793
Sure. Sometimes.

182
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:39,275
It can be a little awkward since
I make so much more money than Howie.

183
00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:43,349
You didn't have to say, "So much more."
Heh.

184
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,717
I didn't have to, but for the sake of accuracy,
I felt that I should.

185
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,474
I brought significant assets
into the relationship too.

186
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,639
Like what? Your incomplete set
of Star Trek collector plates?

187
00:10:55,999 --> 00:10:58,957
For your information,
ljust bought the last one I needed on eBay.

188
00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:00,872
Without asking me?

189
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,315
There were only three minutes
left in the auction.

190
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:07,795
It was a mint-condition
"Scotty" from a smoke-free home.

191
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:11,951
-How much, Howie?
-Not a lot.

192
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:13,831
How much?

193
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,914
Let's not talk about this
in front of our friends.

194
00:11:17,439 --> 00:11:20,078
Was it more or less than falconry school?

195
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,149
For the 10th time, that was a Groupon.

196
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:29,037
Like I would swing with him.

197
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:35,478
How you feeling?

198
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:36,668
Good.

199
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,437
A little claustrophobic.

200
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:43,188
Let's set up the equipment.
It'll help take your mind off of it.

201
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,870
Miners often sing mining songs
to keep their spirits up.

202
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:50,355
-Do you know any mining songs?
-Just the hits.

203
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:56,475
[SINGING] Where it's dark as a dungeon
And as damp as the dew

204
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,669
That's pretty.

205
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:03,000
Where the dangers are double
And the pleasures are few

206
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:07,954
Where the rain never falls
And the sun never shines

207
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,756
Yes, it's dark as a dungeon
Way down in the mines

208
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,030
It's a little more bleak than I thought.

209
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,875
Well, [play when I'm dead
And the ages shall roll

210
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,755
That my body will blacken
And turn into coal

211
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,473
We're getting kind of grim.

212
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,510
Then I'll look from the door
Of my heavenly home

213
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,152
And pity the miner
That mines my poor bones

214
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,390
Okay. How about a little Miley Cyrus next?

215
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,992
Who's he?

216
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:54,433
Talk about wasted money,
what about the late fees on our credit card...

217
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,358
-...because somebody didn't pay on time?
-I would've paid it...

218
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,670
...if I wasn't doing everything else
around here.

219
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,354
You're saying
I don't do anything around here?

220
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:06,430
Look at my chore chart.

221
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,874
-She made him a chore--
-| see it.

222
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:13,431
"Do the dishes."
There's a star right there.

223
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:16,358
That was a pity star.
Putting water in the roasting pan...

224
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,120
...and leaving it in the sink
is not doing the dishes.

225
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,076
That pan had to soak, and you know it.

226
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,279
Don't come crying to me
when you don't get your allowance.

227
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,791
It's not an allowance. It's a stipend.

228
00:13:29,999 --> 00:13:34,117
And we said we weren't gonna
call it an allowance in front of my friends.

229
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,708
[DOOR SLAMS]

230
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,799
I usually don't like lemon bars,
but these are really good.

231
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:46,952
So as Hannah Montana...

232
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,354
...Miley was a world-famous pop star.

233
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,273
She would take off her wig
and go to school like a normal girl.

234
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,109
Which, I don't have to tell you,
at that age, is its own headache.

235
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,433
That's preposterous. How would she go
unrecognized just by wearing a wig?

236
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:04,711
But you're okay with Superman
concealing his identity with glasses?

237
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:06,756
He doesn'tjust put on a pair of glasses.

238
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:10,953
He combs back his curlicue
and affects a mild-mannered personality.

239
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,718
AMY:
You guys doing okay down there?

240
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,229
I told you to use the walkie-talkie.

241
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:20,348
AMY [OVER RADIO]:
You guys doing okay down there?

242
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,950
Please keep this channel clear
for emergencies. Thank you.

243
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:28,473
I'm going to the vending machine.
Do you want anything?

244
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,555
This is a simulation. We have to survive
on the supplies we brought.

245
00:14:32,719 --> 00:14:34,994
Okay. Just checking.

246
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,554
We should have asked her
to get some Funyuns.

247
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,711
You're not going to have Funyuns
when we're a mile below the Earth.

248
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,956
What if we brought them down with us?

249
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:46,797
We'll take some Funyuns.

250
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,392
Anything else?

251
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,398
Some York Peppermint Patties,
a couple of Dr Peppers...

252
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,672
...and run to Best Buy and see if
they have a portable DVD player...

253
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,952
...and season one of a show
called Hannah Montana.

254
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,879
Have her get season two.
Season one it was still finding itself.

255
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,430
Sorry you guys had to see that.

256
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:09,789
-Don't apologize.
-It makes it harder...

257
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,991
...to pretend it never happened.

258
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,835
Money's a sensitive subject for Howie
because of the difference in our income.

259
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,075
It really bothers him?

260
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,077
Sure. There's still a lot of pressure
on guys to be providers.

261
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:23,191
So even though he's happy for me,
it's just a little tough on him.

262
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,349
Uh-oh.

263
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:25,952
-What?
-We||...

264
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,878
...ifl do well in sales, I could end up
making more than you.

265
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:31,035
Not a problem. I grew up with a mother...

266
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:35,238
...who emasculated my father financially
and in every other aspect of his life.

267
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,793
Really, it's what I think love looks like.

268
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:43,109
I'll be right back.
I'm gonna go check on him.

269
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,555
Maybe it's a good thing we came here.
It's like a lesson in what not to do.

270
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:50,909
I don't want money to come between us.

271
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,396
It won't. Let's promise to figure
this stuff out before we get married.

272
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:58,235
HOWARD: Why are you being so bossy?
BERNADETTE: Why are you being a baby?

273
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:04,112
HOWARD: I'm not a baby. I'm a grown man,
and I made the bed. Now where's my star?

274
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,718
-Should we go?
-Hang on. I wanna see if he gets the star.

275
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,831
This heat is brutal.

276
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:18,428
As someone from the
tropical subcontinent of India...

277
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,028
...you should know fanning yourself
in a humid environment...

278
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,030
...raises your body temperature.

279
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,794
Huh. That does explain why the servants
used to look so hot...

280
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:27,597
...while they were fanning me.

281
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:31,154
Let's get our minds off
how uncomfortable we are.

282
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,794
We could take some more
simulated instrument readings.

283
00:16:33,999 --> 00:16:37,230
My major focus at the moment
is keeping my claustrophobia at bay.

284
00:16:37,439 --> 00:16:39,430
-How's that going?
-You tell me.

285
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:43,109
I feel like I can't breathe,
and I am tempted to crack you open...

286
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:45,753
...and suck the air right out of your lungs.

287
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,430
Sheldon, if this is too much, we can stop.

288
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:52,153
-We're not stopping.
-You don't have to bite my head off.

289
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,153
I apologize. ljust--

290
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,828
I'm plagued by an internal struggle.

291
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,749
If you would just use the bucket,
you'd be so much more comfortable.

292
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,751
My struggle is emotional.

293
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,552
-Is it Amy?
-lt's dark matter.

294
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,349
When I entered the field of string theory,
I was a prodigy.

295
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,910
l rose to a position of respect...

296
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,159
...and I assumed my career would
continue on that upward trajectory.

297
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,236
Now here I am in my 30s.

298
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:26,828
I'm back at square one.

299
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,991
And frankly, it's frightening.

300
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:34,472
Sheldon, you know what
I think of when I'm scared?

301
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,471
Voyager.

302
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,430
Voyager the space probe,
or Voyager the Star Trek TV show?

303
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,877
-The space probe.
-Good.

304
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,436
I am too hot and tired to go on about
how much I hate Voyagerthe TV show.

305
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,989
By the time I was born, Voyager 1's
mission was supposed to be over.

306
00:17:53,199 --> 00:17:56,828
It had seen Jupiter
and Saturn and all their moons...

307
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,950
...but it kept going.

308
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,393
When I left India for America,
I was never more scared in my life.

309
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:06,670
I had no idea what lay ahead.

310
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,274
Whenever I feel that way,
I think about how Voyager is...

311
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,152
...still out there.

312
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,476
Somewhere beyond our solar system.

313
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,147
Going further than anyone
ever thought it could.

314
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:23,955
Don't leave. You can do this.

315
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:27,787
Sheldon, is everything okay?

316
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,150
It's too late for Koothrappali. Let's go.

317
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,194
Eleven minutes.
That's longer than I thought.

318
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,558
RAJ: They're in my shirt.
They're in my shirt. They're in my shirt!

319
00:18:45,439 --> 00:18:48,476
Okay, this is definitely the most fun thing
we can do with the money.

320
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,114
I've never done it on
a big old pile of cash before.

321
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,438
"Me neither, Leonard.
It's my first time too."

322
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,234
I'm so sorry I made you
feel bad about the money stuff.

323
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,034
-lt's okay.
-No. It's not okay.

324
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,549
I want us to be partners. Equals.

325
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,955
Adults in a mature relationship.

326
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:18,229
I want that too.
