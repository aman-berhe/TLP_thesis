1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,116
-What are you working on these days?
-l'm studying one-celled organisms...

2
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:10,197
...to find the neurochemicals
that lead to the feeling of shame.

3
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:13,478
What do one-celled organisms have
to be embarrassed about?

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,592
Same as all of us,
getting out of a car without underwear.

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,157
Speaking of underwear,
l have some interesting news.

6
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,113
If it's sometimes Howie wears yours,
Leonard already told us.

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,151
He was being funny.

8
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:29,872
I'm pretty sure.

9
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,397
Anyway, I was asked
to be a part of a magazine article...

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,593
...about the 50 sexiest female scientists
in California. Isn't that cool?

11
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:40,073
lthink it's awful.

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,429
Why would you say that?

13
00:00:41,639 --> 00:00:44,153
Bernadette is a successful
microbiologist.

14
00:00:44,319 --> 00:00:46,992
She should be celebrated
for her achievements, not her looks.

15
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:49,593
-What kind of message does that send?
-The message is:

16
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,029
"Check out the rack on that scientist."

17
00:00:53,919 --> 00:00:57,389
Why can't someone be thought of
as both smart and pretty?

18
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,757
I don't think a professional woman
should have to flaunt her sexuality...

19
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,433
-...in order to get ahead.
PENNY: Okay.

20
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,388
What's the big deal? If it helps me
make a sale, I don't think it hurts to flirt.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,911
Laugh at theirjoke, touch their arm...

22
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,350
...maybe crank up the a.c.
in the car beforehand...

23
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,795
...you know, to wake up the girls.

24
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,231
Maybe it's different in the world of sales...

25
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,750
...but it's already hard enough for women
to be taken seriously in science.

26
00:01:21,399 --> 00:01:24,835
l was kind of excited about the article,
but now you're making me feel bad.

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,718
I think you should do whatever you want.

28
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,474
Maybe if fashion magazines
had female scientists in them...

29
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,631
...I would've become
a theoretical physicist.

30
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,837
Stop smirking at each other.

31
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:12,032
-Thank you.
-Oh, no. Thank you.

32
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,119
Delivery men are the unsung foot soldiers
of our nation's commerce.

33
00:02:17,359 --> 00:02:21,910
It's because of people like you
people like me can limit our human contact.

34
00:02:22,679 --> 00:02:26,228
I'd shake your hand, but, well, you know....

35
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,115
I'm not a delivery man, I'm a doctor.

36
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:34,110
Although I do often deliver
alarming biopsy results to my patients.

37
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,031
That's humorous.

38
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,678
All right.

39
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,914
Yeah, I bet you leave your patients
in stitches.

40
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,435
That was also humorous.

41
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,238
DOCTOR:
All right.

42
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,916
Are you bringing flowers to a patient...

43
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,509
...to cushion the blow
of a terminal diagnosis?

44
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,591
[LAUGHS]

45
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:07,350
That wasn't ajoke.

46
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:09,312
All right.

47
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,396
These are actually for a nice woman
who makes sales calls to my office.

48
00:03:14,559 --> 00:03:15,833
SHELDON:
Hmm.

49
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:19,670
You know, they have delivery people
that will do that for you.

50
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,751
Yeah, I was hoping to impress her
by tracking her down on the Internet...

51
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,394
...and then showing up unannounced
at her door.

52
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,192
Making the extra effort. Good for you.

53
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:43,387
-Great timing. Food just got here.
-Oh, Siam Palace?

54
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:45,436
-Yes.
-Mee krob and chicken satay?

55
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,033
-Yes.
-Extra peanut sauce?

56
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,078
-No, but you can have mine.
-Ah, uh, very well.

57
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,234
Oh, and on the topic
of sharing things that are yours...

58
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,268
...there is a gentleman caller bringing
flowers to your fiancée as we speak.

59
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,799
What?

60
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,515
Why didn't you say that first?

61
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,553
Why didn't you get extra peanut sauce?

62
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,116
We can both play this game.

63
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,912
Can I help you?

64
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,076
Oh, hi. Uh, does Penny live here?

65
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:15,118
May I ask why?

66
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,676
Well, uh, I met her at my office.
She winked at me, and, uh...

67
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,276
...l-- I came hoping
to initiate a romantic relationship.

68
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,027
Um....

69
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:32,508
Look, I'm pretty sure
she didn't wink at you.

70
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,199
Oh, she did, heh.

71
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:37,913
Seductively, like this:

72
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:43,557
And then she touched my arm
for two Mississippis. Like, you know...

73
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,398
-...one Mississippi, two Mississippi--
-I got it, I got it.

74
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,270
Listen, uh, I think
there's been a misunderstanding.

75
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,277
See, Penny is my fiancée.

76
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,359
Really?

77
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,116
I've never seen her wear
an engagement ring.

78
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:02,793
BOTH:
Really?

79
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:11,597
So am I to presume that her flirtation
was just a sales technique?

80
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,349
lthink so.

81
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,876
When will I learn?

82
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,109
It's just like the cute girl
at the pet store all over again.

83
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:21,948
Excuse me?

84
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:25,712
Oh, uh, she touched my arm
for five Mississippis...

85
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,593
...and I bought a $2000 iguana habitat.

86
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,470
Which she was always too busy
to come over and see.

87
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,549
You give these to Penny.

88
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:40,188
You're a lucky man.

89
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,989
Thank you. Sorry.

90
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:47,350
Oh, um. you probably
don't want her to see this.

91
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,516
It's unnecessarily graphic.

92
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,391
Hold on, doctor.
Leonard, where are your social skills?

93
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,991
This man is clearly upset.

94
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,793
We should invite him in
for a hot beverage.

95
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,158
He tried to score with Penny.

96
00:06:05,359 --> 00:06:08,431
So have these two,
and they're having dinner with us.

97
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,836
So how was work today?

98
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,749
It was fine. But you'll be happy to know
they pulled the sexy-scientist article.

99
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,469
What happened?

100
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:25,188
I don't know. Theyjust canceled the
photo shoot and said they're rethinking it.

101
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,394
I'm really sorry...

102
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,519
...but I think it's for the best.

103
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,756
You want people focusing
on your achievements...

104
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,035
...not staring at your breasts
in some magazine.

105
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,548
I guess. It's really not that important.

106
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:40,029
Hey. Up here.

107
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,714
Sorry, we were just--
We were talking about them.

108
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,313
So....

109
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,953
I wasn't gonna say anything...

110
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,799
...but since you seem to be okay
with the article being canceled...

111
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,358
...l have a little confession.

112
00:06:53,559 --> 00:06:54,833
I'm the reason it was pulled.

113
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:56,672
What? How?

114
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,350
I sent the editors of the magazine
a pretty scathing e-mail.

115
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:01,912
Amy, what did you say?

116
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:03,234
I simply pointed out...

117
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:07,512
...that they'd never consider doing an article
ranking male scientists on their sexuality...

118
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:10,477
...let alone showing them
in various stages of undress.

119
00:07:10,679 --> 00:07:13,318
Because no one wants to see
Neil deGrasse Tyson in a wet T-shirt...

120
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,789
...bent over the hood of a Porsche.

121
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,429
It doesn't make a difference,
because they agreed it was in bad taste...

122
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:23,516
...and now you agree, so, heh...

123
00:07:23,719 --> 00:07:25,869
...Amy saves the day.

124
00:07:26,799 --> 00:07:28,551
No, what happened was you gotjealous...

125
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,075
...so you took away a chance
for me to get publicity.

126
00:07:31,239 --> 00:07:32,877
But it was bad publicity.

127
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,876
That's for me to decide, not you.

128
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,353
I disagree.

129
00:07:36,559 --> 00:07:40,438
As a female scientist,
I think what you do affects all of us.

130
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,909
I think you don't like
people expressing their sexuality...

131
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,674
...because no one wants you
to express yours.

132
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,634
Oh, Amy, I'm so sorry.
That was over the line.

133
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:51,714
You have a nice night.

134
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:55,908
Please don't go. Up until my vicious attack,
you were the one in the wrong.

135
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,073
Here you go, doctor.

136
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,715
-A Red Zinger with one teaspoon of honey.
DOCTOR: Thank you.

137
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:06,511
Neat Star Trek mug.

138
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:09,438
I actually have one of the phasers
from the original TV show.

139
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:12,115
-Cool.
-How'd you get that?

140
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,312
Easy. Gene Roddenberry
needed a vasectomy.

141
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,919
Wait a minute. You've snipped
Gene Roddenberry's vas deferens?

142
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:22,628
Yes.

143
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,872
Wow, you really went
where no man has gone before.

144
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,794
I don't like to brag,
but, uh, you see, I'm kind of...

145
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:36,435
...the doctor to the stars' urinary tracts.

146
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,552
ALL:
Wow.

147
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,270
You wanna see
James Cameron's kidney stone?

148
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:49,517
ALL:
Ooh!

149
00:08:50,439 --> 00:08:53,795
He was so happy after he passed it,
he gave me a Terminator.

150
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:57,393
That is amazing.
How long have you been collecting?

151
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,553
Well, ever since I was a kid,
but, uh, I didn't really get serious...

152
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,676
...until William Shatner's
bladder infection.

153
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:06,711
What'd you get? What'd you get?

154
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,639
Well, he said it was a tribble.

155
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,832
It could be a toupee,
but either way, it's pretty cool.

156
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,436
I would love to see your collection.

157
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:18,233
Anytime. I've got some cool stuff.

158
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,230
When I first started, I thought
it'd be a good way to meet women...

159
00:09:22,439 --> 00:09:24,475
...but, well, you know, heh.

160
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:27,034
-We know.
-Preach.

161
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,115
Could I ask you a personal question?

162
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,435
-Sure.
-Um....

163
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,478
I mean, you're a guy like me...

164
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,399
...so how'd you get a girl like Penny?

165
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,149
Oh.

166
00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:44,949
Well, you know,just being myself, really.

167
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,754
Oh, please! I'll tell you how he did it.

168
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,155
lmplacable, relentless badgering.

169
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:55,991
In urology terms,
he was a drug-resistant staph infection...

170
00:09:56,199 --> 00:09:59,509
...and she was a urethra

-Hi.
-Well, that didn't go your way.

Dr. Lorvis, what are you doing here?

176
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,840
Um, well, actually, I came to see you.

177
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,189
Really? Why?

178
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,755
That's a good question.

179
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:29,795
Apparently,
someone was being awfully flirty...

180
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:32,837
...while not wearing their engagement ring,
causing someone to show up...

181
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,990
...thinking the first someone
might be available.

182
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,631
Oh, God, don't make it so hard on her.
The first someone is the deceitful you.

183
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:44,470
The second someone
is the delightful Dr. Lorvis.

184
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,318
Oh, this is very embarrassing.

185
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,876
Dr. Lorvis, I am so sorry,
I did not mean to lead you on.

186
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,152
You touched my arm
for two Mississippis.

187
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:57,319
That's why you were mumbling
"Mississippi."

188
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,110
-Can we talk in private?
-Please, yes.

189
00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:01,877
I'll be right back.

190
00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:07,478
So, what other celebrity genitalia
have you handled?

191
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,236
So, what's the deal? You take off your ring
when you go to work?

192
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:14,999
What? No, no.
I just put it on the other hand...

193
00:11:15,199 --> 00:11:18,032
...and turn it around.

194
00:11:18,239 --> 00:11:20,195

195
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,469
Why?

196
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,797
What do you mean "why?" I make
more sales if doctors think I'm single.

197
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,359
I did the same as a waitress.

198
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,080
The real question is,
what is he doing in your apartment?

199
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,717
He was upset, so Sheldon invited him in
for a hot beverage.

200
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,275
-You were okay with that?
-No, I got upset.

201
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,914
Sheldon made me a beverage too.

202
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,271
He just showed up at my door.
Don't you think that's a little weird?

203
00:11:42,439 --> 00:11:44,714
A little, but he's basically harmless.

204
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,638
He's actually kind of a nice guy.

205
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,957
My company doesn't allow me
to socialize with doctors outside of work.

206
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:53,270
-You gotta get rid of him.
-Why am I the one that has to get rid of him?

207
00:11:53,439 --> 00:11:55,316
I can't do it. He's my best client.
