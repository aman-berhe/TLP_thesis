00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,593
Oh, hey. We ran into your mum
at Benihana last night.

2
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:08,158
Oh. Yeah. She loves that place.

3
00:00:08,319 --> 00:00:12,392
Every time they flip a shrimp in the air,
she practically leaps out of her seat to catch it.

4
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,550
It's why I don't take her to SeaWorld.

5
00:00:16,479 --> 00:00:19,312
I know you don't want to hear it,
but she was there with Stuart.

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,758
That's fine, I don't care.

7
00:00:21,919 --> 00:00:23,716
Doesn't bug you when they go on dates?

8
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:27,758
They're not dating. They're just two friends
who went out to dinner.

9
00:00:27,919 --> 00:00:30,308
Then went back home
where they probably fell asleep...

10
00:00:30,479 --> 00:00:34,711
...in the matching pajamas she got them
because they both just love penguins.

11
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,709
Hey, lots of people wear matching pajamas
who aren't dating.

12
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,394
-Like who?
-Like you and your dog.

13
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,595
Don't rule out the dating.

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,195
-Fine, it bothers me. You happy?
-You think you've got problems.

15
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:58,230
The gibbon is the only member
of the ape family not classified as a great ape.

16
00:00:59,839 --> 00:01:00,828
How is this helpful?

17
00:01:00,999 --> 00:01:04,833
All the non-human apes
are classified as great apes, except one.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,834
That means taxonomists
created the entire category of lesser ape...

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,391
...just to single out the poor gibbon
as the weird kid on the playground.

20
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,348
Now, there's a hairy little fella
with a genuine beef.

21
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,829
But the gibbon doesn't know
what it's categorized as.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,470
-It doesn't even know it's called a gibbon.
-True.

23
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,995
Sorry, kid. You got it worse than a gibbon.

24
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,995
-Hi.
-Hey.

25
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,673
We brought snacks for movie night.

26
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,035
Great. I don't suppose
you also brought napkins...

27
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,555
...clean bowls,
utensils and a roll of toilet paper?

28
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,675
-Right here.
-Ah!

29
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,914
-You guys are the best.
-What's with the clothes?

30
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,310
With all the new stuff I bought for work,
I needed room in my closet.

31
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,358
I meant why are they folded. But whatever.

32
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,240
-Ooh. What's this?
-That, believe it or not, is my prom dress.

33
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,277
Wow, you still have it?

34
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:24,591
ljust assumed it was hailed up
in the corner of a barn somewhere.

35
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:29,790
What kind of teenager did you think I was?

36
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,598
-Slutty.
-Easy.

37
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,634
The word is "popular."

38
00:02:36,999 --> 00:02:40,071
-How was your prom? Did you go?
-No, but I was on cleanup crew.

39
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,993
-Aw. That's sad.
-No, it was okay.

40
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:47,152
The DJ let me dance one slow song
with my mop before he shut down.

41
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,791
Whenever I see a bucket of dirty water,
I still hear "Lady in Red."

42
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:57,557
My prom was pretty terrible too.

43
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,554
l was excited about my date, but turned out
he only asked me because he liked my friend.

44
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:05,553
-He spent the whole night talking about her.
-We get it, you had a friend and a date.

45
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,472
Stop bragging.

46
00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:10,873
-It doesn't matter. Prom is silly anyway.
-Easy for you to say.

47

of the football team.

00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,912
Uh, no.

49
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,470
ljust made out with him a little
while his date was puking. Heh.

50
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,509
My date would've had to clean that up.

51
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,269
l have an idea.
Maybe we can have, like, a prom do-over.

52
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,953
That would be so much fun.

53
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,918
We could decorate the roof
and make the guys wear tuxedoes.

54
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,672
Get our hair done and slow dance.

55
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,400

who's been to seven proms...

two "Enchanted Evenings"...

...and one "Night to Remember"
that I cannot remember for the life of me.

-Hey. Where's Bernadette?

61
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,395

for their prom thing.

Ever since I saw Pretty in Pink,
I've wanted to go to an American prom.

64
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,070
But then I saw Carrie
and I did not wanna go to an American prom.

65
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,556
But then I saw Never Been Kissed
and I'm back on the prom bandwagon.

66
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,674
This prom thing
has been a real roller coaster.

67

Bernie's really excited.

68
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,830
I mean, I could tell, because her voice got
so high the beagle next door started howling.

69
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:26,348
-Did you go to your prom?
-No. Heh.

70
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,954
I had a date with a proper education.

71
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,193
Instead of a tuxedo,
l dressed myself in good habits.

72
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:38,637
Instead of spiked punch,
I enjoyed the intoxicating flavor of knowledge.

73
00:04:38,799 --> 00:04:42,030
Instead of dancing in a gym,
I shook my booty to the seductive rhythms--

74

00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,628
To be honest, it's kind of a dream come true
to go to even a fake prom...

You know exactly who it is.
He's gonna bring my mom.

Why did you even invite him?

91
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:36,873
Because he's our friend
and you two need to get along.

92
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,475
Why can't he take your mom?
You took her to your prom.

93
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,717
I didn't take her. She was a chaperone.

94
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:47,677
