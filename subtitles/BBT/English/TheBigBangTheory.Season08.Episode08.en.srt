Welcome to The Big Bang Theory
writers panel, everyone.

43
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,518
Just a couple of business notes.

44
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,674
Writers are in essence, um,
shy and retiring creatures.

45
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,434
Nerdy, if you will forgive the word.

46
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:39,716
And writers on The Big Bang Theory...

47
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:44,475
...are the most extreme example of that
the world has ever seen.

53
00:03:03,279 --> 00:03:06,237
And it's my belief that they only
have a science consultant...

54
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,398

before we begin.

Uh, really pretty much to anyone
who cares to answer.

Well, The Big Bang Theory at the time...

62
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,391
...had been nominated for three Emmy
Awards, and hadn't won any.

63
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,315
And Bob Newhart came on the show
one time and got one.

64
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,679

"We have to kill this guy."

Yeah, he's, uh.... There's really
no death in sitcoms, yeah.

he was gonna die? I mean....

00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,310
Uh, well, Chuck Lorre and I called him
on the phone.

71
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,871
And I think it started off with Chuck saying,
"Hey, Bob, so good news, bad news.

72
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:21,837
We want you back on the show,
but we want you to die."

73
00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:26,590
And, uh, I asked him,
"Are you familiar with Star Wars?"

74
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:31,389
And he said, "No,"
because he's Bob Newhart.

75
00:04:31,559 --> 00:04:34,232
FERGUSON: That's the fastest
I've ever heard him speak, right there.

76
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,119
So I had to give him like athree-minute
crash-course on Star Wars...

77
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,431
...and Luke and Obi-Wan, and then once
he understood what we were trying to do...

78
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,392
...he was actually very into it
and very excited.

79
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,757
FERGUSON: How did you manage
to get James Earl Jones--

80
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:51,232
Who was in Star Wars, after all,
and is probably quite proud of it.

81
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,834
--on the show? Was he an easy get?

82
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:57,349
When we approached him, uh,
he was very excited to do it.

83
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:01,432
And he was as delightful to work with
as he was on the show.

84
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:04,671

we also managed to get Carrie Fisher.

86
00:05:06,679 --> 00:05:10,638
...was James Earl Jones did the voice of
Darth Vader, but he was never on the set...

87
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:13,472

was the first day...

and Carrie Fisher ever met in person.

but there's been such an array of people.

to have gotten on?

Well, uh, are you one
of the more recent members of the--?

103

-Craig. Uh, yeah, I've been on the show....

105

by how long we've been on the show.

to walk into a show like this...

109
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:23,317

and they have their ways?

110
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:25,435
-Do we look intimidating?
-And then you walk in...

Yes, there's a lot of, uh....

114
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,198
It's intimidating.
I mean, writing is hard and difficult.

115
00:06:36,359 --> 00:06:39,431
But, you know, you walk into a room
where, like you said...

116
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:43,353
...we get to talk about Star Wars,
and we play D&D together, and--

117
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:46,591
I think it's also important to remember
that when this show began--

118
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:49,910
And it's easy to forget this,
but when the show began...

119
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,310
...this kind of thing was not as popular.

120
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,757
It wasn't like the networks were saying,
"Let's make a show about geeks and nerds."

121
00:06:56,919 --> 00:06:59,513
I mean, when it started,
there was a lot of scoffing within CBS.

122
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,679
There was a lot of kind of, "Yeah, that'll work.
Yeah, yeah, Chuck's finally lost his mind."

123
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,592
You know, and it was--

124
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,833
But, you know, we never set out
to do a show about geeks or nerds.

125
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,675
You know, we were making a show
about people we knew.

126
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:19,471
And, you know, the basis for the--
The original basis for the characters...

127
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:23,188
...was guys that I knew
when I had been a computer programmer.

128
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,510
And I started talking to Chuck
about those guys.

129
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:28,512
And then we changed it.
We didn't want them to be programmers...

130
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,757
...because that had over the years
become like the Microsoft money thing...

131
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,477
...and we didn't want it to be that.

132
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,519
But it was still, you know, just based
on people we knew and stuff we like.

133
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,240
What about the point of,
you get to a situation now...

134
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,914
...where you have a cast
which is very well established...

135
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:47,516
...and they know their characters very well,
and hopefully everything's going to be fine.

136
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,310
And, um, do they have--?
Do you now consult--?

137
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:56,148
At this point in the life of a sitcom,
do you actually talk to the actors...

138
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,868
...about how things will go,
and do you take their input?

139
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:02,155
-Yeah, we do talk to them.
-Yeah?

140
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,391
I get excited about the stories we're doing,
and I'll often tell them:

141
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,109
"Hey, this is coming up."
And, uh, Johnny Galecki has told me...

142
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:14,029
...that he actually enjoys that
and finds that helpful, because he knows--

143
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:17,316
You know, sometimes it's just words
on a page and it's not readily apparent...

144
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,310
...the tone or the mood we're going for,
so it's very helpful for us to talk about it.

145
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,518
Are you encouraging of young people?
Well, let me ask them. Uh....

146
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,156
-Hi.
-Is it an easy place to work your way into?

147
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,313
Because it's not a huge writers room, really,
I mean, if this is all of you guys, it's not huge.

148
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:39,553
l was a writers' assistant for two years,
so I eased my way into it.

149
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:44,714
And ljust got some jokes on TV
and they promoted me and it, uh....

150
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,831
That's howl eased into it, so....

151
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:50,708
And I was a fan of the show,
so I was familiar with the characters.

152
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:54,554
And then I worked on the show,
like Jeremy, as an assistant...

153
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,315
...for a couple seasons
before I got moved up.

154
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,870
Let's work our way up to the more
seasoned writers as we go along.

155
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,112
So, uh, what was your experience like
coming in?

156
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,313
It was great. I had worked with Steven Molaro
and Steve Holland before at Nickelodeon.

157
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,313
So I had an easy transition
as far as that goes.

158
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:18,316
How about you? How long into the show
before you interviewed and got the job?

159
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,153
-l was on season three.
-Okay, so that's quite early.

160
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,799
There is a weirdness with the actors.

161
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,349
You've been watching the show,
experiencing these characters.

162
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,397
You spend all yourtime imagining
these characters. Then you meet them...

163
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:31,915
...and they look like somebody you think
about all day long, but you don't know them.

164
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,957
-Like, it's weird, it's awkward.
-Yeah, it is.

165
00:09:34,119 --> 00:09:38,715
You wanna be like, "What would you do in
this situation? I can't think of it. Tell me."

166
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,559
That's kind of handy. And next?

167
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:46,397
-Same. The three of us joined season three.
-All right, okay.

168
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:49,278
So the show hadn't quite taken off.
It sort of really took off--

169
00:09:49,439 --> 00:09:52,590
I'm not saying there's a correlation
between when we joined and--

170
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,319
I'll leave that to you guys,
and you make your own call...

171
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:00,793
-...on what you think about that, but....
-And, uh, yes?

172
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,758
Oh, no. I mean, yeah, it wasjust....

173
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,559
Every different show you go on
has a different language...

174
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,315
...and it takes a little while to kind of learn
the language of that show...

175
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,040
...and the dynamic, and find your place in it.

176
00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:16,316
But I was very fortunate to come on board
when these guys did.

177
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,508
So I didn't-- We could get together
at the end of the day and, uh, cry.

178
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,190
We would rotate offices,
whose office we would cry in, just like:

179
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,718
"Oh, my God, I feel like I'm failing."
"So do I." "Oh, good, I'm not alone."

180
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:32,870
-You're great.
-Thanks. This is really therapeutic.

181
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,951
Thank you all. Heh-heh.

182
00:10:35,119 --> 00:10:39,112
And Dave and Eric, you guys have been on
since the beginning, is that right?

183
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:42,113
-No, Dave has been on since the beginning.
-Right.

184
00:10:42,319 --> 00:10:44,674
-I joined at the beginning of season two.
-Season two.

185
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:51,393
MOLARO: Eric, didn't you get your interview
because they got the wrong Eric Kaplan?

186
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,551
-Yes, yes.
-This is true.

187
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:56,028
FERGUSON: There cannot be two.
-A different Eric Kaplan...

188
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,792
...was supposed to come
for a meeting...

189
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:01,031
...and somehow wires got crossed
and this Eric showed up.

190
00:11:01,199 --> 00:11:04,794
Johnny wanted Eric Kaplan
the gaucho from Patagonia...

191
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,076
...with one of those bolas
that he would swing.

192
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,313
And then I think Jess Ambrosetti was like,
"Well, he's a gaucho.

193
00:11:11,479 --> 00:11:15,108
This other Eric Kaplan worked for Futurama."
So she made the executive decision...

194
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,558
-...to send my résumé to Bill Prady here.
-That worked out.

195
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:25,397
We'd met in New York a long time ago when
you worked-- Eric wrote for Spy magazine...

196
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:30,508
...which was, um, I think, sort of the heir,
in a way, to Mad Magazine.

197
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,075
Yeah, it was Mad Magazine
of the go-go 'SDs, that's correct.

198
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,196
-For grown-u ps.
-Right.

199
00:11:35,359 --> 00:11:37,714
Butl had known him in New York.

200
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,310
And I didn't know until afterwards
we'd had the wrong Eric Kaplan in.

201
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,233
Because when you came in,
I said, "I know this guy. He's very funny."

202
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,393
Eric Kaplans-- And this is not true
of other names. --are pretty fungible.

203
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:52,869
So all Eric Kaplans, we get together,
there's a sort of a....

204
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,315
They don't exceed a certain level
of quality...

205
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,916
...but we also make sure we don't drop
below a certain level of quality.

206
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:02,589
Now, before we go to, uh, questions
from the floor...

207
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:07,310
...Dave, you're the only person who hasn't
said a word so far. How's it going, man?

208

[CROWD LAUGHS]

210
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,189
No, I will say,
when we first started season one...

211
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,555
...it was incredible,
because we didn't know the show...

212
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,998
...but what we had was Bill's, uh,
experiences rooting it in real life...

213
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,391
...and Chuck's experiences
of having created so many shows.

214
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:28,676
And that was just an incredible, uh,
positive force.

215
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,753
I remember pitching once before we'd had
the first table read of the second episode.

216
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,354
And I pitched an idea,
and Chuck looked to me and he said:

217
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:41,550
"If we do that, you will ruin the show."
And I said, "Well, let's not do that."

218
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,234
All right, uh, we're now going to go from--

219
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,829
We're now gonna take some questions
from the floor, I believe.

220
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,235
Do we have that set up? Yes, we do.

221
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,231
[CROWD LAUGHS]

222
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:58,076
I think those stairs are the only exercise
those guys get.

223
00:12:59,319 --> 00:13:03,278
We had a guy in. They need parts.
So we're waiting.

224
00:13:03,439 --> 00:13:07,034
The thing about the elevator and the stairs...

225
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:10,714
...so there are a couple of problems
in shooting a sitcom...

226
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:15,236
...and one is, where do you shoot a scene
where people walk and talk?

227
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,313
So you can shoot it in a car
where they sort of drive and talk...

228
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,634
...or you can kind of do, you know,
a little outside set or something like that.

229
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,837
But what the stairwell gave us was a place...

230
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,715
...to have walk-and-talk conversations
that was organic.

231
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:37,910
So to make that stairwell, they dug a hole
in the floor of Stage 25...

232
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:43,473
...at Warner Bros. when we did the pilot,
and Stage 25 is the best stage to shoot in.

233
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:45,470
And when we got picked up to series,
they said:

234
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,791
"We're gonna move you to another stage,"
which was the worst stage.

235
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,633
And Chuck Lorre said,
"Great, just dig a hole in that stage."

236
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,999
And they said, "Oh, okay, well,
then you can stay where you are," so....

237
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:06,395
There was no grand plan at the time
for Bernadette and Amy...

238
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:10,916
...to go on and become the major staples
in the show that they are.

239
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:14,389
They did one appearance,
and we loved them in their auditions.

240
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:16,436
And itjust worked out, and we thought:

241
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,915
"They're great.
Let's put more of them in the show."

242
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:21,071
And that's how that happened.

243
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,993
And, uh, that's kind of how we go
at all these things.

244
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:29,075
If we get somebody and we add them and
it's seems to be going well, we'll do more.

...I think is pretty good proof of that, so....

249
00:14:47,439 --> 00:14:50,397
And one other--
Just while we're talking about the kiss.

250
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,676
That was such a stressful time
in the writers' room.

251
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:56,878
Like, we were sweating and pacing,
and trying to get that moment right...

252
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:01,430
...to the point that there is a version
of the kiss scene...

253
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:05,393
...a completely different version of it
that we wrote that no one has ever seen...

254
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:08,437
...because we were so panicked
that we needed to get it right.

255
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,029
What happened in the different version
of the kiss scene?

256
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,715
He was, in the other version-- In the version
that's on TV, he kind of went at her...

257
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:18,757
...and he was mad because he felt
that he was tricked to go on the train.

258
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,196
And there's a kinder, gentler version
where he kisses her...

259
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,636
...just because he's having
such a lovely experience on the train.

260
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,236
But I'm really happy
with the way we did it, so....

that if you ask us, supposing we said--

be happy?" And we said, "No.

character of Amy kind of different, I think.

Does that answer your question?

Or does it just scare you?

I mean, I think for me--
Um, and I'm in a great position...

291
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:19,988

these days is part-time.

and the guys have done.

00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:27,795
And the amazing thing
about these two characters...

294
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:32,636
...is that Sheldon will not move at all...

295
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,950
...and Amy will not let him not move.

296
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:43,117
And it's this-- Just watching Amy
move Sheldon is incredible.

297
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:49,230
Because I will say, "There's absolutely no
way Sheldon would ever do such-and-such."

298
00:17:49,399 --> 00:17:53,472
And then Steve will get angry,
and then he'll....

299
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:58,031
And then show how that would happen,
and you look at it and you say:

300
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,033
"Yeah, that would move him.
You know, that would...."

301
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,631
You know, and a lot of it has to do
with Sheldon doesn't wanna lose Amy.

He doesn't wanna be with Amy on her
terms, but he doesn't wanna lose her.

You, sir, are the real deal!
Welcome to Comic-Con 2014!

You passed our test. Good job. Steve?

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,027
lfl remember right,
that was Maria's pitch. I don't know.

322
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,510
No, uh, the Comic-Con thing actually
did come from our experiences...

323
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:38,909
...of buying tickets to Comic-Con
many, many years.

324
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:41,354
Comic-Com did change the system
this year a little bit...

325
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,954
...where they also don't tell you
what number you are in line.

326
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,954
I'm not saying they did that to screw us,
but we're on to you, Comic-Con.

327
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:52,756
We wanted to see if there would
be someone who would spot it...

tickets where you just stare the screen...

331
00:20:04,879 --> 00:20:07,757
...and don't say anything, not as interesting
on TV as you might imagine.

332
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,309
Good to have them-- They're earning
some money, they should say words.

333
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,199
May I interrupt just for a second?
I have a question of my own.

334
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:21,037
This season Penny was cast with Wil
Wheaton in the low-budget Serial Ape-ist.

335
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,394
MOLARO: Yes.
-Yeah.

336
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,596
Is there, uh, any chance
we'll ever get to see the whole movie?

337
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,115
Is that gonna--?
Is that something that may happen?

338
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:32,192
Well, I mean, we're kind of busy
writing the TV show, so probably not.

339
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:38,117
-I think people would enjoy it.
-Well, we might have a movie trailer.

340
00:20:38,999 --> 00:20:42,036
As if Serial Ape-ist was going to happen,
which it's not.

if there was a Serial Ape-ist movie...

-...would you do it? I think it would work.
-Yes.

353
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:27,111
Yes, I've actually pitched
a lot of story ideas to Steve.

354
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,473
How close are you
to actually making that happen?

355
00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:34,755
Because I'm in. I want to be part of this.

356
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,236
You know, we're not,
but every time we talk about it...

357
00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:40,867
...we get really excited,
the idea that this really hot girl...

358
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,678
-...is turning into a gorilla is kind of great.
-It would work.

We have the mask.

360
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,069
When we worked on the episodes
where that show is talked about...

361
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,358
...every time we--
I have fake orangutan hair in my mouth.

362
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,876
Every-- Every time we talked about it...

363
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:01,793
...we got more and more excited
about how we wanted it to be a real movie.

364
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,269
I think it should be a Kickstarter campaign.

365
00:22:04,439 --> 00:22:07,476
Do a Kickstarter campaign,
and you could all pay for it...

366
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,359
...and then go to see it.
I think it'd be great.

367
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,274
And Kaley loved having
that hair glued to her, so she--

368
00:22:14,439 --> 00:22:17,431
-That's not the way I remember it.
-No.

369
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,955
-The word wasn't "love"?
-No, it was--

370
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:22,428
I think if you were to take
the concept of love...

371
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,831
...and then fill up all the space
in the known multiverse...

372
00:22:25,999 --> 00:22:29,958
...you would get Kaley's emotion
at the other end of that.

373
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:36,355
Wil, you play yourself, of course, on the
show. How close is that to who you are?

374
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,717
Are you really...? Because, you know....

375
00:22:39,879 --> 00:22:45,590
I am not as evil, as far as anyone knows...

376
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,797
...as evil Wil Wheaton started out.

377
00:22:48,959 --> 00:22:53,430
When the relationship between Will
Wheaton and Sheldon sort of changed...

378
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,037
...and he became more of an ally
and a friend to him...

379
00:22:58,199 --> 00:23:03,990
...that character started to shift a lot closer
to who I am in my life.

380
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:09,472
So, what I'm hearing is a vague denial
of evil, but not a very strong one.

381
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,758
Well, I mean, I thinkthat's
the most appropriate way to deny evil.

382
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,911
But we did accurately build
your house on the stage.

383
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:20,958
You did. This is really funny. So Bill had
come to my house for a housewarming party.

384
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:26,716
And when Sheldon came over
to my house for the party...

385
00:23:26,879 --> 00:23:31,907
...I walked onto the set and everything
in that set looked like my house.

386
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,957
-That's weird.
-There's even a couch there...

387
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,908
...that I wanted to buy for my house,
but my wife talked me out of.

388
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,674
And then we hung lot of my art
on the walls in there.

389
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:46,039

painting, uh, is actually-- I own that.

[CROWD LAUGHS]

392
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:59,988
Sheldon is a hypochondriac, and I think
that a lot of the things that he claims...

393
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:05,552
...when it gets to medical stuff-- And we saw
when Leonard was dating a doctor.

394
00:24:05,719 --> 00:24:06,993
He does a lot of--

395
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,476
If he says "diagnosed with,"
that may have been by himself.

396
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,590
So there's a lot of Munchausen
with Sheldon...

397
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:21,787
...and, uh, you can't take him at his word
when he has a medical condition.

As the Google satellite camera
pulls back really fast...

401
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:37,515
...at the end of season five in the wedding,
you can see a big pink blob.

-That is Mrs. Wolowitz.
-In a hat.

It's like a bigfoot sighting.

Maybe, uh, on Nickelodeon or Nick Junior,
Big Bang Babies.

405
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:56,118
-You could do the animated series...
-We've talked about this.

...and they could solve crimes and....

407

at any point in the near--

[CROWD LAUGHS]

410
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:16,791
You know, because of who we are,
there's a lot of--

411
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,117
I mean, you heard about Eric's diatribe
against Star Wars...

412
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:24,875
...and why it's responsible for the ills of
man, but Steve hates the Green Lantern.

413
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,507
If it makes you feel better,
I also don't like Green Lantern...

414
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,397
-...so it's not just Aquaman.
-Yeah.

415
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:32,238
I'm not a writer on the show,
but I actually really like Aquaman.

419

[CROWD CHEERS]

420
00:25:44,199 --> 00:25:47,748
And I think it makes sense that for a planet
that is primarily covered with water...

421
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,991
...you would have superheroes
that exist in that environment.

422
00:25:55,159 --> 00:25:59,596
From the beginning,
the show has been written without a plan.

423
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:03,712
So when you sit down
to write an episode, you say:

424
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:08,078
"Presented with what happens in this
episode, what would the characters do?"

425
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,755
And that begins to define them
and there's.... You know, it's not--

426
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,275
You know, there's no road map set out.
It's the circumstance.

427
00:26:15,439 --> 00:26:18,556
You find out more
about the characters, so....

428
00:26:18,719 --> 00:26:21,187
And when you look at the growth
of the guys on the show...

429
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:26,194
...I think you can point to the ladies
for a big reason behind it.

430
00:26:27,439 --> 00:26:29,907
But also I think characters,
in order to care about them and--

431
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:35,597
You know, Wil was talking about how
his character at first was kind of broad.

432
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:41,232
And then that doesn't sustain after a while,
you have to find out who the character is.

433
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,749
Otherwise it's uncomfortable to watch.

434
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,592
And so I think that's the natural evolution
of all characters...

435
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,517
...hopefully, if things are working well...

436
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:52,228
...is they become realer,
and you learn more about them, and....

437
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,112
l have no end to that sentence.

Wait till we have to wrestle,
if and when they do get married...

441
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,118
...how we get around that part, so....

442
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:17,396
Would it be satisfying if we promised
that at some point we'll reveal...

443
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,039
...if we'll reveal her last name?
