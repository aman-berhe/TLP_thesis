Hello, I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
And welcome to:

[SHELDON GASPS]

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,109
I knew it was coming, still scary.

6
00:00:18,479 --> 00:00:19,912
Now, I'm sure you're thinking:

7
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:24,357
"The final episode? Who will stand
between us and flag ignorance?"

8
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:26,714
I know I was thinking that.

9
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:29,996
Is this a show on flags or mind reading?

10
00:00:30,479 --> 00:00:33,551
But the truth is I can no longer balance
a full-time career...

11
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,187
...a popular Internet show,
and a girlfriend.

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,909
And he really does have one,
you jerks on the comment board.

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,112
So as they say,
all good things must come to an end.

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,556
After only 232 episodes.

15
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:52,191
Two hundred thirty-three if we include the
one somebody forgot to press record on.

16
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:56,595
-You said you weren't gonna bring that up.
-And you said you pressed record.

17
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:03,792
Anyway, please, sit back, relax
and join us as we take our final lap...

18
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,475
...as indicated by the waving
of this racing flag.

19
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,154
Of course, white flags
can also represent surrender...

20
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,039
...the Stewards of Gondor,
and the Japanese Minamoto clan.

21
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:15,588
But I'm sure you remember
that from episode 62:

22
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,513
"White Flags:
Who's Waving Them and Why."

23
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,990
-That was a good one.
-That was so good.

24
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:50,958
You know, I thought cleaning out
a dead professor's office...

25
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,395
...was just going to be boring,
but then I found his dentures...

26
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,472
...and realized it's also gross.

27
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:01,837
Doesn't Professor Abbott's family
want any of this stuff?

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,911
-I don't think he had a family.
-That's rough.

29
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,274
I know. You can spend
your whole life working...

30
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,750
...and, at the end, all that's left
are some papers in a box.

31
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,114
Makes you think.

32
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:14,636
Oh,well.

33
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,837
Hey, we're supposed to look through
this before we throw it away...

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,515
-...in case it's important.
-I did. It's all outdated or disproved.

35
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,752
I don't know,
this old pen kind of proves gravity.

36
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:27,558
When ltilt it,
her bathing suit falls right off.

37
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,197
My dad used to have a pen like that.
l dated it all through sixth grade.

38
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,077
It still feels weird
just throwing away his work like this.

39
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,789
Don't feel bad, some day someone
will be throwing out your work too.

40
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:44,916
That someone was Sheldon
and the day was yesterday.

41
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,753
Hey, look at this.

"Dear Roger, to be opened upon
your first great discovery. Love, Mom."

43
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,397
Wow, look at the date.

44
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:58,232
He saved this 50 years
and never got to open it.

45
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,997
That's intense.

and now he's a little hug machine.

Come on. She's not that bad.

60
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,637
Oh, yeah? At the company picnic,
she yelled at me and my grandson...

...for losing the three-legged race.

62

He still calls her
"that mean kid with the big boobies."

I know she can be a little intense...

64

...but I swear,
she is so sweet once you get past--

-How much we love working with you.

Over the years here at Fun With Flags...

...we've had an opportunity
to learn, laugh, wonder....

69
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:18,916
And, yes, even shed a tear or two.

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,028
Like when you do a two-hour Fourth of July
spectacular and it doesn't get recorded.

do I have to say I'm sorry?

I set up to make that American flag.

[IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE]
l have no idea...

80
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,750
...because the story of me sewing
the first American flag...

81
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,308
...is unsupported poppycock.

82
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,031
Then who did sew it?

pests, such as jellyfish, are present.

Sing "Hakuna Matata"
like an 8-year-old girl?

Wrong, smarty-pants.

98

It's "Everything is Awesome"
from The Lego Movie.

99

Look at these notebooks.
They're full of pages and pages of data.

100
00:06:25,799 --> 00:06:27,596
He clearly spent years on this.

101
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,433
It's just columns of random numbers.
Toss it.

102
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,989
But what if this was a potential
breakthrough for him?

103
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,789
What if this is the thing that would've
let him open that bottle of champagne?

104
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:39,598
Maybe he didn't know what to pair
champagne with.

105
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,991
Strawberries, caviar, oysters,
all good choices.

106
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:47,709
That look right there is why people eat
before they come to your parties.

107
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:51,513
This has to mean something.

108
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:54,632
There's no discernible pattern
that I can see...

109
00:06:54,799 --> 00:06:57,518
...but it shouldn't be too hard
to run the numbers and check.

110
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,750
Maybe we can get some time
on the supercomputer.

111
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,830
Sure, we could try multiple regressions...

112
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,309
...with varying physical
and experimental constants.

113
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:08,155
We could run a pattern-matching algorithm
against unsolved physics problems.

114
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,438
Ooh, it might be a substitution cipher.
We could start with basic cryptanalysis.

115
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,751
Or we could go talk to this guy
he used to share an office with.

116
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,391
Oh, let's do that.

117
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,595
You don't know how
to do cryptanalysis, do you?

118
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,194
Yeah, I'm not even sure
if it's the right word.

He was the one crying like a wuss
the whole time.

I heard he was being picked on
by a mean kid, heh.

What's his problem?

128
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:02,195
I don't know, maybe he didn't like the fact
you called his grandson a wuss.

129
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:05,112
Well, I didn't think you were supposed
to say "sissy" anymore.

Okay, look, I know
what a good person you are...

you might come off a little harsh.

No, it's not racist.

this is the right building.

-Hi, we're from the university.

160
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,393
We're trying to get some information
about Professor Abbott.

161
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,632
We were cleaning out his office
and found these books full of numbers.

162
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,633
-Any chance you know what it is?
-He was always working on this.

163

l was thinking it might be
an interstellar coordinate system.

164
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,511
Maybe an updated version
of Hubble's law.

165
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,830
I keep seeing the number 90 repeating.

166
00:10:09,999 --> 00:10:12,672
That could be the angle of perturbation
of a distant galaxy.

167
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:17,789
It's the number of calories in a yogurt.
That's his food diary.

168
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:20,314
-Really?
-Yeah. He wrote down everything he ate.

169
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,995
He was convinced that calorie restriction
was the key to living forever.

170

-Does it work?
-Seriously?

171
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:29,554

On the bright side, you didn't have to listen
to his stomach growl for 35 years.

174

So was there anything Professor Abbott
worked on during his life...

175
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,756
...that came close to an accomplishment?

176
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,310
To be honest,
his research never amounted to anything.

177
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,789
You were his colleague.
How did yours turn out?

178
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,714
Great, this is the apartment you get
when you win a Nobel.

179
00:10:54,439 --> 00:10:57,954
You could be very frugal. I'm getting
a little tired of everybody's sarcasm.

180
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,436
I'm not a bully.
I mean, maybe I come off a little strong...

181
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,354
...but that's because my dad raised me to be
tough and not to take crap from anybody.

182
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,987
That's fine. There's a difference
between being tough...

183
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,550
...and telling your friend
her new pants look like a saggy diaper.

184
00:11:17,999 --> 00:11:19,478
I did say that, didn't I?

185
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:23,234

I had to return them.

I feel like everybody hates me.

I'd like to take a moment to personally
thank Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler...

is the first woman to co-host...

00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:53,033
I'd like to share with you all
one last use for a white flag:

209
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,435

That's the end of Roger Abbott.

And we still don't know who framed him.

217
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:33,236
I still keep thinking about how an entire life
can seemingly amount to nothing.

218
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,395
I guess the sad truth is not everyone
will accomplish something great.

219

in the little moments that make up life.

to celebrate an achievement.

gets their first big breakthrough...

champagne and toasting Professor Abbott.

stop paying for our coffee.

-Five months ago.
