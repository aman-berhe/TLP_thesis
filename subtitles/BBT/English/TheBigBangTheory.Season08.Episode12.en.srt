1
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,358
What color would you like to be?

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,954
Oh. I'd like to be green.
But you know you always take it.

3
00:00:08,159 --> 00:00:10,957
That's not true. Any color's fine with me.

4
00:00:11,159 --> 00:00:14,868
I can be a combination of blue and yellow.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,559
-Blue and yellow make green.
-Ah, then it's settled.

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,278
Hi. Ready to go?

7
00:00:22,479 --> 00:00:26,233
Good news. We ordered lunch so we can all
stay here and play Lord of the Rings Risk.

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,913
Sheldon, we said that we would
play games with you tonight.

9
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,828
We'll still be playing it tonight.
This game can easily take 8 hours.

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,315
-Sweetie, you thought I'd wanna do this?
-No.

11
00:00:36,519 --> 00:00:37,508
-Did you tell him?
-Yes.

12
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:39,710
Did you say it out loud with words?

13
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:42,117


14
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,754
I don't wanna spend the
day playing a board game.

15
00:00:44,959 --> 00:00:48,747
You may change your mind when you hear
that this is the new expanded edition...

16
00:00:48,959 --> 00:00:51,109
...which contains a
complete map of Middle-earth.

17
00:00:51,319 --> 00:00:53,879
Now including the Haradwaith territories.

18
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:57,999
I will literally race you to the car.

19
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,151
No. Come on. Don't leave. Just try it.

20
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,193
We're always doing what you guys want.
It'd be nice if you did something we wanted.

21
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,356
You wanna be green?

22
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,672
They really have tried to like
a lot of the same stuff we're into.

23
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:13,915
Yeah. We do game nights.
Video game nights.

24
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:16,838
-We watch films with director's commentary.
-Oh, my favorite.

25
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:20,793
George Lucas can talk through Star Wars.
I say one word. I'm banished to the kitchen.

26
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:24,999
Today, Amy and l are
deciding what we're all gonna do.

27
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,918
You got it. You girls are in charge.

28
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,712
-Thank you.
-Sheldon?

29
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:30,918
Fine.

30
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,190
Now that we're not playing,
you can be green.

31
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,672
-Thank you.
-Since you're green, I can be next time.

32
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,395
Let's see. What's something fun
the guys would never take us to do?

33
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,198
I know.
We could go horseback riding.

34
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,319
I actually can't.
My hips don't open wider than 22 degrees.

35
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:54,435
I rode a very thin pony once.
On the first bump...just popped right off.

36
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,712
All right, what do you wanna do?

37
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,390
There's a craft and
folk art museum on Wilshire.

38
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,636
Well, that's Wilshire's problem.

39
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,112
There's gotta be something fun
we can do that the guys will hate.

40
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,158
Hang on. Why do we have to hate it?

41
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:12,237
Three words. Doctor Who convention.

42
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,512
I did not force you to go to that.

43
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,348
You walked out of the house in a fez
and bowtie. I went so you didn't get beat up.

44
00:02:18,559 --> 00:02:22,313
-I wasn't gonna get beat up.
-You were, but somehow, I held myself back.

45
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,590
You know what you could make us do?
Ice skating.

46
00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:27,790
The cold air will trigger Leonard's asthma.

47
00:02:27,999 --> 00:02:31,753
And it plays right into my well-known fear
of getting flattened by a Zamboni.

48
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,713
Now you're helping them
find ways to make us miserable?

49
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:38,877
I'm sorry, Leonard. I'm a problem solver.
It's what I do.

50
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:44,588
I actually can't go ice skating.
l have unnaturally brittle ankles.

51
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,995
Is there any part
of your body that's normal?

52
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,829
[CHUCKLES]

53
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,956
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-Will you please relax?

54
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,036
-I can't take it, dude.
-You okay?

55
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,879
No, I'm not okay.
I feel like I'm gonnajump out of my skin.

56
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,794
Told you not to wax down there.

57
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:29,069
It's itchy when it grows back.

58
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:33,711
I'm worried about the
New Horizons space probe.

59
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:36,308
-What's he talking about?
-Nine years ago...

60
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:40,353
...he was part of a team that launched
a spacecraft to collect data about Pluto.

61
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:43,596
It's finally close enough so
this morning, it turned itself on.

62
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:46,916
We hope. The signal has to
travel over 3 billion miles.

63
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,509
It's gonna be hours before
we know if it even survived.

64
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,359
We get to see him flip out. He's
worried it was demolished by space ice.

65
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:54,277
Space ice is no joke.

66
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,397
I can't even watch Frozen anymore.

67
00:04:00,559 --> 00:04:03,437
Oh, the Philharmonic
is playing Beethoven downtown.

68
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:07,871
Before you say yes,
it's not the movie about the big dog.

69
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:13,274
How come we can't think
of something we both wanna do?

70
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,990
Because you always pick what we do
and ljust go along with it?

71
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,791
LEONARD:
Ah. Interesting.

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,797
We're being accused of making
you do things you don't like.

73
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,991
And you are doing the same thing.

74
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,236
You should point out the hypocrisy of that.

75
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:31,037
That's what I was doing.

76
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,676
Oh, that wasn't clear.

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,391
Try it again, but drive it home with,
"How do you like them apples, missy?"

78
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:40,828
All right. Keep thinking.

79
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:43,116
You're making it too complicated.

80
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:44,832
Why not stick to the basics?

81
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:49,351
Go shopping for clothes while Leonard
and I sit and hold your purses.

82
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,755
I know I'd hate that. Leonard?

83
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,996
Well, yeah.

84
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,028
Now then. It's settled.

85
00:04:57,239 --> 00:04:58,877
What do you say?
Sounds kind of perfect.

86
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:02,918
It does. Somehow he managed
to take all the fun out of it.

87
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:04,757
Well, once again, it's what I do.

88
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,589
Ugh. Another two hours to go.
The wait is killing me.

89
00:05:11,799 --> 00:05:12,948
I get it.

90
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,109
When I was in the Soyuz capsule
plummeting towards Earth--

91
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,709
Before you finish, is this a story
about patience and waiting...

92
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,514
...orjust another reminder
that you went to space?

93
00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:28,669
A story can do two things.

94
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:31,473
I feel like I'm gonna have a heart attack.

95
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,911
You work in pharmaceuticals.
Don't you have anything you can give him?

96
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,552
All I have is our new urine flow drug.

97
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,312
It won't help with his anxiety,
but it's so strong when he pees...

98
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,909
...he'll fly around like he's got ajetpack.

99
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,430
I can't stop thinking about it.

100
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,153
You know, worrying won't have
any effect on what happens.

101
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:54,476
-I know.
-Maybe you could do something productive.

102
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,233
Okay.

103
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,513
lfl make this shot in the trash can...

104
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,636
...the probe will have arrived
in perfect working order.

105
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:12,594
In addition to being crazy, you're resting the
fate of the mission on your athletic prowess.

106
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:16,595
-Yes.
-The man who crashed his stationary bike.

107
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:23,551
I didn't crash it, okay? My playlist was
too uptempo. I got lightheaded and I fell off.

108
00:06:25,359 --> 00:06:26,633
Okay.

109
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:28,952
It all...

110
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,116
...comes down...

111
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,393
...to this.

112
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,149
You happy? Now you can relax.

113
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:41,908
What kind of scientist are you? Everyone
knows you gotta make two out of three.

114
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:50,910
This isn't so bad.

115
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:55,598
That's easy for you to say.
Your chair's not facing the lingerie section.

116
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,630
Boy, that's a lot of panties.

117
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,039
You guys comfy? This might take a while.

118
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:07,073
I don't understand why women insist on
making a production out of buying clothes.

119
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:09,031
You're right. We should do what you do.

120
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,879
Have our mom send us pants
from the Walmart in Houston.

121
00:07:13,359 --> 00:07:16,590
They have a man there who
understands my personal style.

122
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:18,834
Bye.

123
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,835
Uh, I've got some bad news.
There's no cell service in here.

124
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,434
Oh.

125
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:26,716
Well, that's all right.

126
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:29,877
There were ways to pass the time
before smartphones were invented.

127
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:31,432
Mm-hm. That's true.

128
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,591
I'll look them up.

129
00:07:36,359 --> 00:07:38,429
Son of a biscuit.

130
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:41,554
-Sheldon, it's fine.
-No, it's not fine.

131
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,752
What kind of store in the
21st century doesn't at least have Wi-Fi?

132
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:47,473
I'm gonna call their corporate office--
Son of a biscuit.

133
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,708
Let's see.

134
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,834
My armies are going to attack
the Shire from Buckland.

135
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,713
And I roll...

136
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,510
...a five and a three.

137
00:08:07,719 --> 00:08:12,076
Okay. And to defend, I roll...

138
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,952
...two sixes. I win.

139
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:21,194
Boy, double sixes again. If I didn't see it
with my own eyes, I wouldn't believe it.

140
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,470
I wonder how long
we're gonna be stuck here.

141
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:28,432
I don't know. The girls do a lot for us.
It's the least we can do.

142
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,790
It's true. I suppose it's only
fair we make compromises.

143
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,199
Look at you being all mature.

144
00:08:35,439 --> 00:08:37,953
I don't know why you're so surprised.

145
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,597
If there's one thing I know after living with
you for years, it's how to compromise.

146
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,312
I'm sorry.

147
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,475
You make compromises for me?

148
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,592
All the time.

149
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,313
On Earth?

150
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,632
In our lives?

151
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:01,188
That we're living?

152
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,352
Well, yes.

153
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:08,236
Just yesterday, you had a big piece
of lettuce stuck in your teeth at lunch.

154
00:09:08,439 --> 00:09:11,431
Did I say anything? No.

155
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:16,628
l compromised and kept my mouth shut.

156
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,037
Like you should have
because everyone was laughing at you.

157
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,913
That is not a compromise.

158
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,476
Compromise is me driving you everywhere
because you refuse to learn how.

159
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:30,672
-I learned how. Amy taught me.
-What? Why don't you do it?

160
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,518
Well, it's scary.

161
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:37,511
And sometimes I get
the pedals mixed up.

162
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:43,919
But more importantly, driving me to work
is something that gives your life purpose.

163
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:50,032
I can't take that away from you,
so what do I do?

164
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:54,507
Oh, come on.
I'm practically feeding you the answer.

165
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,550
l compromise.

166
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,669
Hey, thanks for keeping me company.

167
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:05,713
I'm happy to. I think getting out
of the apartment will do you good.

168
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:09,476
-Where are we headed?
-If it's okay with you, I'd like to go to temple.

169
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,833
Buddy, trust me.
You don't wanna convert to Judaism.

170
00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:20,790
I mean, I knowl make it look cool,
but it's not all briskets and dreidels.

171
00:10:21,599 --> 00:10:23,271
I meant a Hindu temple.

172
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:26,552
Oh, okay.

173
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:29,398
It's not like Indiana Jones
and the Temple of Doom, right?

174
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,433
Some bald guy with horns
isn't gonna rip my heart out?

175
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:35,278
Dude, that movie is an imperialist fantasy...

176
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,438
...that makes the followers
of a beautiful and peaceful religion...

177
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,278
...look like bloodthirsty barbarians.

178
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,756
-You love that movie.
-Yeah, it's pretty great.

179
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,430
-l'm surprised to see you get religious.
-Why?

180
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,630
Because I've known you for 10 years
and you've never gone to temple.

181
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:57,307
You never talked about believing in God.

182
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:03,071
And last Diwali, you ate two pounds
of sacred cow at a Brazilian steakhouse.

183
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:06,432
Religion is a very personal thing.

184
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:08,709
I do go to temple. I just don't talk about it.

185
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:11,274
-Yeah, but you're a scientist.
-So?

186
00:11:11,479 --> 00:11:14,596
As a scientist, the way to understand
the universe is facts and evidence.

187
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:19,395
And now, you're counting on some
blue chick with 100 arms to help you?

188
00:11:19,599 --> 00:11:23,228
That is offensive. Does everything you know
about Hinduism come from Indiana Jones?

189
00:11:23,439 --> 00:11:26,317
No, there's also Apu from The Simpsons.

190
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,836
Well, lots of scientists believe in God.

191
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,238
Newton. Faraday. Pascal. All were believers.

192
00:11:35,439 --> 00:11:38,112
Even Einstein was famous
for attacking quantum theory...

193
00:11:38,319 --> 00:11:41,356
...on the grounds that God does not
play dice with the universe.

194
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,996
Of course he believed in God.
He slept with Marilyn Monroe.

195
00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:49,158
-Actually, there's no proof of that.
-Believe in your religion. I'll believe in mine.

196
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:54,475
-How's it going in there?
-Eh.

197
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,715
Not really a great outfit for work.

198
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,310
Unless something opens up
in the hookers and whores division.

199
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:04,349
-Hey, can I ask you something?
-Sure.

200
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,956
Do I force you to do things
you don't want to?

201
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,038
-Yeah, but it's okay.
-How is that okay?

202
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:14,307
I promised myself if I ever got friends,
I'd do whatever they said.

203
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:18,597
Really, I'm lucky you
found me before a cult did.

204
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,916
Well, that was a long time ago.
You're a different woman now.

205
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,318
You're smart. You've got great friends.
You've got a boyfriend. You're pretty.

206
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,477
You have zero fashion sense.

207
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:32,715
Tonight, we're gonna do
whatever you want.

208
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,752
-Really?
-Absolutely. You name it. We're doing it.

209
00:12:37,319 --> 00:12:39,913
Basket weaving at the craft museum.

210
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,311
Well, you named it.

211
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,871
Oh, here's another one.

212
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,039
lwish that the apple pancake mix
was on the top shelf...

213
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,073
...because it starts with an A.
But I don't put it there because...

214
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:00,319
...I don't want you breaking your legs when
you're supposed to be making breakfast.

215
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:05,558
Is it my turn to talk about
the compromises I make?

216
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,518
I wasn't done, but go ahead.

217
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,868
He said, compromising.

218
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,310
Because of you, I'm not allowed to adjust
the temperature in my own home.

219
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,875
I'm not allowed to whistle.
I don't wear shoes that might squeak.

220
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,435
Well, you're a physicist, not a circus clown.

221
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:29,033
Sheldon, do you realize I don't live with
the woman I love because of you?

222
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,559
No other reason. Just you.

223
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,831
-Is that true?
-Yes, it's true.

224
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:37,998
The last time I brought it up, you had a
breakdown, got on a train, and ran away.

225
00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:42,477
Well, given my history on subject,
it seems a little reckless to bring it up now.

226
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,117
You have no idea
how much you inconvenience...

227
00:13:47,319 --> 00:13:49,958
...the lives of everyone around you.
It's exhausting.

228
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:51,387
You know what?

229
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,509
You think you're so tolerant,
but the truth is...

230
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,199
...you're mean to me a lot.

231
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,470
Yeah, you think that I don't notice all those
sarcastic comments and eye rolls, but I do.

232
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,750
l have excellent peripheral vision.

233
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:09,357
On a good day, I can see my ears.

234
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:16,236
Sheldon, I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.
I've been holding a lot of this in for a while.

235
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:20,398
I'm sorry too. And if you want to live with
Penny then I think you should.

236
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,916
-You mean that?
-Yes. Just...

237
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,476
...put on your squeaky shoes
and eeh-eeh-eeh your way out of my life.

238
00:14:29,359 --> 00:14:31,077
Come on. Don't get upset.

239
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:34,393
I'm not upset. I'm just...

240
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,115
...imagining a world
without my best friend in it.

241
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,351
-Sheldon.
-lt's okay.

242
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:46,749
I'm not leaving your world.
I'm just talking about living across the hall.

243
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:47,994
I understand.

244
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:50,474
Either way, I want you to know that...

245
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:54,116
...l'm aware of how difficult
I can be so I just wanna say...

246
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,155
...thank you for putting up with me.

247
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,393
Buddy.

248
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,470
How are you guys getting--
Why are there tears?

249
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,756
Everything's fine. We just started
talking about living arrangements.

250
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:15,031
Are you crazy? You know he's a flight risk.

251
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:18,747
It's exactly what I told him.

252
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:23,272
We know this is a sensitive subject.
Leonard won't move until you're ready.

253
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,033
Well, what if you did it gradually?

254
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:35,549
All right. Well, how about we start with
two nights a week, I live with Penny.

255
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,794
How about one night and...

256
00:15:39,999 --> 00:15:41,478
...I let you whistle.

257
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,428
-Okay.
-When I'm not home.

258
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,152
You got it.

259
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,830
There we go. Compromising again.

260
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:59,789
We really are the best.

261
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:10,313
Here we go. My first Hindu temple.

262
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:14,307
You see behind the fountain,
that tower that looks like a pyramid?

263
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,991
It's called a shikhara. It symbolizes the
unity between the human and the divine.

264
00:16:19,599 --> 00:16:22,159
Huh. I always thought it was mini-golf.

265
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,873
All right. Shall we?

266
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,718
Yeah. Just--

267
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,833
-Anything I should know before I go in?
-Like what?

268
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,634
Like am I dressed okay?

269
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,715
Really? So every other place you've been,
you thought this was fine?

270
00:16:39,439 --> 00:16:41,794
I know you're under pressure
so I'm gonna let that pass.

271
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:45,752
Sorry. You're right. I'm so stressed.

272
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:51,431
Whenever I walk into that temple,
I realize whatever happens, it's okay.

273
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,596
We're all part of an immense pattern
and though we can't understand it...

274
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,633
...we can be happy to know
it's working its will through us.

275
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,511
That's nice.

276
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,234
Whether you call it God,
or the universe, or the self...

277
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,238
...we're all interconnected
and that's just a beautiful--

278
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,511
Son of a bitch, that guyjust dinged my car.

279
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,749
[HUFFS]

280
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:15,433
Seriously?
You were just gonna drive away?

281
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,359
Like my life isn't hard enough right now.

282
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,871
A space probe might be destroyed.
My parents are going through a divorce.

283
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:25,832
The guy who cuts my dog's hair
just gave her bangs.

284
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,835
Raj .

285
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:31,031
You saw. She looks like
Jim Carrey from Dumb and Dumber.

286
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:35,709
Raj, you just got a text.
The probe turned on. It's fine.

287
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:39,074
Oh, good.

288
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:42,591
Namaste, grandpa.

289
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,951
I thought this was gonna be boring,
but it's actually kind of fun.

290
00:17:54,159 --> 00:17:57,754
Don't tell Amy that.
We'll be here every Sunday.

291
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,508
Sheldon, that really is an excellent basket.

292
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,271
It's not a basket. It's a
soldier's helmet from 16th century China.

293
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,154
Very nice.

294
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,757
Yeah. Looks great.

295
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,637
I saw that.

296
00:18:24,439 --> 00:18:28,034
Well, roomie.
It's only one night a week, but it's a start.

297
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,755
-I know. I'm really proud of Sheldon.
-Yeah. I'm proud of him too.

298
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,073
Can you keep it down?
Some of us are trying to sleep out here.
