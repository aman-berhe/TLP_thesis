00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,875
So tell me about your day.
How's it going with the particle detector?

2
00:00:07,039 --> 00:00:08,472
Wow, you remember that?

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,033
Yeah, I listen to what you say.

4
00:00:10,239 --> 00:00:13,595
You're building a particle detector
using superfluid helium.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,315
You know, when you talk like that
I want to take you right here on this table.

6
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:21,237
You know from experience
this table cannot support both our weight.

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,756
So how's the detector going?

8
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:26,790
It's tricky working with superfluids.

9
00:00:26,999 --> 00:00:30,912
Whatever container you put them in, they
creep up the sides and crawl out.

10
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,314
Kind of like Sheldon's ant farm.

11
00:00:33,519 --> 00:00:36,317
Exactly. Except you don't have
a lunatic running around yelling:

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,909
"I fed you sugar water.
Why are you biting me?"

13
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:40,148
Ha.

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,558
You really want to talk about this?

15
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,389
I do. I didn't write "superfluid helium"
on this napkin for nothing.

16
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,956
Okay, well, this is cool. There's a thing
called superfluid vacuum theory...

17
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,630
...where empty space is imagined
as a superfluid with all of its qualities:

18
00:00:55,839 --> 00:00:58,512
Viscosity, density, surface tension....

19
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:04,228
If you're pausing for dramatic effect,
I'd keep it moving.

20
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,598

00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,109
[SIGHS]

22
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,032
People don't talk about surface tension.

23
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,430
If you imagine our three-space...

24
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,677
...as the surface of an N-dimensional
superfluid bubble....

25
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,758
This is exciting.

26
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,713
This is really exciting.
I have to go find Sheldon.

27
00:01:22,919 --> 00:01:25,831
Okay, well, if you find him,
use the kitchen island.

28
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,554
That coffee table
will not support both of you.

29
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,628
Which means a spherical
multidimensional superfluid...

30
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,910
...shows the same
negative energy density as space-time.

31
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:38,349
What do you think? So, what do you think?

32
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,239
Hmmm.

33
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,310
What? Is it wrong?
Have you seen it somewhere else?

34
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,679
Hmmm.

35
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,638
I know this isn't my area,
and I could never do math like you can...

36
00:01:54,839 --> 00:01:56,511
...but could this be something?

37
00:01:57,799 --> 00:01:59,391
[SHELDON SIGHS]

38
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,189
Well, you could've set
Newton's gravitational constant to one.

39
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:08,075
And the whole thing reeks of blueberry.
You know I can't stand scented markers.

40
00:02:09,079 --> 00:02:11,229
No one told you to taste them.

41
00:02:12,279 --> 00:02:14,235
Come on, is this good or not?

42
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,033
-lt's good.
-Really?

43
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,275
I like it. I think you're onto something.

44
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,550
-You do? Not messing with me?
-Not at all.

45
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,957
In fact, I have got something
forjust such an occasion.

46
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,232
l was starting to think I might never
get a chance to give it to you.

47
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:31,551
Good job.

48
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,790
You're giving me a sticker.

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,592
Notjust a sticker.

50
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:43,758
It's a sticker of a kitty saying "mee-wow."

51
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,598
I'm not a preschooler.

52
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,110
-Fine, I'll take it back.
-I earned this. Back off.

53
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,719
You're still awake?

54
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,470
For a man whose last observation...

55
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,275
...was our universe may be the surface of
a multidimensional supercooled liquid...

56
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,278
..."you're still awake" seems
like quite the sophomore slump.

57
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,671
You worked out all the math.

58
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,269
Oh, I did more than work out all the math.

59
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:36,071
I wrote a paper.

60
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,432
You wrote a paper on my idea?

61
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:42,437
I wrote a paper on our idea.

62
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,790
When did my idea become our idea?

63
00:03:44,999 --> 00:03:47,559
When I mixed it with Sheldony goodness...

64
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:50,398
...and cooked it
in the Easy-Bake Oven of my mind.

65
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,392
This is good.

66
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,999
Our idea's really good.

67
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,954
Well, the light bulb in this oven
is ridiculously bright.

68
00:04:01,399 --> 00:04:04,596
You know, if no one's thought of this yet,
this could be a big deal.

69
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,236
Only way we'll know for sure
is if we post it online to the pre-print server.

70
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,512
l have it ready to go,
but I wasn't gonna do it without you.

71
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,553
It's all happening so fast.

72
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,189
Should we sleep on it?

73
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,474
We could, but we always run the risk
of someone else beating us to the punch.

74
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:24,994
You're sure it's good?

76
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,757
That is a surefire mark of quality.

00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:39,710
Okay, partner, let's do it.

79
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,273
Come on.

80

-Click.

Yes, we did, my friend.

85
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,508
-Is your tongue blue?
-I don't want to talk about it.

86
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:09,629
-Movie night. What do you wanna watch?
-What happened to that movie you were in?

87
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:11,636
Oh, God, probably nothing.

88
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,674
I think I saw the director
twirling a sign outside the Verizon store.

89
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:18,675
-Search for it.
-What--? No, why?

90
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:21,677
-Because it would be fun to watch.
-It would be humiliating.

91
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:23,995
Well, now we have two reasons.

92
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,719
They have it.

93
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,876
-Please, can we watch it?
-Please.

94
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,195
Fine. But I'm telling you, it's terrible.

95
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,470
-Have you even seen it?
-No.

96
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,432

-No.
-Then we're probably okay.

on the Quantum Diaries physics blog.

-Let me see. Let me see.

-Oh, the pleasure is mine, Mr. Innovative.

336
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,628
He does whatever a spider can.

337
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,720

343
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:03,358
Yeah, okay, I'm good.
