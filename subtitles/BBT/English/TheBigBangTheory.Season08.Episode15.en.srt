1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,718
I've invented a science joke...

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,757
-...would you like to hear it?
-Sure.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,152
How many Edisons does it take
to screw in a lightbulb?

4
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:13,518
-How many?
-Who cares?

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,956
He stole the idea
and doesn't deserve his own joke.

6
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:18,438
Is that really true?

7
00:00:18,599 --> 00:00:20,874
Of course.
That's how you know it's a good joke.

8
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,554
It not only entertains, it informs.

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,873
Hey, sorry to interrupt.

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,827
Barry, uh, how many Edisons does it take
to screw in a lightbulb?

11
00:00:30,999 --> 00:00:34,036
Did you know Edison
didn't actually invent the lightbulb?

12
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:38,470
What do you want, Barry?

13
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,514
Just wanted to drop this off
as a little thank-you for Amy.

14
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:44,352
-What's this for?
-Your idea really helped me out.

15
00:00:44,519 --> 00:00:46,953
My light-cone quantization paper's
online already.

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,270
The response has been amazing.

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,556
That's fascinating, I can't wait to read it.

18
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,199
Oh, no. Me, as well.

19
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:57,238
Please e-mail it to Sheldon@Bazinga.biz.

20
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:00,038
Why "dot biz"?
Because I just gave you the business.

21
00:01:01,319 --> 00:01:03,708
And also, Bazinga.com was taken.

22
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,592
Anyway, than ks again.

23

Cooper, suck eggs.

24
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:12,750
Since when do you help out Barry Kripke?

25
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,230
I'd been thinking about a cellular approach
to neuronal connectivity...

26
00:01:16,399 --> 00:01:19,038
...and thought it might have applications
to string theory.

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,668
-lt's not a big deal.
-Oh, really?

28
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,149
When I was doing string theory
and hit a dead end...

29
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,958
...why didn't you try to help me?

30
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,680
I did. You said the only math
biologists know...

31
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,038
...is if you have three frogs and one
hops away, that leaves two frogs.

32
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:36,189
That's pretty funny, that does sound like me.

33
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,193
But it doesn't mean you should be
standing on street corners...

34
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,318
...handing out your math
to whatever guy comes along.

35
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,598
Sheldon, we're all scientists.
I helped out a fellow colleague.

36
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,638
-You're being petty.
-l'm being petty?

37
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,509
You know Barry and l have
a professional rivalry.

38
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,955
You heard him, he told me to suck eggs.

39
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,156
If we were friends, he would've suggested
I suck something pleasant.

40
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,038
Why are you laughing?

41
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,156
Did you learn something?

42
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,793
Okay, Ma, say hi to Aunt Gladys.

43
00:02:32,999 --> 00:02:35,035
Yeah, I love you too. Bye.

44
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,589
-Your mom having fun in Florida?
-Oh, she loves it.

45
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,395
She finally found a place where
everyone talks about how sweaty they are.

46
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,080
She wants us to go to the house
and check in on Stuart.

47
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:47,309
"Because he might be lonely."

48
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,913
She's just being nice.

49
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,595
I'm her son, how come she doesn't
send someone to check on me if I'm lonely?

50
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,479
Because you have a wife?

51
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,392
Yeah, well, sometimes you work late.

52
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:03,070
I know you don't like Stuart in the house...

53
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,038
...but the store's about to reopen,
he'll get back on his feet.

54
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,749
That'd be great. I'd love for things
between me and Mom to get back to normal.

55
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:13,235
Well, normal's a strong word, but sure.

56
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,590
-Hey.
-Hello.

57
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,151
-You okay?
-If I was okay...

58
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,958
...I would've said "Hello"
and not the more ominous "Hello."

59
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,954
-What's going on?
-l'm mad at Amy.

60
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:32,749
Did she leave pit stains
in your favorite crop top too?

61
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,833


62
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,676
She helped Barry Kripke make
an advancement in string theory.

63
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,751
Oh. That sounds like a good thing.

64
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:43,308
Well, it would be, except I left string theory...

65
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:45,390
...because I decided it was a dead end...

66
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:49,235
...and then she went behind my back
to help someone else prove me wrong.

67
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,753
My rival, no less.

00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,076
I'm sorry you had to see that.

70
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,320
I'm sorry I didn't have a camera.

71
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,959
Why would she do this to me?

72
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:11,792
Well, I'm sure she didn't
upset you on purpose.

73
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,748
Don't you say there's nothing more
important than the advancement of science?

74
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:20,318
No. I said there's nothing more important
than me advancing science.

75
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,277
If I'm understanding this
and all she did was help another scientist...

76
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,000
...l'm thinking you might have to
let this one go.

77
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:30,470
Ugh. "Let it go."
I have heard that my whole life.

78
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,234
Every time something upsets me,
somebody says, "Let it go."

79
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,550
Like it's my fault
and it's not okay to feel the way I feel.

81

I don't know what to tell you.
Why don't you talk to her?

82
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,159
Is that all you have? Shopworn tidbits
like, "Talk to her" and "Let it go"?

83
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:47,197
Gee, Penny, life's given me lemons,
what should I do?

84
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:49,435
Well, you could shove them somewhere.

85
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,995
Okay, now you're getting creative.

86
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,068
Thanks again for your help.

-No problem. Place really looks great.
-Our pleasure.

88
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,875
Yeah, you should have burned it down
years ago.

89
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,195
I keep telling you, I didn't burn it down.

90
00:05:05,359 --> 00:05:09,511
We know. Because burning something
down for the insurance money is a crime.

91
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:13,555

Yeah, she said I could use it.
Doesn't it look great?

98
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,079
Not as great as it looks in the den,
where it belongs.

-Howie.
-Why don't you clean out the whole room?

I made her in third grade...

101
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,871
...and the ribbon I got in swim class
for putting my face in the water.

102
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,428
What is your problem? She said it was okay.

103
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,954
Well, I'm her son. And I say it's not okay.

10 minutes on that clown art.

Oh, give me that.

117
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,190
Just out of curiosity...

118
00:06:43,359 --> 00:06:47,272
...if I were to let something go,
how would I do that?

119
00:06:47,799 --> 00:06:50,154
I don't know,
just think about something else.

00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:54,556
-Can I think about the spiny anteater?
-Sure.

The spiny anteater...

122
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:00,867
...never went behind my back
and worked with Barry Kripke.

123
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,190
That didn't help at all.

00:07:10,239 --> 00:07:11,752
Okay.

127
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:15,112
Imagine your problems are a pen.

128
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,277
-Okay.
-Now, imagine you're holding that pen.

129
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,672
Okay.

130
00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:29,719
Now, open your hand and let it go.

131
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,792
But I just got this pen.

00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:35,799

00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:47,509
-I may have a better way you can teach me.
-How?

136
00:07:47,999 --> 00:07:50,832

that over the past few months...

...Amy has secretly been
giving you little puzzles...

...to test your intelligence
against chimpanzees in her lab?

00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,390
-What? She didn't give me any puzzles.
-Are you sure?

00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:19,470
Can you help?

144
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,839
Penny, I really want to eat this banana...

145
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:32,038
...but it's stuck inside
this bamboo puzzle box.

146
00:08:34,199 --> 00:08:36,394
Son of a bitch!

147
00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:39,957
Okay. That's great. Now, let it go.

148
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:47,957
I can't believe you were testing me
against a chimp!

149
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,671
Excuse me, Amy was testing you,
I was rooting for you.

150
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,078
Good job on that banana box, by the way.

151
00:08:57,239 --> 00:08:59,150
Why would she even do this?

152
00:08:59,319 --> 00:09:01,355
She's been conducting
an experiment on apes...

153
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,476
...where they're given puzzles to solve.

154
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:05,948
l was surprised
at the complexity of the puzzles...

155
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,190
...and thought some humans
wouldn't solve them.

156
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,477
And that's when Amy said,
"Wanna make this interesting?"

157
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,478
Make this interesting?
You bet money on me?

158
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:18,995
No, no, we designed an experiment
involving you.

159
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,549
See, now, isn't that interesting?

160
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,672
It's not interesting, it's incredibly insulting.

161
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,795
Okay, maybe this will help.

162
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,190
Imagine you're holding a pen.

163
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:34,153
Before you go too far, not a special pen...

164
00:09:34,319 --> 00:09:35,957
...with your initials engraved on it.

165
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,514
-That'll make the next part really hard.
-Oh, my God.

166
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,113
That's it. Get out.

167
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,191
I don't understand why you're mad at me.

168
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,796
You should be mad at Amy,
like I was this afternoon.

169
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:48,757
-Hey, look at that, I let it go.
-Get out!

170
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,396
SHELDON: Penny.
-What?

171
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,471
I think I left my pen in there.

172
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:00,432
I understand why you're upset...

173
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:02,948
...but he worked really hard
to get the store ready.

174
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,315
And it's just furniture.

175
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:06,832
It's my mom's furniture.

176
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:10,196
It belongs in the house I grew up in
next to that pile of TV Guides...

177
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,318
...and in plain view of what,
for a 10-year-old...

178
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:15,595
...was a quality piece of string art!

179
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,472
Howie, if the store succeeds...

180
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:22,836
...Stuart has a source of income
and can move out of your mother's house.

181
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:25,752
It seems some furniture
is a reasonable price to pay for that.

182
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:29,478
That is a good point.
I didn't marry you for good points.

183
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,189
I married you to blindly support me
no matter how ridiculous I'm being!

184
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,118
This is whyl had to
rewrite our wedding vows.

185
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,590
We're here to pick up an order
for Comic Center.

186
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:46,795
Sure. Let me go check on that.

187
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,752
Dude, I thinkthat's Nathan Fillion.

188
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:53,870
Oh, yeah, look at that.

189
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:58,032
And he's picking the tomatoes
out of his salad just like I do.

190
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,951
I always did feel a connection with him.

191
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,596
Oh, I have got an idea.

192
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:06,353
We're not selling his tomatoes on eBay.

193
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:10,355
No, if we got Captain Reynolds
from Fireﬂy...

194
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:13,875
...to do a signing at Stuart's store,
that would be amazing.

195
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:16,758
-That would be great.
-Should we go talk to him?

196
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,271
I don't know. If he's not nice...

197
00:11:19,439 --> 00:11:22,829
...it's gonna make it hard for me
to watch him in anything again.

198
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:27,117
The guy who plays Jon Snow was ajerk.
We still watch Game of Thrones.

199
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,554
He was ajerk because you rear-ended him.

201
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,635
It's odd seeing a member of the Night's
Watch with a kayak strapped to his car.

202
00:11:37,719 --> 00:11:39,232
Come on.

203
00:11:43,239 --> 00:11:46,629
Hi, excuse me. Don't mean to bother you,
but we're just really--

204

We're big fans of Fireﬂy. And Dr. Horrible.

205
00:11:49,999 --> 00:11:52,911
Oh, I think you made a mistake.
I'm not an actor.

206
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,993
Don't say that.

207
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:58,674
I mean, you're not Dame Judi Dench,
but you're pretty great.

208
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,556
I get it. You think I'm Nathan Fillion...

209
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,156

I would just love to eat my lunch.

00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:13,230
Don't know why he's so grumpy.

212
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,359
I got mistaken for that guy
in Life ofPi once, I'm still floating.

Uh, hey, did you see that?

215
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,070
I figured out how to open
the door all by myself.

216
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:35,435
Maybe I'll fling some feces around my cage
to celebrate.

And you're eating alone at a deli?

236

I swear by my pretty floral bonnet,
I will end you.

245

That's it. That's the line.

00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:12,838

-I want a picture with Nathan Fillion.

who looks like Nathan Fillion...

249
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,153

than Nathan Fillion usually is?

At one point, they had me figure out
how to get a banana out of a puzzle box.

Wait. Sheldon gave me a banana in a box.
He was testing me too.

256
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,719
Unbelievable.

257
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:56,916

That was impossible.

So you guys were testing us both?
What is the matter with you?

261
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:13,395
The matter is they think they're so smart
they don't care if they hurt others' feelings.
