a few questions about the theory.

just got mentioned in Scientiﬁc American.

30
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:29,751
But it wasn't my fault.

31

I didn't exclude him,
and I didn't write the article.

32

-No. No, they loved it.

he was just as important.

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,188
Also, Wolowitz invited us all to dinner.

171
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,509
So...

172
00:09:15,319 --> 00:09:17,435
...l'm ready whenever you are.

173
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,274
-All he had was an idea.
-Well, that is an important part.

174
00:09:27,439 --> 00:09:30,715
Oh, please. I have ideas all day long.

175
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,871
Reverse SeaWorld,
where dolphins are allowed to pet people.

176
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,433
A new clothing size
between medium and large, called "marge."

177
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,274
Snow White retold
from the point of view of Sneezy.

178
00:09:43,439 --> 00:09:46,795
Why won't Doc prescribe him something?
We finally find out.

179
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,312
But Leonard's idea was good.

180
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,436
Fine, then Grumpy,
what's he so grumpy about?

181
00:09:54,599 --> 00:09:56,829
Maybe his girlfriend won't take his side.

182
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,796
I'm the one who thought of it.

183
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,950
Well, didn't he do a lot of the work?

184
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,671
But now he's happy to let people think
he's responsible for everything.

185
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,513
And that's why you get an iPad helicopter.

186
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,516
Is it my fault I have a much bigger reputation
than he does?

187
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,715
It's not your fault.

188
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:20,076
Is it my fault that my name came first
on the paper alphabetically?

189
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,275
Not your fault.

190
00:10:21,439 --> 00:10:25,955
Is it my fault that when the reporter cited me
as the lead scientist, I didn't correct him?

191
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,473
Hey, look at that pretty bird.

192
00:10:29,319 --> 00:10:31,913
He always needs all the attention.
He's such a baby.

193
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,513
I know, I know.

194
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,750
He is never, ever playing with my helicopter.

195
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,512
Okay, I'll start heating some of this stuff up.

196
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,875
-Thanks.
-Oh, man.

197
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,750
This is the boutonniere
from my high school prom. Heh-heh.

198
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,957
A piece of cake from my Bar Mitzvah.

199
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:56,074
-Did she throw anything away?
-No.

200
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,073
If I find my foreskin, I'm gonna kill myself.

201
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,113
Okay, so we've got, um, three briskets...

202
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,918
...four meat loafs, one lasagna--

203
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,672
No, that's noodle kugel.

204
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,512
One Jewish lasagna...

205
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,758
...two pound cakes
that are about 8 pounds each...

206
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,356
...and one giant container
of matzo ball soup.

207
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:23,593
Ma always kept it on hand in case I got sick.

208
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:29,195
She thought she could cure anything
with her cooking.

209
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,636
Even the time I got food poisoning.

210
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,598
From her cooking.

211
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,157
You okay?

212
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,119
Yeah, I'm okay.

213
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,155
-Let's get started.
-You got it.

214
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:52,712
I'm never gonna talk to her again.

215
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,669
[HOWARD EXHALES]

216
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,558
Should we tell everyone not to come?

217
00:12:02,719 --> 00:12:05,517
No, I wanna do this.

218
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,349
Okay. Well, I'll keep it together if you can.

219
00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:10,474
Okay. Heh.

220
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,670
I'm not making any promises.

221
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,355
-Glad you guys could make it.
-Of course.

222
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,872
Looks really pretty in here.

223
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,032
Yeah. Turns out half a dozen menorahs
really sets a mood.

224
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,158
Have you thought about what you'd do
if Howard sells the house?

225
00:12:29,319 --> 00:12:31,230
And there goes the mood.

226
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,272
Hi. Hello.

227
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,753
Oh, and a special hello to Leonard,
who needs to be mentioned by name.

228
00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:41,469
-Subtle.
-Yeah, but you got it, right?

229
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,796
-Hey, guys.
AMY: Hi.

230
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,953
I just want everyone to know, uh,
tonight's not a sad occasion.

231
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,192
We just wanna have the kind of dinner
we've all had here so many times before.

232
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,079
Good food, good friends,
and sometime around midnight...

233
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,470
...heartburn that makes you pray for death.

234
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,236
-Need any help in the kitchen?
-No, we got it.

235
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:03,878
Make yourselves comfortable.

236
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,432
All right, hey, you two,
we're here for Howard right now, okay?

237
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,636
-Yes, so please behave yourselves.
-Fine.

238
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,028
Of course.

239
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,678
So I heard you two wrote a paper together.
How's that going?

240
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,552
This food is amazing.

241
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,950
And not a vegetable in sight.

242
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,509
That's not true.
We've got tomatoes right here.

243
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:35,316
All these bright people
sitting around a table by candlelight...

244
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,392
...feels like we could be
in an 18th-century French salon.

245
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,754
Indeed.

246
00:13:40,439 --> 00:13:44,671
Penny, a salon is a gathering
where intellectuals entertained each other...

247
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:46,397
...with sparkling conversations...

248
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,154
-...about issues of the day.
-Oh, so it's like The View.

249
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,708
Sheldon, The View is a daytime talk show
hosted by women.

250
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,280
Oh, I'm aware.
It features Whoopi Goldberg.

251
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,634
She played Guinan on Star Trek: Next Gen.

252
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,558
-Penny, Next Gen refers to Star Trek--
-Shut up.

253
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,513
I would like to propose a salon topic.

254
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,079
Ooh, please do, Rajesh.

255
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,071
The lead in The Hunger Games is a woman.

256
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,071
Marvel has made Thor a female.

257
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:18,031
Wait, who's "Tor"?

258
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,790
You know, Thor, the god of thunder.

259
00:14:23,439 --> 00:14:26,476
As I was saying, is this a sign
that our society...

260
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,675
...is approaching gender equality?

261
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,953
Certainly a lot more women
are reading comic books now.

262
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,954
It's true. At the store,
I had to put a seat on the toilet.

263
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,072
We won't know if there's equality
until female Thor has a baby...

264
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,198
...and the Avengers are cool
with her pumping breast milk at work.

265
00:14:44,439 --> 00:14:48,034
I wonder if only a baby who is worthy
can suckle at the bosom of Thor. Heh.

266
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,394
Okay, new salon topic.

267
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,630
Salons: dumb thing from a long time ago...

268
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,713
...or interesting thing made dumb
by talking about superheroes? Discuss.

269
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,716
I don't believe it matters what the topic is.

270
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:03,951
What's crucial for a salon
is that we conduct the discussion...

271
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,350
...in an elevated and insightful way.

272
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:08,237
It's all about the execution.

273
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,711
Of course you'd focus on that,
rather than the inspiration.

274
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:16,111
Uh, new salon topic: What's more important,
an idea or its execution?

275
00:15:16,599 --> 00:15:17,634
Oh, that's fun.

276
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,678
Yeah, good for you, Leonard.
That's a lovely little notion.

277
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,355
Kind of like, "I wish I could talk
to my uncle in Chicago."

278
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:27,352
Yeah, now stand back
while I invent the telephone.

279
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,111
Hello? Oh, hold on.

280
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,477
Leonard, it's your uncle.
He says you just got burned.

281
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,797
-Sheldon.
-No, it's okay.

282
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:38,712
We're all adults trying to have
an intelligent discussion.

283
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:40,870
At least I am. Howard, what do you think?

284
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,312
Well, I guess, as an engineer,
I lean towards execution.

285
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,195
I spend my days trying to take ideas
and make them real.

286
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,272
Well said, old chap.

287
00:15:51,439 --> 00:15:54,033
I thought eloquence had died,
here it stands before us.

288
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:58,556
Starting today, it will go: Gettysburg Address,
"I have a dream," and what you just said.

289

Oh, now he's a genius? All you ever do
is make fun of him and engineering.

Leonard, please. His motherjust died.

291
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,156
-You're being ridiculous.
-Yeah, so are you.

292
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:11,516
Guys, if I wanted to hear people be bitchy,
I'd go to my real salon.

293
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,477
Lots of people could've had that idea.

294
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,598
But very few people could've worked out
the math the way I did.

295
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:18,795
Lots of people also didn't have that idea.

296
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,712
-Like everyone in the entire world except me.
SHELDON: Oh.

297
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:25,315
Well, apparently Leonard thinks he's better
than everyone in the whole world.

-You already ruined Thor. Give it a rest.

with you hogging all the credit?
