Leonard, I've been working on an opening joke
for our lecture at Berkeley.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,398
Ooh, I like to laugh, but say it anyway.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,271
Okay. Uh....

4
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:17,432
"What do you say to a graduate
of the UC Berkeley Physics Department?"

5
00:00:17,759 --> 00:00:19,715
"I'll have fries with that." Heh.

6
00:00:20,999 --> 00:00:25,277
Because his education hasn't prepared him
for a career in the sciences.

7
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:29,716
When they chase you out of there,
you have to run faster than Sheldon.

8

-Are you all set for your trip?
-Yeah, I think so.

9

Yeah, ljust restocked the old PRK.

-PRK?
-Public restroom kit.

in new and strange places.

backpack with your own toilet paper and Purell.

Oh, danger whistle.

Um.... Pepper spray.

Ooh, a multi-language "occupied" sign.

uh, booties for my shoes...

next to me isn't some kind of weirdo.

the danger whistle?

...but the added fun of subatomic particles
and waves outside the visible spectrum.

If 65 billion solar neutrinos pass
through a square centimeter every second...

37
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,834
...given the surface area of this car
is about 60,000 square centimeters...

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,152
...that means 3.9 times 10

-Sure.

I had a table too, but I didn't have any friends,
so all I did was serve.

74

Yes.

Do you think this song is the music

79
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:13,156
It could be.

80
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:16,630
So it's like the musical equivalent
of Russell's paradox.

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,155
The question of whether the set of all sets...

00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,632
I think what really needs to be rescued is
your sense of whimsy, but one quest at a time.

167
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,358
So, what's the plan?

168
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,516
I'm just gonna be honest with the guy.

169
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,631
Honesty will never get us in.

170
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:46,318
Well, what's your plan?

171
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:49,477
All right, my plan
is predicated on the assumption...

172
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,318
...that they have a nurse's office...

173
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,273
...and your willingness to be lightly stabbed.

174
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,754
-Who are you here to see?
-l'm gonna tell you the truth.

175
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,030
Oh, you are killing me.

176
00:11:07,439 --> 00:11:11,034
We don't have an appointment.
We're just fans of Mr. Lucas' work.

177
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,232
We thought we'd take a shot,
see if we could get in and look around.

178
00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:16,714
5°"V. guys, we get this a lot.
I can't let you in.

179
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,276
What if I told you
that l was the voice of Yoda?

180
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,276
A recording session, I must attend.

181
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,519
I'm sorry. Don't listen to him.
We're actually physicists.

182
00:11:29,719 --> 00:11:33,507
We're giving a lecture at Berkeley later today.
We just-- We had some time to kill.

183
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,551
Hey, listen, you seem like decent guys.

184
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:38,717
I can't let you in,
but I've got hats and T-shirts I can give you.

185
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,069
Thank you so much.

186
00:11:41,319 --> 00:11:42,638
See?

187
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,751
Maybe honesty is the--
What are you doing?

188
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,954
Shedding the yoke of my oppressors,
you blind, sad little man.

189
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,149
Don't move.

190
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,555
Code A-A 23. A-A 23.

191
00:11:52,759 --> 00:11:53,874
MAN [OVER RADIO]:
Copy.

192
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,751
SHELDON:
I can see the ranch, Leonard.

193
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:58,189
Oh, it's rustic, it's lovely.

194
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,790
I'd take a picture,
but people are chasing me.

195
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,914
I'm gonna make it. I'm gonna make it.

196
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,795
They have Tasers,
but they wouldn't dare use-- Aah!

197
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:13,597
Come on, Raj.

198
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,076
You are the King Kong of Ping-Pong.

199
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,590
You are the menace of table tennis.

200
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,672
Put her away
because I don't have a third one.

201
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,311
Yes! Whoo!

202
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,671
Rajesh: 8, Penny: 4.

203
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:30,790
Sorry, he's really good.

204
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,392
Hey, Raj, if Howard can't keep the TARDIS,
how great would it look at your place?

205
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,716
-What?
-Yeah, what?

206
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,916
I don't know much about Doctor Who
but if, um...

207
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:43,547
...you were to put this right outside
your front door...

208
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:46,034
...and open up the back...

209
00:12:46,239 --> 00:12:50,357
...it would be like your entire apartment
was the inside of the TARDIS.

210
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,910
Which is pretty cool, because on the show...

211
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,829
...the inside of the TARDIS
is bigger than the outside.

212
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:01,273
But then again,
I don't know much about Doctor Who.

213
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,871
Don't listen to her.
You and I go way back. We're like brothers.

214
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,877
We are. We are. Ahem.

215
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,917
Oh, no, what a terrible serve.

216
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,514
Sorry, brother.

217
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,188
-Eight-five.
-This is ridiculous. I want a new champion.

218
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,515
Amy, were you serious
about being able to serve?

219
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,280
Oh, it's been a long time.

220
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,472
I don't know. I'm probably pretty rusty.

221
00:13:32,439 --> 00:13:35,397
-She's my champion.
-Well, if you can switch champions, so can I.

222
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,589
-I want Raj.
-Hey.

223
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,313
Oh, come on, like you even care.

224
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,589
Well, I care.

225
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,870
Oh, wait, no, I don't. Good luck, Raj.

226
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:47,912
-I thought our friendship meant more to you.
-So did I.

227
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,275
-Do you think they're gonna call the police?
-I don't know.

228
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:04,748
Maybe they'll call Imperial officers
to take us to a holding cell on the Death Star.

229
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,950
Oh, I think that's below the pay grade
of an Imperial officer.

230
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:12,474
-Stormtroopers are really the ones--
-Oh, shut up.

231
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,398
He's right.

232
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,310
Stormtroopers actually combine both
the function of infantry and military police. Heh.

233
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,951
Uh-huh. I'm normally very nice,
but you shut up too.

234
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,751
So, what are you in for?

235
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,755
Honestly, I just wanted to meet Mr. Lucas
and say thank you.

236
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:42,553
Growing up, the movies
had such an impact on my life.

237
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:47,078
I never really fit in anywhere
till I discovered the worlds he created...

238
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,271
...and finally found a place where I belong.

239
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,593
But why are you here?

240
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:54,114
Oh, I hopped afence...

241
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:57,988
...and they caught me in the sculpture gallery
making out with a Chewbacca statue.

242
00:15:04,439 --> 00:15:05,554
Excuse me.

243
00:15:13,719 --> 00:15:15,277
Leonard.

244
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:17,517
They have a sculpture gallery.

245
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:25,031
I talked to my supervisor
and we're gonna let you go with a warning.

246
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,233
But if you come back,
we'll call the police and press charges.

247
00:15:28,439 --> 00:15:30,157
We understand. Thank you so much.

248
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:33,909
-Uh, what about me?
-You're not going anywhere, kissy face.

249
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:37,669
Let's go. I have to take your picture,
post it at the guard gate.

250
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:41,474
Uh, one question about that picture:
Can it be with George Lucas?

251
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,119
Ooh. Grumpy, you are.

252
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,872
Okay, this is the match that decides it all.

253
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:54,194
First to 11 wins.

254
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,518
Serve switches every five points.
And just so you know, when this started...

255
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,148
...l was going to put the TARDIS
in a discreet corner...

256
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:04,117
...but now it's going
right in the middle of the living room...

257
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:07,510
...on a rotating platform
with a sign that says "Suck it." Game on.

258
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,472
Except Raj is gonna win.

259
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,954
Isn't that right, Raj?

260
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,151
Yeah, I mean, her serve was pretty good.

261
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,749
Come on, get in her head. Be intimidating.

262
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,474
Okay.

263
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,874
I'm gonna own you, bitch.

264
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,308
-Raj.
-Hey.

265
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,714
That's not nice.

266
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,478
Let's just play.

267
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,750
One-zero. Two.

268
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,956
Three. Four.

269
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,439
Five-nothing.

270
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:43,478
Ha, ha. Wait, did you play badminton
or sadminton?

271
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:49,709
Don't listen to him. All she's got is a serve.
Now, grab a fresh tampon and put her away.

272
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,112
Wha--? And that's not offensive?
Where's the line?

273
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:55,037
It's in your purse. Play.

274
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,228
BERNADETTE:
One-five.

275
00:16:59,999 --> 00:17:02,433
Two-five. Three-five.

276
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:04,308
Four-five.

277
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,032
Five-five.

278
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,476
Six. Seven.

279
00:17:11,159 --> 00:17:13,309
Eight. Nine.

280
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:15,554
Ten-five.

281
00:17:18,479 --> 00:17:19,468
Six.

282
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:21,668
Seven.

283
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:25,035
Eight. Nine.

284
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:27,952
Ten-ten.

285
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:33,749
That was an exciting 40 seconds.

286
00:17:35,199 --> 00:17:38,714
It was, and now the serve is back to you
and the game is over.

287
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,756
You know, Amy, I can't help but wonder...

288
00:17:43,959 --> 00:17:46,792
...how Sheldon would react
if the TARDIS was at your place.

289
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:52,157
-Don't listen to her, just hit the ball.
-Keep talking.

290
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,830
If this doesn't get him into your bedroom,
nothing will.

291
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,431
-Are you still mad at me?
-Yes.

292
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,834
We missed our lecture...

293
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:12,792
...we were almost arrested,
and you got me locked in a room...

294
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,788
...with a man who forced his tongue
down the throat of a stuffed Wookiee.

295
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,312
Boy, some people are just glass half-empty.

296
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,875
The glass is empty, Sheldon.
It's completely empty.

297
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:28,038
If you gave that glass to a man who was dying
of thirst, he would be dead. You know why?

298
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,834
Before I answer, was he a smoker?

299
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,510
I think you're looking at this all wrong.

300
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,950
Fine, then tell me
howl should be looking at it.

301
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:44,198
Well, not only did we go
to Skywalker Ranch, we got in.

302
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,391
And no one we know can say that.

303
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:49,477
And for all the times you find me irritating...

304
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,592
...today you got to watch someone
shoot me with a Taser.

305
00:18:56,159 --> 00:18:58,389
That part was pretty good.

306
00:18:58,719 --> 00:19:00,038
See?

307
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,829
You did flop around a lot.

308
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:07,873
I'll take your word for it,
I was too busy trying not to defecate.

309
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,714
You know, when they were escorting us
to the detaining room...

310
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,036
...I looked through a door
and I'm pretty sure I saw a display case...

311
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,912
...with the Ark of the Covenant. Ha, ha.

312
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,798
That's amazing.

313
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,310
And I saw Jabba the Hutt
riding on a motorcycle.

314
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,391
Although that was right after the Tasing,
so who can say for sure.

315
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,592
I guess this could count as an adventure.

316
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:33,788
It was.

317
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,437
And even though we're not allowed back there,
they can never take today away from us.

318
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,513
Unlike my sense of smell,
which hasn't returned since the Tasing.

319
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,513
No, I got nothing.

320
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,998
Amy, the Daleks are right on my tail.

321
00:19:57,199 --> 00:19:59,076
Quick, we need to reset the time circuits.

322
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:03,029
Oh, no, I left my sonic screwdriver behind.

323
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,910
I really should have thought this through.

324
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:37,070
