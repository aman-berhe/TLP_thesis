1
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:04,633
-You're wrong.
-No, I'm not.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,950
-Yes, you are.
-No, I'm not.

3
00:00:07,159 --> 00:00:11,391
Settle this. Those little animated pictures on
the Internet. Are they called gifs or "jifs"?

4
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:14,756
Well, the 6 stands for "graphic,"
so that's a hard 6, so I'd say gif.

5
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:20,869
-The guy who invented it says it's "jif."
-Do you mean the guy or the "juy"?

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,073
Well, I'll give you three guesses
why I'm so irritated.

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,437
Something happened different
from the way you wanted it.

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,233
I guess news travels fast.

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,990
It's true. A select group of scientists
was invited to a weekend symposium...

10
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:39,992
...at a former home of Richard Feynman,
and lwasn't included.

11
00:00:40,159 --> 00:00:44,471
Oh. Sheldon, I'm sure it's not because
they don't think you're an elite scientist.

12
00:00:44,639 --> 00:00:47,836
Yeah, I bet you anything
it's just because you're a pain in the ass.

13
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,869
You're just saying that
to make me feel better.

14
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:54,269
You can spend the rest of the day
being bitter--

15
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,998
Ag reed.

16
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,473
l was gonna say "or," but why bother?

17
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,475
-Hey, Raj.
-Hey. I got you a little gift.

18
00:01:28,639 --> 00:01:30,789
Wow, that's a lot of Girl Scout cookies.

19
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,555
You know me. I'm from India.
I can't resist children begging.

20
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,713
-How's it going with the title to the house?
-Great. It's done.

21
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:41,439
The lawyer tracked down my father,
got him to sign it over.

22
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,070
I didn't have to meet him, didn't have
to talk to him. I don't even know where he is.

23
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,471
-Wow. So you're not curious at all?
-Nope.

24
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,073
Huh. What if he's in prison?

25
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:54,394
What if he's a spy?
What if he's in a Beatles cover band?

26
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,989
I'm just saying,
if he's got your nose and haircut...

27
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,672
...he'd make a killer Ringo.

28
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,994
-Thanks for agreeing to do this.
-Cool. I've never been on a podcast before.

29
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:09,191
Well, you picked a good one to start.
Wil's had lots of great guests.

30
00:02:09,359 --> 00:02:13,147
Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner,
Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden.

31
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,153
-Those are Star Trek people.
-Yes.

32
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,470
I only figured that out
because I'd never heard of any of them. Heh.

33
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,028
l deserved that.
I invited you on my show and I drove here.

34
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,269
Sorry.

35
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:27,873
Okay, so this is basically
just like a little talk show.

36
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,079
We're gonna take some calls, talk about
what it was like on the set of Serial Ape-is! 2.

37
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,151
-It should be really fun.
-This is exciting.

38
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,833
Yeah. So how many people listen?

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,037
Most people download it later,
but usually a few thousand listen live.

40
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,239
What? A few thousand people listen
to you talk about nerd stuff?

41
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:48,469
Again, right in the ears,
straight to the feelings.

42
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,750
Can you please pass the salt?

43
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,477
Sure. Not like I was invited
to Richard Feynman's house...

44
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,870
...and have anything better to do.

45
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:04,758
-Is this how the rest of the night's gonna be?
-I don't know the future.

46
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,791
Do you think there's a chance
that an asteroid could hit the Earth...

47
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,270
...destroying Feynman's house
and everyone in it?

48
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,309
No, Sheldon.

49
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,517
Well, then, buckle up.
You're in for a cranky night.

50
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,474
According to the codicil
of the relationship agreement...

51
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:25,268
...which you insisted on, we're not allowed
to pout or be moody on date night.

52
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,796
You know I just put that in
because of uterus stuff.

53
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,592
Well, it applies to you too.

54
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:36,351
l was afraid you might bring this up...

55
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:39,358
...so I have a work-around.

56
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,832
There you go.

57
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:52,636
As far as you're concerned, I'm smiling.

58
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,035
Though I admit I'm smiling a little
at the moment...

59
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,270
...because this loophole is so brilliant.

60
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,478
So, Bernadette, have you thought about
how you're going to redecorate this place?

61
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:07,358
You know, I'm thinking,
ripping up the carpets...

62
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,988
...maybe lose the wallpaper,
all new light fixtures.

63
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,596
You know, if you knocked out this wall,
it would give you an open floor plan.

64
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,514
And then--
It's a little scary but could be fun.

65
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,154
--indoor fire pit.

66
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:21,909
[DOORBELL RINGS]

67
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,718
Hey, I grew up in this house, okay?
No one's knocking anything down.

68
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:28,198
Okay, okay.

69
00:04:28,359 --> 00:04:31,669
When he's at Comic-Con,
I'm bringing in awrecking ball.

70
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:37,757
-Can I help you?
-Hi, are you Howard Wolowitz?

71
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,238
Yes.

72
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,710
Um, this is a little weird.
A lawyer was trying to contact my father...

73
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,439
...because his name was still on the title
for this house.

74
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,751
Well-- Who's your father?

75
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,597
Sam Wolowitz.

76
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,228
Oh.

77
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,278
-Sam Wolowitz is my father.
-I know.

78
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,037
Well, wait. So if we have the same father....

79
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,151
I mean, are you saying
you're my half-brother?

80
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,914
lthink so.

81
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:07,879
Bernadette, weird things are happening
out here.

82
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,918
I think I started to suspect
it was a bad movie...

83
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,595
...when I looked at the script
and saw the title...

84
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,238
...Serial Ape-is! 2: Monkey See, Monkey Kill.

85
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,156
Spoiler alert: After the monkey sees, it kills.

86
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,233
Psst.

87
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,150
I've just been handed a note.
I'm going to read it.

88
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:35,197
"Wil, do you want more Diet Coke?

89
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,028
Also, we have juice."

90
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:42,869
I didn't wanna interrupt.

91
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,596
That voice you just heard belongs
to Leonard, Penny's fiancé.

92
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,115
-Will you grab headphones and join us?
-Really?

93
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,599
WIL: Yeah.
-That'd be great.

94
00:05:51,799 --> 00:05:55,235
All right, so while Leonard gets set up,
let's take a call.

95
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,075
Hello, caller. You are on with Penny and Wil
from Serial Ape-is! 2.

96
00:05:59,239 --> 00:06:02,709
WOMAN : I don't have a question.
I just wanna say I'm a big fan of the movie.

97
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,869
I've seen it like 10 times.

98
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:08,351
Okay, well, I'll apologize for the first time,
but the other nine are on you.

99
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,629
Thanks, caller. You know the movie
actually has a little bit of a cult following?

100
00:06:13,799 --> 00:06:16,313
-Really?
-I was at a science-fiction convention...

101
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,199
...and I saw a woman dressed
as your half-ape character.

102
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:22,396
Oh, if she was with an Indian guy
dressed like a banana...

103
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:25,119
...that was just my friends Howard and Raj.

104
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,791
It's time for a very special guest caller.

105
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:32,508
A friend of mine you probably know
as the director of such movies as Clerks...

106
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:36,957
...or from podcasts and books where he
reminds you he directed Clerks.

107
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:38,268
Hello, Kevin Smith.

108
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,873
KEVIN SMITH [OVER PHONE]:
Hey, man, yo. Is everything okay, Wil?

109
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,750
Because it's been like two minutes and
you haven't even brought up Stand by Me.

110
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,388
-Hey, Kevin, it's exciting to talk to you.
-Yeah, it really is.

111
00:06:50,559 --> 00:06:53,471
Oh, you guys are very sweet.
So, Penny, listen. I saw your movie.

112
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:55,550
Oh, wow, I wish it was better.

113
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,518
Oh, don't worry about it.
Have you seen some of Kevin's films?

114
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:01,953
You're cruising for a beating, Wheaton.

115
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:07,354
Anyway, man, I dug the ape movie, Penny.
Andl thought you were really great in it.

116
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,237
-Aw.
-You know, I'm in the movie too.

117
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,992
Yeah, whatever. Penny....

118
00:07:12,239 --> 00:07:15,515
Penny, how come you're not in more stuﬁ?
I'd cast you in a minute.

119
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,113
-Seriously?
-Oh, yeah, man.

120
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,635
I'm actually in preproduction
on a movie right now...

121
00:07:19,799 --> 00:07:23,678
...way diﬁ'erent than anything
I've ever done before. It's called Clerks 3.

122
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:28,954
-You should come over and read for a part.
-Oh, my-- I would love that.

123
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:31,838
-You have a newjob.
-Well, maybe I could do both.

124
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,231
I don't think you can do both.

125
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,469
I don't think I asked you.

126
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,074
Yeah, you tell him, Penny.

127
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:42,228
Stay out of it, Kevin Smith.

128
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,830
Do you think there comes a time when
it stops feeling bad to be left out of things?

129
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,633
Probably not.

130
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:54,275
It's an evolutionary advantage
to be included in group activities.

131
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,634
You know what?
I used to be a fan of evolution...

132
00:07:57,799 --> 00:08:01,678
...but I've since evolved,
and now I think it's dumb.

133
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,555
Being left out is a terrible feeling.
No one understands that better than I do.

134
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,713
Hey, look at that.

135
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,110
Even in your example,
you're all by yourself.

136
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,949
When there was a lice epidemic
at my school, everybody got it except me.

137
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,910
I tried to fool everyone by sprinkling sugar
in my hair, but I just got attacked by bees.

138
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,957
I can just picture them all right now
at Feynman's house.

139
00:08:27,359 --> 00:08:29,270
Probably discussing Schrodinger...

140
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,317
...and at the same time,
not discussing Schrodinger.

141
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,591
See? They're missing out
on hilariousjokes like that.

142
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:40,193
And at the same time, not.

143
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,314
Reminds me of when my stupid brother and
sister would build forts in the living room...

144
00:08:45,479 --> 00:08:48,949
...and wouldn't let me in.
I hated that so much.

145
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,148
You know, there's nothing I can do
about getting you invited to the symposium.

146
00:08:54,319 --> 00:08:56,355
But if you wanted...

147
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,747
...we could build a fort.

148
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,677
Isn't that a little juvenile?

149
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,554
More juvenile than this?

150
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,030
I'll get the blankets,
you Google how to have childlike fun.

151
00:09:12,439 --> 00:09:15,192
You know, I'm being a bad host.
Let me get some more coffee.

152
00:09:15,359 --> 00:09:17,270
-Oh, let me do it, Howard.
-No, I got it.

153
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,192
So, Josh, what do you do?

154
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,396
I'm studying oceanography
down in San Diego.

155
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,596
Oh, how nice.

156
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,510
I love Finding Nemo.

157
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,150
Enough chitchat. How do we know
you are who you say you are?

158
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:39,517
-Why would I lie?
-Okay, you got me there.

159
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,237
-You here looking for money?
-No.

160
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,595
Kidney? Cornea? Piece of his liver?

161
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,875


162
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,998
You're in a Beatles cover band...

163
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,674
...and you need Howard
to replace your dad as Ringo.

164
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,071
-Why don't you help with the coffee?
-Okay, but something smells fishy.

165
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,198
And notjust because
you work around sea animals.

166
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:04,471
That actually sounds interesting,
and I'd like to learn more about it.

167
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,430
-Hey, you okay?
-Not really.

168
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,434
This guy shows up out of the blue,
and now I have a brother?

169
00:10:13,599 --> 00:10:16,511
My father has another family?

170
00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:19,992
I get it. What do you wanna do?

171
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,516
I don't know, I....
I'd just like him to go away.

172
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,272
I can't deal with this.

173
00:10:25,439 --> 00:10:27,191
All right, I got your back.

174
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,196
Thank you. Come on.

175
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,753
I'd like to point out,
this wall just provided a lot of privacy.

176
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:40,195
I can't believe my brother's an astronaut.
That's amazing. What was it like?

177
00:10:40,359 --> 00:10:44,352
-Listen, dude, it's time for you to hit the--
-Hey. The man asked a good question.

178
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,598
So for those of you just tuning in...

179
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:54,711
...we are listening to a really fun fight
between my co-star--

180
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:57,347
We're not fighting.
We're just having a conversation.

181
00:10:58,439 --> 00:11:01,829
All right. We're listening
to a really fun conversation...

182
00:11:01,999 --> 00:11:05,674
...between my co-star from Serial Ape-ist 2
and her fiancé...

183
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,637
...who doesn't believe
women should have dreams.

184
00:11:11,199 --> 00:11:13,269
Give me back thatjuice.

185
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:17,678
-What is the harm ifl audition?
-Well, what if you get it?

186
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:21,196
I don't know, I make a movie,
we could become rich and famous...

187
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,432
...win an Oscar, Golden Globe,
and live an incredibly wonderful life.

188
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,836
From a Kevin Smith movie?

189

KEVIN SMITH [OVER PHONE]:
Oh, I'm hanging up now.

190
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,314
Don't listen to him. You're awesome. You're
one of the greatest directors of our time.

00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:36,475
I don't have a part for you, Wheaton.

192
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,877
And that was Kevin Smith.

-Thanks a lot.
-l'm just trying to protect you.

194
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:47,554
How many times did you get your heart
broken trying to make it as an actress?

195
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,917
Instead of protecting me, try being excited
when something good happens.

196
00:11:51,079 --> 00:11:52,797
I'm always excited for you.

197
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,191
I'm excited that you found this newjob
where you're making decent money.

198
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,909
-Decent? I make twice what you make.
-Wait, twice?

199
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,479
Yeah.

200
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:04,878
Like, times two? Twice?

201
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:11,115
For you at home, Leonard just found out his
fiancée makes more money than he does.

202
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,476
Let's listen.

203
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:16,153
I went to school for half my life.
I have a doctorate.

204
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:18,913
I'm still paying off college loans.

205
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,833
Well, how much do you owe?
Maybe I can help you out.

206
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,797
Wil, l'm-- Can we just turn off the podcast
for a little bit?

207
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,236
For those of you at home,
lam shaking my head no.

208
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,874
How's it going, Sheldon?

209
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,950
Wonderful.

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,278
-Can I come in?
-Yes. Oh, but enter through the side.

Batman is a load-bearing blanket.

213
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:57,599
-Amazing.
-I know.

214
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:00,637
This isn't the printout. This is my real face.

215
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,917
What are we doing? This is a fort.
Let's sit on the floor.

216
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,435
Roughing it? Okay.

217
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,396
Everything looks so big from down here.

218
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,828
This must be how Leonard feels.

219
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,195
I'm surprised you could hear me
with this Thin Mint in your ear! Ha, ha!

220
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,590
-Yeah, pretty cool, huh?
-Yeah.

221
00:13:31,719 --> 00:13:34,279
Anyway, I should probably get going.

222
00:13:34,719 --> 00:13:38,109
Howie, have you noticed how often
people say that when you start to do magic?

223
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,438
Sorry. I have a long drive.

224
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,160
Well, I hope I get to see you again.

225
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:49,111
I hope so too. I've always dreamed
of having a brother to play catch with.

226
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:51,709
Aw. Keep dreaming.

227
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,830
Hey, I threw the first pitch
at an Angels game.

228
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:58,071
-Wow.
-He did it with a robot.

229
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,759
You had sex with a robot?

230
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,279
-That's not what she meant.
-But technically, yes.

231
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,038
Hang on. If you're making all this money,
where is it?

232
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,588
-In a safe place.
-What does that mean? Under your bed?

233
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,115
No. It means a diversified portfolio
of stocks and bonds.

234
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:21,990
I'm not overly conservative. I'm young. So
my guy said I can afford to take some risks.

235
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,755
-Wait a minute. You have a guy?
-Don't you have a guy?

236
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:28,752
Why would I have a guy?
I don't have any money.

237
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:33,116
Oh, sweetie,
you should really get some money.

238
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:38,155
For those of you listening at home,
how great is this?

239
00:14:38,359 --> 00:14:40,793
Wil, I'm begging you,
just please turn that off.

240
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,552
Sure.

241
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,352
And we're back.

242
00:14:46,439 --> 00:14:48,509
Why are you making
such a big deal out of this?

243
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,069
So our roles changed a bit
over the last couple years.

244
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,550
This is the way life is.
And I'm sure in time they'll change again.

245
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,747
Great. You're not only
more successful than me...

246
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,717
...now you're more mature.

247
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:03,674
Okay, look. Would it make you feel better
ifl did something dumb...

248
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,515
...like sneak out of work one day
to go audition for a Kevin Smith movie?

249
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:09,590
That would be great. Thank you.

250
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,795
I'm just gonnajump in here real quick.
Leonard, a moment ago you were dead set...

251
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,110
...against Penny resuming her acting career,
but now you're all for it.

252
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,272
Is it fair to say
that she played you like a violin?

253
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,637
Yes, it is, Wil.

254
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,755
So I have to ask.

255
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,638
Was the robot sexy?

256
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,155
It was actuallyjust a mechanical hand.

257
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:39,194
Because that's all you need, right?

Best Fort Ever Contest or fort-off...

...are Fort Knox, Fort Ticonderoga,
Fort Sumter...

261
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:58,876
...and Fort Cozy McBlanket.

262
00:16:00,479 --> 00:16:04,518
I'd say Knox over Ticonderoga,
because it's got the gold...

263
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,591
-Mm-hm.
-...and McBlanket over Sumter...

264
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:08,829

-Date night's over.
-No. We haven't picked a winner.

We both know this one's gonna win.

Well, of course we do.

Fort Knox doesn't have
a secret physics lending library.

-Come on. I'll help you take this down.
-Wait. What if, just this once...

273
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:36,470
...we suspend the date-night parameters
and you stay later?

274
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:41,550
Well, as long as we're suspending
the parameters...

275
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:46,478
...I could stay really late,
and we could have our first sleepover.

Do you need to borrow a toothbrush
or pajamas?

283
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,479
Would it alarm you to know
that I hid those things here two years ago...

...just in case this ever came up?

It would, but you know how much
I admire preparedness.

we'd be in the living room?
