1
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,907
Would you like to hear some songs
I've rewritten...

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,355
...to get children interested
in the hard sciences?

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:09,747
-Sure.
-Really?

4
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:14,470
Yeah, well, I like music. I like science.
I like making fun of Sheldon. Hit it.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,870
[SINGING]
There was a scientist who had a theory

6
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:19,677
And James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o

7
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:21,477
J-A-M-E-S

8
00:00:21,639 --> 00:00:23,357
C-L-E-R-K

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,475
Space M-A-X-W-E-L-L

10
00:00:25,639 --> 00:00:27,834
And James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o

11
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,759
There was a scientist who had a theory
And James Clerk Maxwell was his name-o

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,909
A-M-E-S

13
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,230
Okay, okay. We get it.

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,271
Perhaps you'd prefer this one.

15
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:42,233
[SINGING]
The itsy bitsy spider is not an insect at all

16
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,277
Because it has eight legs
And two body pans

17
00:00:48,639 --> 00:00:50,470
-That's pretty cool, Sheldon.
-Thank you.

18
00:00:50,919 --> 00:00:54,594
Do either of you know Beyoncé?
I'd love her to get behind it.

19
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,758
-Hey.
-Hey.

20
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,912
You know the new Discovery class missions
NASA's been working on?

21
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,350
-Yeah.
-They're looking to include a message...

22
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:06,477
...from Earth in case one of them
is encountered by alien life.

23
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,754
When I encountered alien life, I discovered
that the key thing was not to sit in its spot.

24
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:15,394
You can't breathe our air
without an inhaler...

25
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,233
...he's allergic to Earth nuts,
but I'm the alien.

26
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,749
Anyway, I'm among a handful of scientists
that have been asked...

27
00:01:22,919 --> 00:01:26,150
...to submit a design proposal
for the message and its delivery system.

28
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,032
-Excellent.
-Congratulations.

29
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,909
And I was wondering if any of you guys
would like to help me do it.

30
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:33,108
Are you kidding? Yes.

31
00:01:33,279 --> 00:01:35,998
-What did you have in mind?
-l'll tell you what you should do.

32
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,754
Avoid the presumption
of the Terran sensory input paradigm.

33
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:41,718
Absolutely. You need a device capable
of delivering info...

34
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:43,995
...across a wide range
of perceptual modalities.

35
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,390
Any intelligent organism
would at the very least...

36
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,438
...need the ability to locate
the position of objects in space.

37
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:52,477
So the ideal interstellar lingua franca
would be haptic.

38
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,996
How about a 3D tactile communicator
rigged for cross-sensory transposition?

39
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,073
Exactly what I expected. Two people forcing
their ideas on me, and only one gentleman...

40
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:03,117
...who bothered to ask me
what my thoughts were. You two are out.

41
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,430
Congratulations, Leonard.
You're on the team.

42
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,390
My mommy raised a gentleman.

43
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:37,438
-Hey, thanks for coming by.
-Yeah, I'm excited to help.

44
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,956
I would've included the others, but
you know exactly what would've happened.

45
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,680
They would've taken over the project
and bossed us around.

46
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,753
I get it. Just this morning, Sheldon wouldn't
let me put almond milk on my Grape-Nuts...

47
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:50,877
...because he said
it was a theoretical nut conflict.

48
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,115
You should've told him
to mind his own business.

49
00:02:54,279 --> 00:02:58,192
That's better than what I did say, which was,
"Fine, I'll eat them with club soda."

50
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,679
What makes them think
they're always in charge of everything?

51
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,193
-They're alpha males.
-Huh.

52
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,352
-What does that make us?
-We could be betas, they're second in charge.

53
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,556
-Okay, sounds good.
-Or we could be omegas.

54
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:11,153
They get pushed around by the alphas
and the betas.

55
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:13,037
Okay, that sounds like us.

56
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,356
Whatever. There's no alphas here,
and this is your project.

57
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,316
You're in charge.
How do you wanna start?

58
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,072
I don't know. How do you wanna start?

59
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,149
I don't know.

60
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,869
Should we call Sheldon and Howard?

61
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,237
-No, we can do this by ourselves.
-Okay, great. How do you wanna start?

62
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,277
I don't know. How do you wanna start?

63
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,512
Sheldon. Sheldon. Sheldon.

64
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,956
I bet that started off as ajoke...

65
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:59,517
...but by the third one you realized there was
something strangely enjoyable about it.

66
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,472
Yeah, I kind of wanna do it again.

67
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:06,836
I don't recommend it.
You'll be doing it the rest of your life.

68
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:10,479
If you're looking for Leonard,
he's with Koothrappali.

69
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:13,233
-No, I actually came to talk to you.
-How nice.

70
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:19,878
Here are some topics that interest me:
quantum mechanics, trains, flags--

71
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,758
No, no, it's about my acting career.

72
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,956
Oh, I'm sorry, that's not on the list.

73
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:25,837
-Well--
-Oh, wait.

74
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,638
How about we split the difference...

75
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,119
...and discuss why Austria was
an archduchy and notjust a regular duchy?

76
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,758
Okay, here's the thing.
I like pharmaceutical sales, it's going great...

77
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:40,116
...butl have an audition for a movie,
and ifl get it, it could screw everything up.

78
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,272
Mm. I know exactly what you should do.

79
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,396
Unfortunately, I cannot tell you.

80
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:48,957
Well, why?

81
00:04:49,119 --> 00:04:50,871
I'm attempting to turn over a new leaf.

82
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:54,827
Earlier today, it was pointed out to me
that I tend to force my ideas on people.

83
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,236
You're really not gonna tell me?

84
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,437
No, that train has left the station.

85
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,875
Now, we can play this one of two ways.

86
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,355
You can say, "Trains? Tell me more."

87
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,076
Or you can just look at me like that
and I'll start.

88
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,748
What's going on in here?

89
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:19,797
lam making molecular cocktails.

90
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:23,838
This sphere is actually a cosmopolitan. Heh.

91
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,513
Oh, how do you drink it?

92
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:28,318
Just put it in your mouth
and pop it like a zit.

93
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,954
I think I'll have a beer.

94
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,237
-First, take a picture with me.
-Why?

95
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:38,711
Well, Raj and I always talked about learning
how to make cocktails like this together.

96
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:40,597
So I taught myself...

97
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:44,394
...and I'm putting this on lnstagram
so he can see it and feel like a turd.

98
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,073
Say, "Cheese."

99
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,229
Is this about the probe
he's working on without you?

100
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,555
You betcha. The very one.

101
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:56,109
Howard, you're a grown man. You guys
don't have to do everything together.

102
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:59,794
I know--
That's why I'm spending tonight with you.

103
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,872
Trying to hurt Raj's feelings.

104
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:03,757
With my honeybunch.

105
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,958
-You're being childish.
-No. He is.

106
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,199
So I have a dominant personality.
We all know that.

107
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:15,269
I'm sorry, what do we know?

108
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:21,593
In social groupings,
ljust naturally wind up in charge.

109
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,548
Don't take this wrong, but how many
of these little booze balls have you had?

110
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,670
-You don't think I'm a leader?
-I was kidding. Of course, you are.

111
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:32,875
Right. I couldn't change if I wanted to.

112
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,833
You'd better not change
because I love who you are.

113
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:40,158
Will you need help cleaning all this up when
you're done, or can you do it all by yourself?

114
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,594
All by myself.

115
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,671
There's my big boss man.

116
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,517
So often, on the front of the locomotive...

117
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:55,389
...is a large iron wedge
for clearing objects off the tracks.

118
00:06:55,559 --> 00:07:01,998
While commonly known as a cow catcher,
I prefer the more accurate "cow exploder."

119
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:06,030
Okay, Sheldon, let me ask you a question.

120
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,117
If I was at a train station...

121
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:10,713
...and one train could take me
to my currentjob...

122
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,553
...and the other could take me
to an audition for a movie...

123
00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:16,187
...which train should I get on?

124
00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:22,792
Are you using trains
to trick me into giving you advice?

125
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:25,031


126
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:27,271
All right, then.

127
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,312
You should take a third train
where you audition for the movie...

128
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,995
...but hold off on making a career decision
until you have more information.

129
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,517
You're right. I'm worried about something
that hasn't even happened yet.

130
00:07:40,679 --> 00:07:43,398
Huh. You are awise man.

131
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:49,517
Well, Penny, who's smarter, the wise man
or the person who comes to him for advice?

132
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,916
Oh, I guess you're right.
Maybe it is the person who asks.

133
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:57,117
No, it's the wise man.

134
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,633
That's why he's called the wise man.

135
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,798
Know howl know that?

136
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:08,189
I'm the wise man.

137
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,634
I'm sorry. What was I thinking?

138
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:15,587
Just out of curiosity, why didn't you
ask Leonard for advice about this?

139
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,799
Because I already know what he'll say,
"wah, wah, wah, you shouldn't do it."

140
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,951
It's just like he's here.

141
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,638
So we know that previous attempts
to send a message into space...

142
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:30,637
...like the Golden Record on Voyager,
were heavily criticized.

143
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:34,832
Aliens could only play the Golden Record
if they knew how to build a record player.

144
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:39,352
To be fair, I watched E.T. build a telephone
out of a Speak & Spell and an umbrella.

145
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,555
-Dude was like a little brown MacGyver.
-That would be helpful if E.T. were real.

146
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,396
Well, my feelings were real
when he was about to die.

147
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,676
My God, when he's on the table
and they used the paddles on him.

148
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,955
And he's all white.

149
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:57,672
And they zip him up in that bag.

150
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,273
And Gertie can't stop crying.

151
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,959
And the flower dies.

152
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,470
-Okay, let's talk about something else.
-All right.

153
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,950
So it sounds like we need a way
to communicate that's simple.

154
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,271
And doesn't require outside machinery
to be built to access it.

155
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,916
It's also a problem because we don't know
if the aliens who find this can see.

156
00:09:16,079 --> 00:09:18,673
They might communicate
in a totally different way than us.

157
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,277
Like when my dog is mad at me,
she tells me by peeing in my slippers.

158
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,315
That's actually a valid example.

159
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,278
Animals do deliver messages through scent.

160
00:09:29,439 --> 00:09:32,112
Bees talk to each other by dancing,
whales have songs--

161
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:36,716
Penny has about 20 different ways of rolling
her eyes that each mean something different.

162
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:40,952
So what it sounds like is what we want
is a device that can deliver a message...

163
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,793
...through not only sight
but other senses as well.

164
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:44,948
The most basic sense...

165
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,715
...that any space-faring civilization
would have to possess is touch.

166
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,667
Ooh! Ooh, ooh.
We could make a video-playing device...

167
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,469
...that simultaneously translates
the information into a tactile medium.

168
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,948
All we have to do
is rig a 3D communication system.

169
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,633
-We can totally do that.
-I know.

170
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,233
-This is great.
-Know what else it is?

171
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,391
-What?
-Exactly what Sheldon and Howard said.

172
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,111
Well, thank you for peeing in my slippers.

173
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,234
[SINGING] It's the eye of the tiger
It's the ear of the bat

174
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,712
It's the whiskers of the catﬁsh
And the walrus

175
00:10:24,239 --> 00:10:27,595
Hang on.
Not that your song isn't terrible, it is.

176
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,316
But how do you mention bats
and leave out sonar?

177
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,074
You didn't let me finish.

178
00:10:34,319 --> 00:10:37,994
[SINGING]
And also regarding the bat

179
00:10:38,199 --> 00:10:40,155
It has sonar

180
00:10:41,999 --> 00:10:44,229
-Hey.
-Hello.

181
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,473
Look...

182
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:49,517
...I know you guys are upset.
But we've talked about it...

183
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,752
...and we think it'd be beneficial
for you to be part of the project.

184
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,229
Well, well, well, did you hear that, Sheldon?

185
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,791
I'm sorry. I was trying think of what rhymes
with "nose of the aardvark."

186
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,317
We want you back on the project with us.

187
00:11:05,479 --> 00:11:10,269
Well, well, well, did you hear that, Howard?

188
00:11:10,479 --> 00:11:13,949
Look, we admit it, the idea that you guys
came up with was really good.

189
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,838
And I'd love your help.

190
00:11:15,999 --> 00:11:18,274
I suppose it couldn't have been easy
for you to say.

191
00:11:18,439 --> 00:11:20,031
It wasn't.

192
00:11:20,599 --> 00:11:21,588
So are you in?

193
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,029
-Certainly.
-Sure.

194
00:11:24,199 --> 00:11:28,112
Great. Now that we're all on the same page,
let's get together tonight and work on it.

195
00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:31,231
Get together tonight?
Leonard, stop trying to control everything...

196
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,709
...and give poor Raj a chance to come up
with what we should do. Go ahead.

197
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:37,791
-I think we should do it right now.
-Tonight works better for me.

198
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,518
Okay.

199
00:11:45,319 --> 00:11:47,833
P E N N Y :
Okay, it's just an audition.

200
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:49,358
Why am I nervous?

201
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,597
Maybe it's a good thing.
It just means I want it.

202
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,438
And I can have it.

203
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,517
This feels right. Why did I ever give this up?

204
00:12:02,439 --> 00:12:04,509
Yeah, I'm starting to remember.

205
00:12:06,999 --> 00:12:10,958
So I'd like to try a technique
where no one gets steamrolled.

206
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,114
When you talk,
instead of bringing up a new idea...

207
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:17,511
...respect what was just said
by building on it.

208
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,832
Uh, building on that,
we should order dinner.

209
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,390
How is that building on what he just said?

210
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,757
Building on what Sheldon said,
I could go for Chinese.

211
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:30,911
Hang on. Building on what Leonard said,
no one built on what I said.

212
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:34,788
Building on building on that, there's a new
build-your-own pizza place on Colorado.

213
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,113
-Building on that, I'm lactose intolerant.
-No, I saw the menu, they have soy cheese.

214
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,350
You didn't say "building on," you're out.

215
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:44,794
-lt's not Simon Says.
-You're missing the point.

216
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,918
You're out and you're out, I win.
Who wants pizza?

217
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,715
Penny?

218
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:55,831
-Oh, hey.
-Hey. I haven't seen you audition in a while.

219
00:12:55,999 --> 00:12:58,513
Yeah, I got ajob
as a pharmaceutical sales rep.

220
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,477
-You quit acting?
-Kind of.

221
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,837
But now I get to act like inflamed heart
is only "a mild side effect."

222
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,796
I heard you can make good money
doing that.

223
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,997
Yeah, it's going okay,
but I do miss this sometimes.

224
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,149
Really?

225
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,231
Because I gotta tell you,
lam so sick of the humiliation...

226
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,960
-...and being treated like a piece of meat.
-Chelsea?

227
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,788
Wish me luck.

228
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,554
They're gonna love you.

229
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:27,636
I heard she's pushing 40
and everything's fake.

230
00:13:28,479 --> 00:13:31,710
Yeah, I started that rumor.

231
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,994
Since we agree on the delivery system for
the message, maybe we should talk about...

232
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,513
...what the message could be.

233
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:41,147
Well, I think we should show
what Earthlings look like.

234
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:44,948
The plaque they sent on the Pioneer probe
had a drawing of a naked man and woman.

235
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,394
Yeah, I never cared for that.

236
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:52,635
It's advertising to predator races
just how soft and squishy we are.

237
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,869
Squeeze yourself.

238
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:55,631
Oh, don't be offended.

239
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,076
You know of the four of us,
you have the most veal-like consistency.

240
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:05,551
Maybe we can appear non-aggressive,
but also protect ourselves if necessary.

241
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,949
Like smiling and waving with one hand...

242
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,157
...but the other hand
holding the severed head of a tiger.

243
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,315
You wanna send a passive-aggressive
message into space? That's ridiculous.

244
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,948
Oh, you mean passive-aggressive
like posting pictures...

245
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,511
...of you and your wife eating cosmopolitan
balls that you know belong in my mouth?

246
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:28,752
Maybe Howard meant passive-aggressive
like asking our group's help...

247
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,592
...and then only choosing Leonard.

248
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,309
Look, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings...

249
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,558
...but you two have strong personalities
and always end up taking over.

250
00:14:37,719 --> 00:14:38,834
It's not always.

251
00:14:38,999 --> 00:14:41,957
What about when we went to Comic-Con
dressed like Jabba the Hutt?

252
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:46,277
You got to be Jabba's head
and I got to be his fat slug butt.

253
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,910
We looked great.

254
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,511
You let a guy sit on me.

255
00:14:52,999 --> 00:14:55,957
He was dressed as Princess Leia.
It made a nice picture.

256
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,272
I'm just saying,
sometimes Raj and lfeel pushed aside.

257
00:15:01,439 --> 00:15:05,068
Yeah, like when you took Sheldon to Texas
and showed him all around NASA.

258
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:07,230
You didn't even think
to ask me and Leonard.

259
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:09,392
You know what? You're right.

260
00:15:09,599 --> 00:15:10,827
lshould've asked you.

261
00:15:10,999 --> 00:15:14,594
And if he does ask you, go, it's amazing.

262
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:20,477
If we're talking about being left out, you
guys went to Skywalker Ranch without us.

263
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,029
Oh, I recommend that too.
That was a magical experience.

264
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,838
Wait. Sheldon spent a whole day with
James Earl Jones and never told any of us.

265
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:32,037
I sure did. Oh, my goodness.

266
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:35,157
From Jabba's head
to ice cream with Darth Vader.

267
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,151
I'm having a heck of a ride.

268
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:41,272
Clearly, good things happen
when I'm in charge.

269
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:45,318
Now, why don't you boys step aside?
Let me knock this project out.

270
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,835
Sheldon, you're not in charge.
Raj is in charge.

271
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:50,229
Leonard, who's really in charge?

272
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,916
The person in charge
or those who put him in charge?

273
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:58,357
He's right.
If you think about it, we're all in charge.

274
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,433
No, the guy in charge is in cha--
Why's everyone so bad at these?

275
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,635
I mean, the whole experience reminded me
about how much I hated that world.

276
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,439
You know, the anxiety, the depression,
the negativity.

277
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,033
I don't wanna feel those things.

278
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:15,509
I wanna sell drugs to people
who feel those things.

279
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:20,148
I can't believe you got up and walked out
of an audition for a big movie.

280
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:23,709
I did. I mean, I walked in, read for the part,
then stunk up the place.

281
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,353
But then I walked right out.

282
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:29,434
I'm glad you have a new appreciation
for yourjob.

283
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,149
I do. And I don't think I've ever thanked you
properly for helping me get it.

284
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:37,871
"Properly," "at all,"
it's just words I've never heard.

285
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,951
Well, thank you. You're
a good friend and you changed my life.

286
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,873
You're welcome. Hey,
now that you're making some real money...

287
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,310
...maybe you could take your friend out
for a nice thank-you dinner.

288
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:50,107
-Sure.
-You have to invite your other friend...

289
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:54,033
...because she overheard you talking
and it would be awkward to exclude her.

290
00:16:54,999 --> 00:16:56,830
-Okay.
-How about now?

291
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,909
All right.

292
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:03,197
Don't forget your wallet.
