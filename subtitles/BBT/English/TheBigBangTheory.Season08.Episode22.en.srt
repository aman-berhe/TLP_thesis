Okay, we should leave in about an hour.
You all packed?

00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:23,312
I need to throw in a few last-minute things.
You know, makeup, underwear, clothes.

7
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:27,716
If your bathroom floor counts
as a carry-on, you're packed.

00:00:28,959 --> 00:00:31,757
Have you ever given a high school
commencement speech before?

No. It's pretty exciting.

-How would I be blinded?
-At the end of the ceremony...

...all the students throw
those pointy hats in the air.

-l'll take my chances.
-Fine.

15
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,392
I wonder if they make
"I told you so" cards in Braille.

16
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:55,949
Look, the problem
with commencement speeches...

17
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,712
...is that they're boring.

this experience with Penny.

my old stomping grounds.

-Oh, I pack light.

Jersey Shore and Real Housewives.

-No, it's like that.

Yes. We'll also have time

-All right.

from the fully up...

Just flip the switch until the lights
on the drone change to solid yellow.

Rajesh, is your father seeing someone?

167
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,438
All I know, Mommy,
is that he's a single, wealthy doctor...

168
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,712
...and now, for some reason,
there's no money for your little boy.

169
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,188
Well, however much money
your father was giving you...

170
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,158
-...l'll give you more.
-Thank you, Mommy, I love you.

171
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,998
Helicopters for everybody.

172
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:02,038
What's taking so long?

173
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,312
-I don't think this is gonna work.
-Just let me see.

174
00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:14,875
Sweetie, you know you're supposed
to wear clothes under the graduation gown.

175
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,718
A, surprised you know that.

176
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,868
B, I wanted to look
like a sexy graduate for you.

177
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,356
-Well, you do.
-Oh, thank you.

178

You're gonna be on Skype.
They're not gonna see your legs.

179
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:34,112
I'm gonna go put on pants just in case.
But I have to say, this is very freeing.

180
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:38,150
Add a belt and I'll take you someplace nice.

181
00:10:38,319 --> 00:10:41,311
Ooh. Done and done.

182
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:50,397
Okay, I think I've narrowed it down
to a faulty pin...

183
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,397
...on the onboard communication chip.

184
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,996
Very impressive.

185
00:10:55,199 --> 00:10:57,030
You know, when you're done with that...

186
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:59,554
...can you look at this?

187
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,151
It doesn't make smoke anymore.

188
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,191
One toy at a time.

189
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,920
Sorry. Yeah, maybe it's for the best.

190
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,680
I hear locomotive smoke
is the second leading cause...

191
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,712
...of death among train aficionados.

192
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,718
-What's the first one?
-Suicide.

It's not about the money.

It's about solving a problem.
It's why I became an engineer.

it's what I'm trained to do, it's who I am.

-What?
-There's two kinds of people in this world.

204

205
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,911

who call tech support.

I was in this auditorium.

214

played keep away with my asthma inhaler.

But enough about my 10-year reunion.

216
00:12:30,319 --> 00:12:33,356
I'd also like to take a moment
to thank my beautiful fiancée...

217
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,671
...for helping to make this speech possible,
even though weather nearly prevented it.

218

he was gonna point it at me, so....

-Okay, bye.

-Battery charged?
-Check.

Nothing, I was just calling to check in,

to think I'm some sort of playboy.

she'd get an idea like that.
