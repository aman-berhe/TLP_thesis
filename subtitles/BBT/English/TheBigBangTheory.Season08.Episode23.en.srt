1
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:05,435
Leonard, what time
does your mom get in?

2
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:08,716
-I don't know. Tomorrow morning?
-Don't you want to know for sure?

3
00:00:08,919 --> 00:00:10,989
As soon as she flies
into California airspace...

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,919
...l'll feel a disturbance in the Force.

5
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:18,112
It's so nice both of your moms are
coming in to see you guys get an award.

6
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:21,113
Well, my mother's been there
for every honor I've won...

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,517
...since I beat out my twin sister
for the "Did It On The Potty" trophy.

8
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,873
-How does this look?
-Aw, it's so nice. She's gonna love it.

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,072
Sure, his mom gets roses.

10
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,908
When I want them they're a
"bouquet of severed plant genitals."

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,636
You act like I didn't get you
that mushroom log on Valentine's Day.

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,272
He's right, roses die,
but a moist, rotting log...

13
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:46,915
...will pump out mushrooms
for two or three magical years.

14
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,389
Your mom's never been thrilled
with our relationship.

15
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:51,993
Maybe I should get her something
so she warms up to me.

16
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,755
If you could run out and get a PhD,
that might make her like you.

17
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:58,189
-Really? It didn't work for you.
LEONARD: Mm-hm.

18
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,112
-Think the moms will get along?
-They're pretty different.

19
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,918
Maybe they'll be best friends.

20
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,714
One of them is brilliant.
One is sweet and simple.

21
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,717
Sound familiar?

22
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,711
Shelly, I'm so proud of you
and Leonard for getting this award.

23
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,115
-Thank you, Mother.
-I tried to read your paper...

24
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,635
...but it was very hard for me to understand.

25
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,558
It's quite straight-forward, actually.

26
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,355
It describes a new model of
the universe that conceptualizes it...

27
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,710
...as the surface of
an n-dimensional superfluid.

28
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,592
Interesting. You can believe that...

29
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,396
...but God filling an Ark with
animals two-by-two is nonsense.

30
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,431
What did they feed the lions, Mother?

31
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,273
The floating bodies
of drowned sinners, of course.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,438
Listen, Leonard's mom is a renowned
psychiatrist and woman of science.

33
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:19,427
Can you please keep the Bible babble
to yourself while she's here?

34
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:23,314
-Are you ashamed of me?
-Of course not, I love you.

35
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:28,229
I'm just embarrassed by
the things you believe, do and say.

36
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,509
Well, I love you too.

37
00:02:34,359 --> 00:02:36,668
My little bowl of lion chow.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,991
So have you and Penny
set a wedding date?

39
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,475
No, we're kind of taking it slow.

40
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,352


41
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:50,507
What does that mean?

42
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,393
You've been on and off
with this woman for seven years...

43
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,388
...and engaged for one year.
One has to wonder if there's a problem.

44
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,512
Are you having satisfactory intercourse?

45
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,636
Yes, Mother.

46
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,117
BEVERLY:
Only satisfactory, I see.

47
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,271
I change my answer. It's amazing, it's hot.

48
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,278
We can barely keep
our hands off each other.

49
00:03:17,999 --> 00:03:22,675
Seems odd to try and impress
your mother with your sexual prowess.

50
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,199
But then you always did have
that unresolved Oedipal complex.

51
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,277
See, this right here, what you're doing...

52
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,040
...can you please not do that
around Sheldon's mom?

53
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,878
BEVERLY:
Why, are you attracted to her too?

54
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,432
Of course not. She's just
a very sweet and God-fearing lady...

55
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,715
...and you have to be
respectful of her beliefs.

56
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,474
Leonard, I'm an adult,
I know how to conduct myself...

57
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,989
...around people
from different walks of life.

58
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,918
-Thank you.
-Where is she from again?

59
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,031
-East Texas.
-Ugh.

60
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,359
Hey, look who's here.

61
00:03:56,559 --> 00:04:00,108
Dr. Hofstadter, it's so good to see you again.

62
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,629
Likewise. I read your paper,
it was very impressive.

63
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,354
-Thank you.
-We just spent two hours in traffic.

64
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:09,676
Did you think to mention to me
that you liked our paper?

65
00:04:09,879 --> 00:04:13,394
Of course I did. But it's a mother's job
to make sure her child's self-esteem...

66
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,555
...is not dependent on anyone's approval.

67
00:04:17,559 --> 00:04:20,119
That's so sweet,
you think I have self-esteem.

68
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:23,948
Dr. Hofstadter, I want you to
meet my mother, Mary.

69
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,116
-So nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too.

70
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:28,549
-How was your flight?
-Very pleasant. And yours?

71
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:31,193
Lovely. Almost as if someone--
Not saying who.

72
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:33,788
--was watching over the plane.

73
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,078
You're kidding, right?

74
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,108
Subtle, Mom. Real subtle.

75
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,751
-Stuart....
-Morning.

76
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,193
We talked about this.

77
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,789
I don't mind you living here,
but we gotta have rules.

78
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,877
And rule number one is pants.

79
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,192
Hey.

80
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,032
You must be very proud of your son.

81
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:13,359
Oh, yes. He recently argued
a case before the Supreme Court.

82
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,318
He did?

83
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:19,475
Oh, you mean this son.

84
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,150
Sure, he's terrific.

85
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,518
Beverly, would you like
to see the math I worked out...

86
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,238
...to support our hypothesis?

87
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,000
You mean my hypothesis.
l hypothesized it all by myself.

88
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,071
Calm down, dear.

89
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:35,788
Mary, I'm curious,
when did you first realize...

90
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,036
...that your son had
such a remarkable mind?

91
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,077
Oh, good question.

92
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,750
Everyone loves stories
about Sheldon Cooper, boy genius.

93
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,078
Well, I have to say when he was 13...

94
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,033
...and tried to build
a nuclear reactor in the tool shed.

95
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:51,878
Oh, this is a good one.

96
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,552
First thing you have to know
about Shelly is, since he was little...

97
00:05:55,719 --> 00:05:59,155
...he was always concerned
with the well-being of others.

98
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,191
And he didn't think that it was fair
for people to pay for electricity...

99
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,596
...so he was gonna power
the entire town for free.

100
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,636
Tell her about the uranium!

101
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,957
Oh, well. Oh, this is adorable.

102
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,357
When he arranged to
get some yellow cake from Chad...

103
00:06:17,559 --> 00:06:21,234
...I thought he was talking about
Twinkies from one of his friends.

104
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,194
But I wasn't because
I didn't have any friends.

105
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:27,792
[LAUGHS]

106
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,035
It turns out that this little scallywag
was trying to use my Visa card...

107
00:06:32,239 --> 00:06:34,799
...to buy uranium from an African warlord...

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,355
...in the country of Chad.

109
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,391
Sounds like Sheldon was a handful.

110
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:42,992
Oh, he was a handful.

111
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:45,309
l was a handful.

112
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,792
You still are.

113
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,795
Mom, tell Mary the story...

114
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:56,388
...about howl made
a Van de Graaff generator...

115
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,158
...out of our vacuum cleaner.

116
00:06:58,799 --> 00:07:02,633
All right.
He broke the vacuum cleaner.

[GUNFIRE AND SWORD swoosmNe
ON TV]

118
00:07:08,359 --> 00:07:10,509
For a while, everything was vampires...

119
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,079
...now it's all zombies.

120
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,635
I wonder what the next monster fad will be.

121
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:17,069
We haven't had
a good invisible man in awhile.

122
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,754
Clearly you've never seen me
try to talk to a woman.

123
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,396
Guys, in the time you've been
sitting here playing video games...

124
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,552
...I got the car washed,
picked up supplies and went to the bank.

125
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,751
I put on pants.

127
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,031
Okay, I don't know
when I became the mother...

128
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,316
...to three lazy teenagers,
but it stops today.

129
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:42,828
You guys are cleaning
the kitchen, top to bottom.

Yes or no, do you have clothes
in my laundry now?

132
00:07:49,239 --> 00:07:50,638
I do.

133
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:54,837
And some of it is wool,
so dry flat if possible.

134
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:01,712
Here's a picture of me receiving
my Bachelor of Science degree.

135
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,477
You don't look very happy.

136
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,870
Well, I had just begun puberty....

137
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:11,997
It was figuratively and literally
one of the hairiest moments of my life.

138
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:15,276
Shelly does not like change.

139
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,675
True, but all the clenching in the world...

140
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,440
...will not keep testicles in your abdomen.

00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:26,510

-Hello.

Good to see you again, dear.

00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,593
That's what I'm talking about.

148
00:08:38,199 --> 00:08:40,554
So, Mom, you haven't seen Penny
since we got engaged.

149
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:42,954
-Here, let me show you the ring.
-Oh.

150
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,549
Lovely. Must've been very expensive.

151
00:08:45,719 --> 00:08:48,517
Oh, no. Not at all.
We found a place online...

152
00:08:48,719 --> 00:08:52,394
...that repurposes diamond drill bits.

153
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,792
We did not, that's not true.

154
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,676
Can I speak to you alone for a second?

155
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,238
Oh, sure.

156
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:02,316
It came from Tiffany's.

157
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,750
-You mean the box, right?
-Keep walking.

158
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,395
It really doesn't matter to me
how much he spent on the ring.

159
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,192
Ithink.

160
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,633
Did I misspeak about the ring?

161
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,228
Yes, and we'll get back to that.

162
00:09:18,439 --> 00:09:19,792
Even with your mother here...

163
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,678
...you're deliberately hogging
all the attention from my mom.

164
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,750
You're like those elephant seal pups...

165
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:27,354
...that steals the milk from two mothers.

166
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,676
Do you mean what marine biologists
refer to as super weaning?

167
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:34,677
Yes, you are a super weaner!

168
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:39,711
Well, now I have to correct you.

00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:46,069
...the more accurate comparison
would be when two mother seals...

171
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:48,349
...actively seek to nourish the same pup.

172
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,471
Sol believe the term you're looking for...

173
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,478
...is a "double mother suckler."

174
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,554
You're right.
That is the term I'm looking for.

175
00:09:57,719 --> 00:10:00,950
You are a dirty double mother suckler.

176
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,038
Okay. Now that we have
the terminology straightened out...

they are married in the eyes of the Lord.

Ugh.

182

"Ugh"? The Bible is "ugh" to you?

183
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,677
No, I'm sorry, that was inappropriate.

184
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:35,237
As a psychiatrist, I know how important
people's superstitions can be to them.

185

You wanna talk about superstitions?
Sheldon sent me the books you wrote.

186
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,069
All that nonsense
about super-egos and ids.

187
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,430
What bull dropped that on the barn floor?

188
00:10:46,999 --> 00:10:49,229

-When I was pregnant with Shelly...

198
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,757
...l was driving to church,
and l was praying to the Lord...

199
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,077
...to give me a son
smarter than his dumb-ass daddy.

200
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,077

and I saw a Jesus bobblehead...

201
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,113
...in the Subaru next to me nodding "Yes."

...and talk about
something safe like shoes...

208
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,480
...or how cute little Chinese babies are.

209

likes me better than she likes you!

She does work hard around here.

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,877
Yeah, maybe it's a good thing
if she stops babying you so much.

216

She doesn't baby me.

217
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,190
I saw her pull you home in a wagon.

218
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,435
For your information, I twisted my ankle
chasing the ice cream truck.

219

Face it, dude, Bernadette treats you
the same way your mother used to...

220
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:44,909

how her unconditional love for you...

230

...is diametrically opposed
to my own parenting strategies.

as a reward for achievement...

raise a child or train a rat.

240
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,988
Perhaps. But my mom made me
spaghetti with chopped-up hot dogs...
