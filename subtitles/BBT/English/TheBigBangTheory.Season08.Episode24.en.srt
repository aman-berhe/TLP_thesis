1
00:00:07,239 --> 00:00:10,436
Can you believe it's been five years
since our first date?

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,198
I know.

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,754
Do you think I should start
watching The Flash TV show?

4
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:23,149
That's what you're thinking about?

5
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,997
Well, one of the things.

6
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:27,989
Are any of them rne?

7
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:29,548
Yes.

8
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:32,637
I thought, "I can't decide
if I should watch The Flash TV show.

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,592
I know. I'll ask Amy."

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,398
Anyway....

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,989
What are you doing?

12
00:00:41,279 --> 00:00:43,668
You're right. You did kind of kill the mood.

13
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:45,798
I didn't kill anything.

14
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:48,792
You did, talking about your TV stupid show.

15
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:50,393
Excuse me.

16
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,798
Starting to watch a television show that might
run for years isn't a decision to take lightly.

17
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,038
I'm wrestling with a big
commitment issue here.

18
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,669
Really?

19
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:02,757
That's the commitment issue
you're wrestling with?

20
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:05,515
Sheldon, do you understand the irony...

21
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,154
...of your fixation
on a man with super speed...

22
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,669
...while after five years
all I can get out of you...

23
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,269
...is a distracted make-out session
on a couch?

24
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,990
lrony's not really my strong suit.

25
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,756
But I have been getting better with sarcasm
if you want to give that a try.

26
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,470
Oh, sure, I'd love to.

27
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,957
Whenever you're ready.

28
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,914
I don't want to rush you,
but I'm closing early tonight.

29
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,953
Ooh. Hot date?

30
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,232
No, I overheard Bernadette tell Howard
she's making him a meatloaf...

31
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,079
...and you don't have to not ask me twice.

32
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,838
If I stick a lightbulb on this...

33
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,918
...wouldn't it make a great lamp
for my bedroom?

34
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,798
You're kidding, right?

35
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,712
Oh, is this freaking you out?

36
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,952
Well, I guess I'm just more of a...

37
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,350
...Pottery Barn, Crate & Barrel kind of guy.

38
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,195
Maybe Pier 1 ifl really want to cut loose.

39
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,751
All right, never mind.

40
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,678
No, hey, you should totally get it.

41
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,274
-In fact, I'll buy it for you.
-Sold.

42
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,918
-Raj, you don't have to do that.
-Too late, no returns.

43
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,117
That was really intense.

44
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,959
Now we know. Next time we go
to the farmer's market...

45
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:50,629
...the order is petting zoo first,
then buy vegetables.

46
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,438
-Hey.
-Oh, good, you're here. I need your assistance.

47
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,955
Can it wait until I put a Band-Aid
on a goat bite?

48
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,153
What happened?

49
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,436
Your buddy got mugged
by some baby farm animals.

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,319
Been there.

51
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,239
-So, what do you need help with?
-Amy's mad at me, and I'm not clear why.

52
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,471
Okay. Were you talking
before she got upset?

53
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,908
-Yes.
-That's probably it.

54
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,073
What'd you say to her?

55
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,636
ljust asked her ifl should start
watching the new Flash TV series.

56
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,229
-And that made her angry?
-Baffling, right?

57
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,711
We were necking like a couple of hooligans
under the school bleachers.

58
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,951
I stopped so I could ask the question.

59
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,749
Next thing I know, goodbye,
kissy face, hello, yell-y face.

60
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,116
Sheldon, when you're kissing a girl,
she expects the attention to be on her.

61
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,279
It was. I asked her if she thought
I should watch The Flash.

62
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,115
Yeah, I'm tapping out. Leonard?

63
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,830
I guess your main concern
is the time commitment...

64
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,917
...of watching an entire season
of a show.

65
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,519
Oh, no, notjust a season.

66
00:03:54,679 --> 00:03:58,797
If I'm in, I'm in for the whole run,
even if the quality declines.

67
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,476
I get it. Smallville almost wrecked you.

68
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,033
Yeah.

69
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:05,310
Exactly. You know, I waited 1!) years...

70
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,795
...to see a guy everyone knows can fly, fly.

71
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:12,515
What's wrong with you two? He was talking
about television during their date.

72
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,393
Oh, notjust date night.
Our fifth anniversary.

73
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,512
That's even dumber than you wondering
if being bitten by a goat...

74
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,511
...would give you the powers of a goat.

75
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,278
If that happens, don't make me wait 10 years
to watch you eat a tin can.

76
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,114
Have you guys noticed Emily
has a bit of a twisted side?

77
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,912
Because she has weird tattoos?

78
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,072
No, because she wants to have sex
with me in a graveyard.

79
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,557
One more time?

80
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:44,917
She and l were supposed to watch
the new Avengers movie tonight.

81
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,038
It was sold out. I said, "What else
do you want to do?" She said:

82
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,038
"Let's go to a cemetery
and do it on somebody's grave."

83
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,350
Like, a random person
or somebody she knew?

84
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,476
What difference does it make?

85
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,879
Well, if it's her father's grave
and they didn't get along...

86
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:03,870
...then you know she holds a grudge.

87
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,109
The only issue is that
everybody has their own thing.

88
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,999
As long as it's two consenting adults,
I don't see the harm.

89
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,232
What if it's one consenting adult
and one who pretends to consent...

90
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,590
...because he's afraid of being alone?

91
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:21,509
Well, then I guess bring a blanket.
The grass gets damp at night.

92
00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:26,193
I don't know, guys.
Maybe this relationship isn't for me.

93
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,353
Maybe I should break up with her.

94
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,593
Heh. Right. You're gonna break up with a girl
who has sex with you. You believe this guy?

95
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:36,599
I think if Raj wants to break up
with a girl, he can do it.

96
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:40,269
-How are you saying that with a straight face?
-I don't know.

97
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,555
[BOTH LAUGH]

98
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,319
You guys are being jerks.

99
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:45,396
Buddy, other than Jenny Craig...

100
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,120
...you've never broken up
with a girl in your life.

101
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,919
You're one to talk.

102
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:52,309
Complaining about Stuart living here
the past year.

103
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,551
-Don't see you showing him the door.
-Not the same. Emily's a person.

104
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,598
Stuart's more like an infestation.
Something you spray for.

105
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:04,112
Baloney, okay? You two are as afraid
of hurting someone's feelings as I am.

106
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,277
That's not true.
We were just laughing right in your face.

107
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,631
-Thanks for cooking.
-My pleasure.

108
00:06:11,799 --> 00:06:14,029
-That carrot was delicious.
-Yeah.

109
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,720
lwish I'd fought harder for the rest of them.

110
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,514
Still haven't heard from her?

111
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,231
No, and I'm confused.

112
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,277
It's been nearly 24 hours.

113
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,392
Amy should have figured out
she's wrong by now.

114
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,311
I don't think she's wrong
about you going too slow in the relationship.

115
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,075
Too slow?

116
00:06:37,239 --> 00:06:39,628
Yeah, you haven't even slept together.

117
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:42,519
That's right. It's called foreplay.

118
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,389
And I could make the case that you two
aren't moving forward in your relationship.

119
00:06:48,799 --> 00:06:50,994
Uh, hello?

120
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,429
Hello.

121
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,595
No, Sheldon, we're getting married.

122
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,991
You've been engaged for over a year.
You don't even have a wedding date.

123
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:06,036
Well, we will. We're just not in a rush.

124
00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:07,788
Okay.

125
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,473
We're gonna set a date.

126
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:14,031
Okay, if you say so.

127
00:07:14,239 --> 00:07:16,070
-Things are good right now.
-Really good.

128
00:07:16,239 --> 00:07:18,389
-Focusing on myjob.
-Been busy with our paper.

129
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,949
-Yeah, we'll pick a date when we pick a date.
-Yeah.

130
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,352
Okay.

131
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:27,397
-You know, I can see why Amy's mad at you.
-Yeah, shut up, Sheldon.

132
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,718
Did you eat all my yogurt?

133
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:37,390
The one that makes ladies do the thing
they pretend they don't even though they do?

134
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,229
You know which yogurt I mean.

135
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,156
I didn't touch it. Must've been Stuart.

136
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,318
Maybe Raj is right. Maybe it's time
we tell him he needs to move.

137
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,072
We should've done it months ago.

138
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,991
I know, but his store was reopening...

139
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,720
...and then there were the holidays,
and then he was sick.

140
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:59,312
Yeah, right. Sick.

141
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,677
Look, he didn't have jaundice.
He just looks like that.

142
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:10,671
All right, tonight's the night.

143
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,712
Agreed. When he gets home,
I'm dropping the hammer.

144
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,633
I like when you take charge.

145
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,716
I'm not taking charge.
You're the hammer.

146
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:28,431
So why haven't we picked a date?

147
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,473
-You know why.
-Of course I know why. But just for fun, why?

148
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,429
Not in a rush, busy with work--

149
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:38,834
-Things are good right now.
-Really good.

150
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:43,628
-You still want to get married, right?
-Oh, my God, yes. Why would you even ask?

151
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,671
Don't know.
Because we don't have a date?

152
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,273
-You want a date, pick a date.
-lt's notjust the date.

153
00:08:48,439 --> 00:08:49,872
We haven't talked
about anything.

154
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,951
Big wedding, small wedding,
indoor, outdoor.

155
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,553
Outdoor? Ugh.

156
00:08:53,719 --> 00:08:56,597
I can RSVP no right now.

157
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,078
Okay, indoor it is. Big or small?

158
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,759
-Is your dad paying?
-I doubt it.

159
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,512
Okay, two friends each.

160
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,153
-All right, I want it in a church.
-Fine. I want black tie.

161
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,319
-Fine. I want to release butterflies.
-Seriously? Airborne worms?

162
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,352
Okay, well, then it's settled. Small indoor
church wedding, black tie, no butterflies.

163
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,636
-Sounds perfect.
-6 reat.

164
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,075
Still didn't pick a date.

165
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,151
-Stay out of it.
-Shut up.

166
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,549
EMILY: It's a beautiful night.
-Oh, yes.

167
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:35,148
