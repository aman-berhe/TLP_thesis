00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,033
Well, there was this girl.

00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,438
-What did you do?
-Nothing!

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,791
Really, it was just kissing.

6
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:18,835
-All right.
-So we're still getting married?

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:21,835
Yes.

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,994
Because we love each other.

9
00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:26,868
Yes.

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,595
And it's the happiest day of our lives.

11

(LAUGHS) Don't push it.

12
00:00:33,519 --> 00:00:34,872
I need some time

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,158
to take a step back and
re-evaluate our situation.

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,635
Oh.

15
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:43,073
Bye, Sheldon.

Well, Gollum...

You're an expert on rings.

18

What do I do with this one?

19
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,559
So what package are you thinking?

20
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,558
Mmm, this one comes
with music and flowers.

21
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,434
Oh, they even stream the whole thing
live on the Internet.

22
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:07,074
Why would we want that?

23
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,590
'Cause there's a lot of
gorgeous blondes out there

24

a short, nearsighted scientist.

25

Let's give them hope.

Hey, if you're not into this,
we can do it another time.

29
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,830
No.

30
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:26,997
No, I want to. Look, we've put this off
long enough. Let's do it.

31
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,755

-No, why?

-Good, don't do it!
-Why not?

37
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,316
Some important new information
has come to light.

38
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,839
Women are the worst.

39
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,831
I thought it was paper cuts,
but I was wrong.

40
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,597
No piece of paper ever cut me this deep.

41
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,229
What happened now?

42
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,431
Amy has ended our relationship.

43
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:57,871
-Oh, no. Seriously?
-What's going on?

44
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,194
Amy broke up with Sheldon.

45
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:00,388
She did?

-No, of course not.

They thrive on our suffering.

49
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,634
Buddy, I'm so sorry.
Is there anything I can do?

50
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,115
Yes. If I ever talk about
going out with a girl again,

51
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:16,197
roll your eyes at me like I do to you
when you say dumb things.

52
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,308
Sheldon, okay. Just because
you're going through this with Amy

53
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,953
doesn't mean all women are bad.

54
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,228
Whatever.

55
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,276
Hey, ljust heard about you
and Sheldon, are you okay?

56
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,552
Not really, can you come over?

57
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:33,275
Uh, actually, I'm in Vegas.
Leonard and I are about to get married.

58
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,039
Hold on. You're getting married
and you didn't invite me?

59
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:39,555
Well, it was kind of
a spur of the moment thing.

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,910
Wow.

61
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,997
Hope I can catch the bouquet from here.

62
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,312
Amy, don't be like that.

63
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,114
Why did ljust hear Amy's name?

64
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,309
Penny's on the phone with her.

65
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,954
Did she say anything about me?
Never mind, I don't care.

66
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,071
Well, if you care,
you can find out and tell me.

67
00:02:54,279 --> 00:02:56,031
Just don't be shocked
when you find out I don't care.

68
00:02:57,359 --> 00:02:59,827
Okay, will you relax?
You're not missing anything special.

69
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,149
H ey.

70
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,951
She's upset.
Look, it's gonna be a great wedding.

71
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:06,512
Look at you in your little suit.

72
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,433
Amy's upset? Is it about me?

73
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:11,072
No, I think it's because we're eloping.

74
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,434
Your marriage is causing her pain?
Yeah, great, I take it back.

75
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,231
Go ahead and do it. Yay for love.

-Oh!

78

What are you doing here?

79
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,996
When last we spoke,
you said you needed time.

80
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,798
Well, it's only been 11 hours.

81
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,871
The Lord of the Rings trilogy
was nearly 11 hours.

82
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,956
I made you watch that,
you said it was an eternity.

83
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,190
Sheldon, when I'm ready to talk,
I'll let you know.

84
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,515
Very well.

85
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,633
You seem to be headed somewhere.

86
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,188
May I walk with you?

87
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,992
Sure.

88
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,311
Boy am I glad we're going out again.

89
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:16,557
We're not back together.

90
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,670
Why? Well, is there someone else?

91
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:21,598
Just couldn't wait to put that first notch
on your bedpost, could you?

92
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:26,309
If you must know, I'm going to Howard
and Bernadette's to watch the wedding.

93
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,635
And who's this guy you're taking?

94
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:28,749
There's no guy!

95
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,756
Oh, you're going to a wedding alone?
That's sad.

96
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:34,234
I'm not gonna be alone,
I'll be with my friends.

97
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,955
Your friends.
Well, |think you mean my friends.

98
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,718
And why wasn't I invited to this?

99
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:42,468
Maybe because the two of us being there
would make them feel awkward.

100
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,828
We make everyone feel awkward.
That's our thing!

101
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,873
They're running a little behind.
Should be pretty soon.

102
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,069
Okay.

103
00:04:51,359 --> 00:04:54,715
Hey, if you're hungry there's a breakfast
buffet at the strip club next door.

104
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:58,794
Thanks, but I don't like glitter
on my scrambled eggs.

105
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,829
I don't think the strippers
prepare the meal, but okay.

106
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,470
Look, it's not howl pictured it, either,
but I'm still glad we're doing it.

107
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,188
-Me, too.
-You sure?

108
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:13,476
-Yes.
-And you promise you're okay

109
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,669
with everything from the car?

110
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,154
Oh, my God, would you stop bringing it up?

111
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:17,508
You're right. I'm sorry.

112
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:21,750
We have the rest of our lives to dredge up
stuff from the past and fight about it.

113
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,950
So what do you think?
Should we run next door and grab a bite?

114
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:28,468
Well, what if they call our names?

115
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,875
Don't worry, they gave me
this vibrating coaster.

We were together for so long,
I honestly don't know what I'm feeling.

120
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:49,755
Well, that's understandable.
You forgot. It's called "happy".

121
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:53,631
-Howard.
-I'm not saying anything bad.

122
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,274
Just that she was in love with her captor
and somehow managed to escape

123
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,913
from his dark and crazy dungeon.

124
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,356
I know what you're going through,
my last breakup was pretty tough.

125
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:05,710
Oh. What was her name?

126
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,194

For God's sake.
Sheldon, what are you doing?

129
00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:20,428
I didn't want to come in. I was told
it would make everyone feel uncomfortable.

130
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,390
So I'll just stay out here and pretend
that I don't have to go to the bathroom.

131
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,874
-Howard, do something.
-I'm on it.

132
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,836
Sheldon, you being here
might not be making things better.

133
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,029
| see. And is that why
everybody was invited but me?

134
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,116
They didn't invite everybody but you.

135
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:51,033
Bernadette invited me
and Stuart lives here.

00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:00,389
So, when you hear the music,
that's your cue. Any questions?

138
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,829
The package we paid for said the aisle was
supposed to be strewn with rose petals?

139
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,196
-Where are the rose petals?
-WOMAN: We're out.

140
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,795
You know what, it's fine.

141
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,509
WOMAN: We can use the potpourri
from the bathroom.

142
00:07:11,719 --> 00:07:12,629
Okay.

143
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:15,307
-Rea||y, we're good.
-Yep, just wanna get married.

144
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,157
-Yeah.
-Great, I'll see you two up there.

145
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,948
-This is it.
-I know.

146
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,474
I love you.

147
00:07:25,799 --> 00:07:26,834
I love you, too.

148
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:29,512
WOMAN: Was that a yes or no
on the potpourri?

149
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,233
-No thank you.
-We're good.

150
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,679
Raj, you're probably wondering why

151
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:39,188
Amy and | aren't showing
any affection to one another.

152
00:07:40,239 --> 00:07:41,797
Didn't even crack the top ten.

153
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,430
Well, you should know
she recently broke up with me.

154
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:48,750
I said I needed time to think.

155
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:51,237
I'm sure you guys
will figure something out.

156
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,871
You hear that? Raj is devastated.

157
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,876
Sheldon, shh, the wedding's starting.

158
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,510
| see what's happening. Sides are forming.

159
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,836
Well, if Bernadette's on Amy's team,
I pick Howard.

160
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,196
-I'm not taking sides.
-Fine, I guess I'm stuck with Raj.

161
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:06,717
-Rea||y?
-At least you got picked.

162
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,913
Before I go any further, have either
of you prepared your own vows?

LEONARD: Yes.
PENNY: No.

164
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,473
-You wrote vows?
-Yeah.

165
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,035
I don't have any,
you're kind of making me look bad.

166
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,678
It's okay, I don't have to say them.

167
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,872

something mushy, you'll cry. We got this.

any space to think.

00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,232
The champagne of genders.

339
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,710
Well, I may be a man, but I think
I'm the one that screwed up on this one.

340
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:31,995
Yeah, well, and you admit it, like a man.

341
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,518
All you hear women say is,
"I'll just have a salad," you know.

342
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,833
"Where's my lip gloss?"

343
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,318
"I think this element
should be called radium."

344
00:18:43,639 --> 00:18:45,038

345
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,789
I figured that out.

346
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,476
You know what?
She was kind of an honorary man.

347
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:53,110
She had a penis made of science.

348
00:18:57,959 --> 00:19:00,154
I can't believe I'm spending
my wedding night with you.

349
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,028
Really?

350
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,958
I never imagined it any other way.

351
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,028
