It seems only logical that
to restore balance to the relationship,

19
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:58,871
you should find another man
and daily with him.

20

And by daily, I mean some hardcore
mouth-on-mouth action.

00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,833
because that's usually how we met.

172
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,550
Come on, you know Leonard's not like that.

173
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:42,829
No, I wanna believe you. I really do.

174
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,073
Am I being naive?

175
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,153
I don't know.

176
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,794
This is all so new to me.
I'm still processing.

177
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:55,237
You know, he never would've done this
when we first met. He's cockier now.

178
00:09:55,439 --> 00:09:57,395
That's because you made him
more confident.

179
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,633
You know, if you think about it,
without you,

180
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,070
he never would've grown
into the person he is now.

181
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,352
I mean, sure, more women might notice him,

182
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,472
but I think it's better to have a guy
be with you because he wants to be,

183
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,240
and not because he thinks
he doesn't have any other choice.

184
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,473
Never thought about it like that.

185
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,272
Me neither. Not until just now.

186
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:20,632
Hello, I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper,
and welcome to:

187
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,791
(SHELDON READING)

188
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,675
You may notice
that I'm holding a remote control.

189
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:28,951
That's because my cameraperson
and co-host, Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler,

190
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,628
has chosen to end
her relationship with me.

191
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,828
I'm going to pause here
to let that sink in.

192
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:45,188
Okay.

193
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,994
If you need to pause a little longer,
just click the pause button.

194
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,315
But the show must go on.

195
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,635
And thankfully, all of the things
my girlfriend used to do

196
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,717
can be taken care of with my right hand.

197
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,799
Anyway, let's not spend any more time
talking about her.

198
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,352
We're here to talk about flags.

199
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,393
Tonight's theme: flags of countries
that have been torn apart

200
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,830
and the women l have a feeling
were responsible.

201
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:19,192
You guys have any idea how much it costs
to see a marriage counselor?

202
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,833
$250 an hour. Why?

203
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:23,154
How do you know?

204
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,396
Bernadette and l have occasionally
gone to one to,

205
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,238
you know, stay on top of things.

206
00:11:27,439 --> 00:11:29,157
And I'm just hearing about this now?

207
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,233
Dude, just because we're best friends

208
00:11:32,439 --> 00:11:34,953
doesn't mean that l have to tell you
everything that goes on.

209
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,037
You don't have to, you should want to.

210
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,790
Oh, great. There's Mandy.

211
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:45,035
Why are marine biologists always so cute?

212
00:11:45,319 --> 00:11:46,468
I don't know.

213
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:49,274
But I'd like to get lost
in her Bermuda Triangle.

214
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:52,073
It's not helpful.

215
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,032
Then I won't say I'd like to cover
three-quarters of her surface area.

216
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,229
(BOTH LAUGHING)

217
00:11:57,439 --> 00:11:59,634
-Are we done?
-Not yet, this is fun.

218
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,634
Ooh, I know. I'd let her free my Willy.

219
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:04,874
Where are you going?

220
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,877
I'm gonna ask her
if she'd be willing to talk to Penny

221
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:08,273
and tell her she has nothing
to worry about.

222
00:12:08,479 --> 00:12:09,912
-No, Leonard, wait.
-What?

223
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,997
I'd like to SpongeBob her SquarePants.

224
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,237
Now we are done. (LAUGHING)

225
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:19,274
-Hey.
-Hi, Leonard. What's up?

226
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,072
Do you mind if I sit?

227
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,315
Sure.

228
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:27,196
So, um, I've been thinking a lot
about you and me and... The boat.

229
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:29,310
-What about it?
-You know,

230
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,237
what we did when we were drunk.

231
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,635
Oh, no! Did I sleep with you, too?

232
00:12:35,719 --> 00:12:36,868
Nope, we just made out.

233
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:38,751
Oh! Well, good for me.

234
00:12:40,439 --> 00:12:41,838
So, what can I do for you?

235
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:44,952
Uh, okay, well, I got married recently.

236
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,479
Oh, congratulations!

237
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,709
To Sheldon?

238
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:49,908
(CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY)

239
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,315
Never gets old.

240
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,438
No, no, to a girl.

241
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,314
Anyway, ltold her what happened
between you and me

242
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:59,080
and she's concerned about us
seeing each other at work.

243
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,475
It was just a kiss.
Why would you even tell her?

244
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,148
'Cause I didn't want there
to be any secrets between us.

245
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,713
Is that really the reason?

246
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,794
What else would it be?

247
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,629
I don't know. Sounds like you're trying
to sabotage the relationship.

248
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:12,272
No, I don't think so.

249
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,032
Although, Penny did say exactly that.

250
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,435
Okay. Well, that's something
to think about.

251
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:21,235
You know, on some level,
I've always believed

252
00:13:21,439 --> 00:13:23,555
that I don't deserve a woman like her.

253
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,117
Oh, you're gonna think
about that right here?

254
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:32,275
I mean, she's really beautiful.
She can have any guy she wants.

255
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:36,472
Which is probably why it took her
so many years to tell me she loved me.

256
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:38,637
Maybe you should talk
to a therapist about this.

257
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,875
Too expensive.

258
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:46,069
You'd think I'd be used
to women withholding their love.

259
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,316
I mean, my mother did.
I mean, no matter how hard ltried,

260
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:50,589
she just didn't have any interest in me.

261
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,869
Imagine that.

262
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,989
I wonder if that's why! have such
a dysfunctional relationship with Sheldon.

263
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,156
I had a dream the other night
that l was in a cave

264
00:14:01,479 --> 00:14:03,709
and l was nursing a baby.

265
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,918
But the baby had Sheldon's head on it.

266
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,037
And your wife is worried about me?

267
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,549
RAJ: Hey, Leonard!

268
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,234
When you're done,
we came up with a bunch more.

269
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,391
And then the Czech Republic says
to Slovakia,

270
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,194
"I don't think you understand
how being broken up works! "

271
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:28,789
Can you believe that?

272
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:31,229
You'd think that the Czech Republic
would try to hold on to what it had

273
00:14:31,439 --> 00:14:33,077
given that it's not
as young as it used to be.

274
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,552
And I don't see any other countries
lining up to invade its southern borders.

275
00:14:38,439 --> 00:14:39,588
I'm gonna kill him.

276
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,632
But enough about the Czech Republic.

277
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,911
Let's talk about the time Moldova made
Romania a birthday cake.

278
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,759
And Romania said it tasted good
even though it didn't.

279
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,756
And yet, Romania gets dumped.

280
00:14:50,999 --> 00:14:53,035
I'll pause here
while you mull that one over.

281
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,999
I know, right?

282
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:03,549
So? You said you had something to tell me.

283
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:05,317
Okay. Yeah. Um,

284
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,477
do you remember when you accused me
of trying to sabotage our wedding?

285
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,789
Uh-huh.

286
00:15:09,999 --> 00:15:13,150
I've been thinking about it
and you might be right.

287
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:18,514
But... The good news is
that I'm pretty sure I know why.

288
00:15:19,319 --> 00:15:20,274
I'm listening.

289
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,995
Penny, after all these years, I still
feel like maybe I don't deserve you.

290
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,792
Okay, that is the lamest excuse
you could've possibly come up with.

291
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,154
But I get it.

292
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:34,354
You do?

293
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,876
Yeah. You know, sometimes I worry
you're gonna wake up

294
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:39,070
and leave me for someone more like you.

295
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,158
I don't even understand
why you're with someone like me.

296
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,157
Why would I wanna be with someone like me?

297
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:47,393
You know what I mean.

298
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,790
And, you know, maybe the way I've been
reacting was me sabotaging this, too.

299
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,873
(SIGHS) Well, how about we stop
being so scared

300
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:00,309
of losing each other and just be together?

301
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,200
-That sounds nice.
-(S|GHS) Good.

302
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,354
Mmm. (CHUCKLES)

303
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,829
'Cause

304
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,315
I've loved you since the moment we met,

305
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,794
and lwill keep loving you
until the end of time.

306
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,354
Oh.

307
00:16:13,719 --> 00:16:16,756
Oh, my God, that is the most beautiful
thing anyone's ever said to me.

308
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:17,994
Yeah?

309
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:20,429
That's because you're beautiful,

310
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,798
and your beauty fills my heart
with love and song.

311
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:29,798
It's getting kind of cheesy, Leonard.

312
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:32,879
If you think that's cheesy, buckle up.

313
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,670
Penny Hofstadter,
will you please stay married to me?

314
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,553
Oh, damn it, you topped it.

315
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,150
Shall we go to the bedroom
and make this marriage official?

316
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,554
-Yes, please.
-Okay.

317
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,668
Sheldon, I can't believe
you got us a wedding gift.

318
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,475
I don't know why you're so surprised.
I watch movies. | see what people do.

319
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:06,278
-What is this?
-Plane tickets and hotel reservations

320
00:17:06,479 --> 00:17:08,197
for a weekend away in San Francisco.

321
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,231
-Wow!
-That's so great!

322
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:14,068
Yeah, there's Fisherman's Wharf
and Alcatraz and cable cars.

323
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:15,394
We're gonna have so much fun.

324
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,588
(BANGING ON DOOR)

325
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:21,918
-We?
-Is there a problem?

326
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,350
Oh, no, no. ljust, I said, "Whee!"

327
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,116
How dare you go on the Internet
and say mean things about me,

328
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,880
and compare my genitalia
to a part of Czechoslovakia?

329
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,678
You saw through that one, did ya?

330
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,477
I don't know what you were thinking,
but take the video down now!

331
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,710
She watched it.
I'm gonna get that girl back.

332
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:49,071
AMY: I only watched it because you
e-mailed it to me with the subject line

333
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:50,553
"this is gonna make you mad! "

334
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,749
She was listening through the door.
She wants me.

335
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,349
English - SDH
