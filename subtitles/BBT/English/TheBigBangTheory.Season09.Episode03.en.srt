00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:05,590
-Would you pass the mustard?
-Sure.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,672
Hey. Wanna hear a fun fact about mustard?

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,275
Is it that the glucosinolates
which give mustard its flavor

4
00:00:10,479 --> 00:00:13,755
were evolved by the cabbage family as
a chemical defense against caterpillars?

5
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:16,633
Yeah.

6
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:20,155
Well, that was fun. Good for you, Leonard.

7
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:22,838
-Hey there.
-Hey, you're early.

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,233
The movie doesn't start for an hour.

9
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:26,509
Actually, we're not going to the movies.

10
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:29,028
-We are here to kidnap you.
-(CHUCKLES)

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,309
What are you talking about?

12
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:33,397
Well, you eloped and we didn't get
a chance to throw you a bachelor party,

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,953
so there's a van downstairs

14
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:38,469
and we're here to take you
to a surprise location for the weekend.

15
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,832
Well, I'd hardly call this kidnapping.

16
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:42,757
Where's the blindfold?
Where's the duct tape?

17
00:00:43,999 --> 00:00:45,910
Where's the part where you call me
and demand ransom

18
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,237
and I try to keep you on the phone but
you hang up seconds before I can trace it

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,159
and then I say,
"I'm getting too old for this crud"?

20
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,518
When do we leave?

21
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:58,911
-Right now.
-Yeah, Penny packed you a bag.

22
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,314
(CHUCKLING) Wow, okay.

23
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,756
You're seriously going to get in a van
and let these two take you

24
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:04,950
to an unknown destination
for an entire weekend?

25
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,877
Oh, notjust him, you're coming, too.

26
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,349
Oh, and how do you think
you're going to get me to do that?

27
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,391
Unhand me! This is ridiculous!

28
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,238
-I told you to put tape on his mouth.
-(SHELDON GRUNTS)

29
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,031
And I told you he bit me.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

31
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,754
It's bad enough
I'm being taken against my will.

32
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:48,037
I don't see why it has to be
in some hippie's mobile sex dungeon.

33
00:01:49,839 --> 00:01:51,830
Well, Sheldon,
there's something about this van

34
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:54,109
that you're going to find
very interesting.

35
00:01:54,599 --> 00:01:56,237
What? It runs on syphilis?

36
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,112
This van was owned and driven by
your personal physics hero,

37
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,719
Richard Feynman.

38
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,795
-No.
-HOWARD: Yeah.

39
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:09,389
-A buddy of mine let me borrow it.
-This was Feynman's van? That's so cool.

40
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,591
Yeah, nothing's been changed
since he drove it.

41
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,314
I bet he picked up a lot of
cute grad students in this bad boy.

42
00:02:14,559 --> 00:02:16,948
Yeah, and talked about physics with them.
(GASPS)

43
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:20,994
So, are you gonna give us a clue
where we're headed?

44
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,112
Uh, okay. Let's see.

45
00:02:23,399 --> 00:02:26,755

47
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,788
We can drive there.

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,319
Your house?

49
00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:38,077
We are going to México!

50
00:02:38,279 --> 00:02:39,951
Fun, I've never been there.

51
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:45,279
Leonard, don't be fooled. I'm from Texas.
"Me-he-co" is Spanish for Mexico.

52
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,918
What's wrong with Mexico?

53
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,319
Uh, mariachi bands, wild dogs, beans that
jump around 'cause there's a worm inside.

54
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,429
Okay, calm down.
There's a theme to this weekend.

55
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,277
We are going to Mexico in Feynman's van
to stay at the vacation house

56
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,040

with the money from his Nobel Prize.

You sure we can't take you
to a strip club?

60
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:16,395
No, if I wanna see a naked dancing man

61
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,955

while Leonard's in the shower. (CHUCKLES)

62
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,749
-Hi.
-Hey.

63
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,391
I know we're not making a fuss, but,

64
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,591
in the spirit of bachelorette parties,

65
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,632
I made cookies
in the shape of male genitals.

66
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:35,755
You really didn't have to--
Whoa!

67
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,393
That is anatomic.

68
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,350
Thank you. The veins are gummy worms.

69
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:49,274
Oh, look, Jewish and gentile.

70
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:52,992
I had extra dough.

(PHONE CHIMES)

72
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,955
Oh, that's Leonard.
He said they're about to cross the border.

73
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,072
I hope the boys don't get too crazy
in Mexico.

74
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,078
Oh, yeah, right, lock up your daughters

75
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:05,749
or Sheldon might lecture them about
the North American Free Trade Agreement.

76
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,276
Boy, that was a long night for me.

77
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,475
Uh-oh.

78
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,955
According to this Mexican Customs website,

79
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,392
visitors may not bring more than
five laser discs, 20 compact discs

80
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:22,271
or 12 VHS tapes.

81
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:26,109
We don't have any of those.

82
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:27,753
How can you be sure?

83
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,554
Uh, VHS was king when
Feynman drove this van.

84
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:32,351
And for all we know,
there are hidden compartments

85
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:34,675
lousy with Jane Fonda workout videos.

86
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,554
If there was a hidden compartment,

87
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,670
don't you think
you'd be stuffed in it by now?

88
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,513
Are we all up-to-date
on our Yellow Fever inoculations?

89
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,715
You don't need a Yellow Fever shot
to go to Mexico.

90
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,392
You can never be too careful.

91
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,551
I got one last year
before I went to Epcot.

92
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,958
So, Penny, how's married life?

93
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,070
Oh, it's good.

94
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,793
Just wish Leonard
would work up the courage

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,718
to tell Sheldon he's moving in here.

96
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:03,752
You guys still aren't living together?

97
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,752
We are, I mean, he sleeps here,

98
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,269
but it's only a matter of time
before Sheldon has a bad dream

99
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,551
and tries to climb into bed
with the Leonard-shaped pile of pillows.

100
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,836
Speaking of Sheldon,
how's single life treating you?

101
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:18,913
Fine, I guess. I've been focusing on me.

102
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:20,878
l was thinking about
changing my wardrobe.

103
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,354
-Yes!
-Good for you!

104
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:26,269
But then I decided
I don't wanna go changing who I am

105
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:27,878
just because of some man.

106
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,354
-Yes.
-Good for you.

107
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,437
You know, it is normal to wanna change
your look after a breakup.

108
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:36,955
Actually, I was thinking
of making one small change.

109
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,070
-Your sweater?
-Your glasses?

110
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,508
-Your hair?
-Your shoes?

111
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:42,193

113
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:44,788
You really never had that done?

114
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,276
My mom said pierced ears were for whores,
pirates and genies.

115
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:52,758
Okay. Well, you're a grown woman now.

116
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,316
I know, but Sheldon had this clause
in the relationship agreement

117
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:59,477
forbidding cosmetic surgery
unless it's to look like a Klingon.

118
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:03,272
We'll take you to the mall to get it done.

119
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,799
Why? I can do it right here.

120
00:06:05,119 --> 00:06:06,677
-Really? You have a piercing gun?
-PENNY: No.

121
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:09,552
All you need is a needle and an ice cube.
I've done it like a dozen times.

122
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,794
-Oh, I don't know.
-Oh, come on. I'll be gentle.

I hear Mexican police target tourists.

126
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,310
Oh, not a problem. If anything goes down,

127
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:29,191
we just put Koothrappali
in the driver's seat

128
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,992
and slap a sombrero on his head.

129

Dude, how many races
can you offend in a single breath?

130
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,274
I don't know.
Have you watched the Olympics with me?

131
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,395
Sheldon, can you believe that
we're driving in a van that was owned

132
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,478
by one of the greatest scientific minds
of the twentieth century?

133
00:06:45,679 --> 00:06:47,431
It's like the Batmobile. (CHUCKLES)

134
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,989
lf Batman was real.

135

And a physicist. And his car wasn't cool.

136
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,794
It is extraordinary.

137
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,067
Perhaps some of his mojo
will rub off on us.

138
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:01,749
Maybe between this and his beach house,
we'll be inspired to greatness.

139
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,197
I usually don't put too much stock
in charms and talismans,

140
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,315
however even I must admit feeling Richard
Feynman's butt dent cupping my own bottom.

"in a relationship" on Facebook.

all of my Facebook friends know.

So if I wait long enough,

170

I'll just tell him he walked me
down the aisle and it was magical.

171
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:39,551

should know how,

in distress by the side of the road.

174
00:08:47,079 --> 00:08:50,754

someone's shoulders and never coming down.

179
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,753
No, I took the other four off
and when I got to this one, I thought,

180
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,916
"I'm in a rut, let's shake things up."

181
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,193

(GASPS) Nice.

187
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,870
Boy, if my mom could see me now,
she'd lock me in the sin closet.

188
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,153
That's a joke, right?

189
00:09:37,359 --> 00:09:40,476
Actually, the joke was on her, I could
still see the TV through the slats.

190

I'm starting to see why you and your mom
aren't very close.

191
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,911
Bet she'd still tell her
if she got married.

192
00:09:48,199 --> 00:09:49,678
You're not gonna let this go, are you?

193
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:51,437

that they don't know.

198
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:05,915
Yeah. How did it go? Did she make you
crawl into the breaking-up drawer?

199
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:10,796
Uh, well, actually, to be honest,
I haven't told her yet.

I need to tell you.

Well, then, I'm happy for you.

Aw, thank you, Daddy. That means so much.

223

to tell someone something

I got for the tractor?

-No.

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,758

Yeah, this is nothing more
than a physics problem.

251
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,315
Right. Archimedes once said,

252
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,114
"Give me a lever long enough
and a fulcrum on which to place it,

253

"and I shall move the world."

254
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:43,194
Of course, all we need is to find stuff
to make a lever big enough to fix this.

255
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,790
Exactly. I'll bet there's something
around here that could be a lever.

256
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,310
Let's see. A lever, a lever.

257
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,431
Everybody hold on. Let's take this problem
one step at a time.

258
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:56,196
First, we need to decide whether
we're calling it "leever" or "lever."

259
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:01,436
And the sooner we decide it's "leever,"
the sooner we can roll up our sleeves

260
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,790
and not "slehves" and get to work.

261
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,433
We're gonna be here "for-eever."

a big green hand that unscrews it.

why not just use the Hulk?
