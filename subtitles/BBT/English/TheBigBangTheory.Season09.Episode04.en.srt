to The Container Store?

00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,316
It's like I died and went to the

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,596
I still don't understand
why you bought that pill caddie.

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,949
You're a young man.

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,752

Why are you taking your bins over there?

12
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:30,752
Uh, that's just where I need them.

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,916
You know, she doesn't have
a lot of closet space.

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,076
Mmm, what's wrong with your closet?

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,315
Uh...

16
00:00:36,519 --> 00:00:39,033
Well, honey, you know,
now that Leonard and l are married,

17
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,073
it kind of makes sense
that we actually live together.

18
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,759
So, that's all this day was?

19
00:00:43,959 --> 00:00:46,154
A plan to butter me up
before delivering bad news?

20
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,476
-Come on, buddy.
-No, I thought we were friends.

21
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:50,476
You asked for a sip of my lcee.

22
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:53,432
If you'd had your own straw,
I might have said yes.

23
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,511
Sheldon, please,
we already feel bad about this.

24
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,596
Yeah, you know what they don't sell
at The Container Store?

25
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:01,597
Something large enough
to contain my disappointment!

26
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,069
Although, if anyone did, it would be them!

Of course.

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,037
As my relationships with Penny
and Amy are currently strained,

00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:42,276
I'm turning to you
for female comfort and encouragement.

32
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,508
Aww.

33
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,795
I'm honored.

34
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,189
I tried reaching out to my mother,
but she was in Bible study.

35
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,277
Leonard's mother is on a book tour,
my Meemaw was taking a nap,

36
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,438
and after a while,
Siri started repeating her answers.

00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,631
So I'm your seventh choice.

00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,070
Yeah, I know. Top 10, pretty exciting.

How can I help you?

00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:05,795
In addition to Amy leaving me,
Leonard's moving in with Penny.

41
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,833
It's difficult not to feel abandoned.

42
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,316
Well, why don't you
look at this as an opportunity?

43
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:13,998
You had other roommates before Leonard.

44
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,714
Maybe this is a chance
to find someone new.

45
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,350
Hmm, perhaps I could find
someone better than Leonard.

46
00:02:19,559 --> 00:02:21,436
You know, someone I could rub in his face.

47

48
00:02:24,999 --> 00:02:27,991

about taking the smaller bedroom.

-Hey.
-Hey.

00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,868
You know who'd be the perfect roommate?

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,796
Gandalf, but he's a smoker.

00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,990
Stuart! He's been living with us
for a while now.

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,679
I'm sure he'd love
to get us out of his hair.

Nope, couldn't be happier.

It's actually Archie versus Predator.

How could Archie defeat Predator?

You know, give this place
more of a "staying in business" vibe.

I like all kinds of music,
but my favorite genre is free.

talked about playing together.

It's like folk music,
but with a sci-filfantasy theme.

I like it.

what I wanna ask you is

why is there a Band-Aid on your forearm,

156
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:13,990
but then I realized
what I really wanna ask you is,

157
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,918
can you just go?

158
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,040

you have ajob in the sciences.

never tweeted me back.

00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:59,033
Well, they didn't used to be.

172
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,755
You and Leonard and Penny,
you all poisoned me with emotions.

173
00:09:02,999 --> 00:09:07,356
l was like the Tin Man, perfectly content,
until that evil wizard gave him a heart.

174
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:11,515
I don't think that was
the point of the movie.

175
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,278
Fine, then I was like Pinocchio

176
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:16,437
before that jerk Geppetto
went and made him a real boy.

177
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,319
There you go.

178
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,279
-So, what are you thinking for dinner?
-Well, it's Thai food night.

179
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,993
Oh, honey, you don't live
with Sheldon anymore.

180
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,030
You can have anything you want.

181
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,878
(CHUCKLES) You're right.

182
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,109
But what?

183
00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:33,188
Mexican?

184
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,679
Italian? German?

185
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,955
lndian? Greek?

186
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,835
Cuban? Chinese? Pizza?
Barbecue? Korean? Korean barbecue?

187
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,156
-How about Thai food?
-Oh, thank God.

188
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:49,631
Hey, we're going to dinner.
You wanna come?

189
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,193
Oh, lwish I could.

190
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,153
But I realized I've become
too emotionally vulnerable.

191
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,112
So like an operating system,

192
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,999
l'm restoring my life
to the last stable version,

193
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,879
which was in 2003,
the day before I met Leonard.

194
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,191
-You heard him, no.
-Hang on.

195
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:08,794
Wait, you actually think it's 2003?

196
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,679
No, just because I'm living my life
like it was 12 years ago,

197
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,359
doesn't mean I'm delusional.

198
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,313
And, since it is 2003,
I don't know who you are,

199
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,312
so please exit the premises

200
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:21,477
before I call the police
on my stylish, new flip phone.

201
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:34,158
Are you doing okay?

202
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,240
I guess. Just, you know,
worried about Sheldon.

203
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,433
Well, come on. He's a grown man in his 30s

204
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,392
pretending to be a grown man
in his 20s. He's fine.

205
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:44,718
I hope so.

206
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,712
What else can you do?
Move back in with him?

207
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,638
No, of course not, ljust feel bad.

208
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:50,067
Well, so do I.

209
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:52,076
But don't you want to live with your wife

210
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,475
and set the thermostat
to whatever you want?

211
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,069
And have your body tell you when it's time
to go to the bathroom?

212
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,828
You know, not a schedule slipped
underneath your door every morning.

213
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,915
I did like that he had the weather on it.

214
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,999
Trust me, this is the right thing.

215
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,953
No, I know.
And it's not like we're abandoning him.

216
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:13,313
Plus, we can FaceTime him
whenever we want.

217
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:17,395
You know, once iPhones
are invented in his universe. (CHUCKLES)

218
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:21,468
(MUSIC PLAYING FAINTLY)

219
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,074
I can't believe Sheldon
asked you to be his roommate.

220
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:26,474
I can't believe he ran my credit.

221
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,357
Hey, if you're open
to living with someone great,

222
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,676
I'll give you $1,000 to take Stuart.

223
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:36,310
You really should've gone on the Internet
and checked how long

224
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:38,953
that kind of thing lives
before you got one.

225
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,278
I'm sorry, ljust thought you might have
a pasty, weirdo-shaped hole in your life.

226
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,917
Hey, I know Sheldon's quirky,
but he's also brilliant and insightful.

227
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,113
lthink calling him
a weirdo is a little unfair.

228
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,231
Hello, 2003!

229
00:11:57,439 --> 00:11:59,157
Hey, we brought you Thai...

230
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,269
Where is everything?

231
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,277
In my present, it's in the future.

232
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,755
In your present,
it's been crammed in the bedroom

233
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,429
by an enterprising, young man
I met in The Home Depot parking lot.

234
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,189
I know what you're doing.

235
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,992
You're trying to get attention
so we'll feel bad for you,

236
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:16,268
but it's not happening.

237
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,392
No, what I'm doing is
trying to figure out how to live my life,

238
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,794
now that everyone is leaving me.

239
00:12:20,999 --> 00:12:23,194
Knock it off! We're across the hall.

240
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:26,152
As the kids are saying today,
"Talk to the hand."

241
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,318
They're not saying that.

242
00:12:30,319 --> 00:12:31,957
They are in 2003.

243
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,398
No, no, they're really not.

244
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,908
(SINGING) Thor and Doctor Jones

245
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,469
Thor and Doctor Jones

246
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,034
One runs from Loki

247
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,073
The other runs from stones

248
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,238
So, what do you think?

249
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,039
-Wow!
-Yeah.

250
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,233
"Runs from stones" means that big boulder,

251
00:12:55,439 --> 00:12:58,078
but ljust couldn't
rhyme anything with "boulder."

252
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:00,998
Colder, shoulder, soldier, folder--

253
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:02,598
Right. Yeah, right.

254
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,591
But what do you think?

255
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,552
I think it's very cute.

256
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,671
Cute? It's not cute.

257
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:12,632
Cute is children dressed as vegetables.

258
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,191
Okay, fine, it's not cute.

259
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,908
(SCOFFS) Just be honest,
you don't like it.

260
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,476
I didn't say that.
ljust like music you can dance to.

261
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,397
You can dance to this!

262
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:25,268
Uh... Uh...

263
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,869
(SINGING) Thor and Doctor Jones

264
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:30,070
Thor and Doctor Jones

265
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:34,637
One plays with lightning
The other plays with bones

266
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,077
I'm telling you, dude,
the song has no groove.

267
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,871
You can't dance to it.

268
00:13:40,999 --> 00:13:42,591
Who cares? I thought the whole point

269
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,190
of Footprints on the Moon was
to write songs that make people think.

270
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,630
You can do both.
Like Michael Jackson's Billie Jean?

271
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,708
While you're dancing you're thinking,
like, "Darn it, whose baby is it?"

272
00:13:56,319 --> 00:13:59,550
Where's this coming from?
A few hours ago, we both loved this song.

273
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:02,876
I still love it.
| just think there's room for improvement.

274
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,553
You played it for Emily, didn't you?

275
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:07,795
-Yeah, so what?
-You are such a wimp!

276
00:14:07,999 --> 00:14:09,557
I mean, she didn't like it,
now you don't like it.

277
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:14,196
No, no. I'm just evolving as a musician.
You're the one who's stuck in the past.

278
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,875
"The past" was lunch!

279
00:14:19,719 --> 00:14:21,789
You know what's really happening here?

280
00:14:21,999 --> 00:14:24,308
Your girlfriend is breaking up our band.

281
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,800
Wait, she has nothing to do with this.
I am my own man.

282
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:31,230
Oh, please! Your brain belongs
to whoever's willing to sleep with you.

283
00:14:31,439 --> 00:14:32,474
That is so not true!

284
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,514
Really? Remember when you were gonna
get circumcised for Rachel Bernstein?

285
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,837
That had nothing to do with Rachel.

286
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:41,678
It was an overreaction
to a bad zipper injury.

287
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:45,911
I don't need this.

288
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,596
-l'm quitting the band!
-Fine, I quit, too!

289
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,758
-Then get out of my house!
-With pleasure!

290
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,038
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

291
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,838
Raj, wait!

292
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,792
What took you so long?

293
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,070
Buddy, I know me moving in with Penny
feels like a big change, but it's not.

294
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:13,319
How can you say that?
Amy's gone, and you two are married now,

295
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,749
so it's only a matter of time
before you're gone, too.

296
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:17,233
Okay, you don't know what's gonna happen.

297
00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:19,907
No, I do. Eventually,
you'll want more space,

298
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,394
and you'll move into a house.

299
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,352
And then instead of dinner
a couple of times a week,

300
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,198
it'll only be a couple of times a month.

301
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:27,355
And then it'll only be
on special occasions,

302
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,233
like when Bernadette
divorces Wolowitz, you know?

303
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:34,753
Or like when Koothrappali's
weird girlfriend admits

304
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,075
where she buried his body, you know?

305
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,916
Or Amy's wedding, where she's
marrying someone better than me.

306
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:46,629
Okay, look, we don't need
to rush into anything.

307
00:15:46,999 --> 00:15:48,034
All right?

308
00:15:48,719 --> 00:15:51,472
Maybe instead of Leonard
moving in with me, wejust

309
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:53,551
leave things the way they are.

310
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:58,151
And sometimes we'll sleep over there,
and sometimes we'll sleep over here.

311
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,318
But mostly here.

312
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,029
Sure.

313
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,151
What about what you said
in the restaurant?

314
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,998
Well, it's not forever.
It's just for a little while.

315
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,032
If you want,
we could think of him like he's our dog.

316
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:12,752
You can, you know.

317
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,590
I'm happy when you come home,

318
00:16:16,439 --> 00:16:18,350
and I'm scared of fireworks.

319
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,998
By the way, on July fourth,
we're all sleeping here.

320
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,072
-Fine.
-All right, great!

321
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,268
Just give me one minute,

322
00:16:26,439 --> 00:16:28,714
and I'll get started
on a new roommate agreement.

323
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,115
Yeah, nothing from Pratt, we're good.

324

It was Avenger versus archeologist

Indy held his ground
and straightened his fedora
