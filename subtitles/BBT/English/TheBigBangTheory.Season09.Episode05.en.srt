00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,872
-Leonard, I've got terrible news.
-What's going on?

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,319
Before | tell you,
perhaps I should soften the blow.

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,715
Your face is pleasingly symmetrical.

4
00:00:16,919 --> 00:00:17,874
Just tell me.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,792
A Swedish team of physicists

6
00:00:19,999 --> 00:00:22,752
is trying to scoop
our superfluid vortex experiment.

7
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:24,708
That kinda stinks.

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,319
"That kinda stinks"?

9
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:29,591
Why aren't you more upset?
Did I soften the blow too much?

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,997
Yeah, because this, here,
is more like a Picasso painting.

11
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:37,473
-What are we gonna do?
-Perform the experiment, immediately.

12
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:39,909
Well, I'd love to,
but we need liquid helium,

13
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,798
and our shipment's on back order
for a month.

14
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,957
A month? Are you kidding me?

15
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,316
That would've been a good time for you
to soften the blow.

16
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:49,390
That shirt brings out
the blue in your eyes.

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,759
Thank you, aren't you sweet.

18
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,272
Let's go check to see if the university
has any helium in reserve.

19
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,710
Did you know that
I almost didn't wear this shirt today?

20
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,271
Hey, Barry, we're in trouble.
We need liquid helium.

21
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:04,992
Does the department have any we can use?

22
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,235
Sorry, there's a shortage.

23
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:08,953
And what we do have,
I need for my quantum excitation study.

24
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,919
But you won't need much for that.

25
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,078
True. But if it's successful,
I'm having a party with balloons.

26
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,232
Come on, Barry, there's a Swedish team
trying to run our experiment before us.

27
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,555
Can you spare any?

28
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,155
Be honest.

29
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,039
If the shoe was on the other foot,
would you do this for me?

30
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,588
-Yes.
-Not a chance.

31
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,675
-What are you doing?
-He said, "Be honest," so I was honest.

32
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,837
Didn't your mother tell you?
It's the best policy.

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,911
-So, what do you say?
-Hell, no.

34
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:38,992
He could have softened the blow.

35
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,036
(THEME SONG PLAYING)

36
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,955
Why do you need Kripke?

37
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:08,877
Can't you just go to
Party City for helium?

38
00:02:09,799 --> 00:02:11,869
We'd have to go to every Party City
in California.

39
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,792
Sounds like you on Cinco de Mayo.

40
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,954
Hey, people were still talking about
that party on Siete de Mayo.

41
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,672
Leonard, if that Swedish team beats us,

42
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,235
I will never be able to enjoy anything
from their country again.

43
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:28,148
Which is a shame,

44
00:02:28,359 --> 00:02:31,874
because Swedish meatballs are my favorite
toothpick-delivered meatball.

45
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,991
If you need liquid helium so bad,

46
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:37,669
I know a guy who can get you some
if you don't ask too many questions.

47
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,915
-Who is he?
-Where does he work?

48
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,588
-How does he get the helium?
-How many questions is too many questions?

49
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,349
-Maybe he's not for you.
-Four questions. The answer's four.

50
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,754
Hey, you know who went on a date
the other night? Stuart.

51
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,717
-Oh, good for him.
-I thought so too.

52
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,073
So is she, like, homeless
or framing him for a crime?

53
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,070
He's using some kinda dating app
on his phone.

54
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:02,156
Oh, which one?
Maybe we can get Amy to try it.

55
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,358
I don't know.
Stuart, can you come in here?

56
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,398
He tried to explain it to me.

57
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,751
It shows you pictures of people nearby,
you swipe them around,

58
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,188
it looks kinda like a game.

59
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,114
Oh! And if you lose the game,
you have to go out with Stuart.

60
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,715
(CHUCKLES)

61
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,709
-What's up?
-Can you show us that dating app?

62
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,268
Oh, yeah, sure.

63
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,871
This thing has changed my life.

64
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,151
-Wow! So, how many girls have you met?
-Two.

65
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:32,556
I probably don't need to mention there is
an entire number between that and zero.

66
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,674
Well, so, how does it work?

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,356
Uh, well it shows me all the single women,

68
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:40,868
in afive-mile radius,
who are using the app.

69
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:43,190
lfl like the way they look,
I hit thumbs up.

70
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,589
If I don't, thumbs down.

71
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,792
Oh! What would make you give a girl
a thumbs down?

72
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,191
First time it happens,
lwill let you know.

73
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,948
Oh, hey, ljust heard back
from the liquid helium guy.

74
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:57,314
Oh! What's he say?

75
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,795
He's got what we need,
and can meet us tonight.

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,387

at night.

79
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,159
I went to the Ralphs at 11:30 pm.

80
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:11,315
to pick up Cracklin' Oat Bran
for the morning, and what did I see?

81
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,238
-The man restocking the cereal shelves.
-That's right. And what did he do?

82
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,954
He handed you the box directly
and called you "Stretch."

83
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,552
(SHUDDERS)
It's like it was yesterday.

84
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,709
-Do you want liquid helium or not?
-Of course, I do!

85
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,558
I don't want that
Swedish team scooping us.

86
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:29,317
Well, then, I'm gonna tell him we're in.

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,592
Leonard, wait. This is highly unethical.

88
00:04:31,799 --> 00:04:33,949
Oh! We're just bending the rules a little.

89
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,469
We have grant money to do the experiment,

90
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,636
so we're gonna spend it
on the helium we need.

91
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,310
It's not like when Doctor Goldfarb claimed
he bought an electron microscope,

92
00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:45,511
but he was reallyjust keeping a
Russian girl in an apartment in Van Nuys.

93
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,552
Was she helping him with his research?

94
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,354
Sure.

95
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,068
So, we doing this?

96
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,632
-But where does he get the helium?
-Remember? Don't ask too many questions.

97
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,831
But this is violating university code.

98
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,268

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,115

102
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:15,631
All right, do it. Tell him we're in.

103
00:05:18,239 --> 00:05:19,194
Done.

104
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:22,587
I can't find that quote on the Internet.
Did you make that up?

105
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,798
Before I answer, may I just say,
your skin has never looked better.

I'm not sure, how I feel about this.

00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,639
Oh, come on.
Just let him put the app on your phone.

00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,398
Yeah, Stuart got two dates with it.

had she not said no.

00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,429
You could kill us...

170
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,508
Really, you're only limited
by your imagination.

171
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:36,755
Huh.

172
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,870
All these years,

173
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,310
I've been using "stalemate"
when I really mean "impasse."

174
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,235
| feel foolish.

175
00:08:45,439 --> 00:08:46,838
Eh, I don't think it matters

176
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,474
if this is a stalemate or an impasse
or a Mexican standoff.

177
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,954
What are we gonna do here?

178
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,798
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
How could it be a Mexican standoff?

179
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,910
Everybody knows
you need three sides for that.

180
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,348
Not necessarily.

181
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:59,990
Uh, many argue,
the essence of a Mexican standoff is that

182
00:09:00,199 --> 00:09:03,032
no one can walk away from the conflict
without incurring harm.

183
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,952
Hmm. I don't follow.

184
00:09:06,479 --> 00:09:07,434
Let me give you an example.

185
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,597
Earlier today,
| decoded the headers on your email,

186
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,711
and I know that your name
is Kenneth Fitzgerald.

187
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,388
Now, from that, I figured out
where you live and where you work.

188
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:19,989
Now, to make this a Mexican standoff,
I would say something like,

189
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,392
"You give us the helium,
or I'll turn you in to the authorities."

190
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,720
-Is that a threat?
-Yeah, exactly. See, you're getting it.

191
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,988
Yeah, well, I know where you work,
all right? And if you mess with me,

192
00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:33,713
l'll report you, then,
I'll pound your asses into the ground.

193
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,195
Perfect! Now, we really are
in a Mexican standoff.

194
00:09:39,319 --> 00:09:42,197
Is this one of those times where
I've won the battle but lost the war?

195
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,279
Afraid so, Skippy.

196
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,592
I told you,
we shouldn't go shopping at night.

197
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,631
All right, let's all just calm down.
Nobody wants to report anybody.

198
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:58,954
Nah, I don't like this. I'm out.

199
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:01,190
No, no, no. Wait, don't go.
Just let me explain.

200
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,469
We're physicists,
and we're trying to prove a hypothesis

201
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:06,431
that we've been working on,
for over a year.

202
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:08,636
Really? What's the hypothesis?

203
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,754
Space-time can be interpreted as the
surface of an N-dimensional superfluid.

204
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,115
Hmm. Could be. Could be, go on.

205
00:10:18,999 --> 00:10:20,910
Okay, okay.
But now, there's this Swedish team,

206
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,714
that read our paper and they're trying to
beat us to our own discovery.

207
00:10:24,439 --> 00:10:25,588
We really need this helium.

208
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,998
And I'm sorry! lied about being
a wedding planner who can't find love.

209
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:31,595
Although lam currently single,
if you know anybody.

210
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,192
Here's the money. Can we do this?

211
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:37,434
Okay.

212
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,834
It's a shame about those scientists
ripping you off.

213
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,237
I expected a higher ethical standard
from our friends in Sweden.

214
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:49,552
It's actually pretty common in our field.
Not much you can do about it.

215
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,430
Well, for the right amount of money,
if you know where they live,

216
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:54,072
there's, uh, plenty we could do about it.

217
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,314
Do you hear that, Leonard?
There's plenty we could do about it.

218
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,314
Do you have a card?

219
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,389
Okay, here we go, now everyone can see.

220
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:09,028
All right. (CLEARS THROAT)
Where do we stand on cross-eyed Mike?

Aren't we being a little mean?

231
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,829
That's a fair point.

232
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,550
We wouldn't make fun of someone like this
to their face.

233
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,309
Look, it's Stuart.

234
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,599
You may wanna leave the room.

-Will you stop with that already?
-I am trying not to attract attention.

237

And tipping his hat to the cleaning lady
didn't do that?

238

She said buenas noches.
What was he supposed to do?

239
00:12:22,319 --> 00:12:23,718
Let's just start the experiment.

240
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,520
Leonard, we should probably have our
stories straight in case we get caught.

241
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,709
We're not getting caught.

242
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,399
Well, you can't be sure of that.

243
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,591
What if the helium dealer rats us out?

244
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,557
What if Kripke asks where we got it?

245
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:35,909
What if the university checks
my family tree and finds out,

246
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,599
I don't have an Uncle Harvey?

247
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:41,632
The dealer doesn't care,
Kripke has no authority over us,

248
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,792
and you being related to
a metal container, would explain a lot.

249
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,395
Help me hook this up.

250
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,309
-U h-oh.
-What?

251
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,238
-Well, did you see this sticker?
-What is it?

252
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:53,667
lt's partially torn off,

253
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:57,076
but the segment that remains reads,
"Property of" and the letter "U".

254
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,235
It's probably USC or UCLA.

255
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:01,590
Yeah, but what if it's
"Property of US. Government"?

256
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,273
There's a national helium reserve in
Amarillo, Texas.

257
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:07,551
If this was stolen from there,
we're accessories to a federal crime.

258
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,634
Let's not jump to conclusions.
A lot of things start with U.

259
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,875
That's true. There's the US. Air Force,
US. Department of Defense, US. Navy.

U and l are going tojail.

00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:20,629
Listen, we can do the experiment
as planned

262
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,273
and beat the Swedish team to the punch,

263
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,075

we were too afraid to break a few rules.

-Take your time.

333
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,908
l'll walk out backwards
for a dramatic effect.

334
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,796
I don't like being extorted like this.
Especially by him of all people.

335
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,116
Me neither,
but what other choice do we have?

336
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,072
I promise this is the last time.

337
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,432
It says right here on Wikipedia.

338
00:17:21,639 --> 00:17:24,870
"A Mexican standoff is a confrontation
between at least three parties."

339
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,238
(SCOFFS) How can you trust Wikipedia

340
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,958
if they use "between"
to refer to three parties?

341
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:33,671
They should've used "among," right?

342
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,551
Or "amongst,"
if they were feeling whimsically archaic.

343
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:43,477
Enough with the chitchat. Are we gonna
watch Ernest Goes To Jail or not?

344
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,749
Absolutely.

345
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,838
But don't be surprised if this movie
sets you on the straight and narrow.

346
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,553
lam open to change.

347
00:18:19,959 --> 00:18:20,948
