00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:05,829
Did you hear about this study
that found people

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,277
that were cool and popular at 13
have problems succeeding later in life?

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,591
Hmm. I'm doing okay
and l was very popular at 13.

4
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:13,438
-In school?
-Oh, no, at home.

5
00:00:14,999 --> 00:00:17,593
The servants would sing to me,
laugh at myjokes.

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,199
lwish I knew their names.

7
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:24,988
Does the study say
what happens to the unpopular kids?

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,197
You tell me. You woke up in bed with one.

9
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,796
Listen to this.
ljust received an email from Wil Wheaton.

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,759
Leonard Nimoy's son is working
on a documentary

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,036
that he started with his father
before he passed away.

12
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,549
It's about Mr. Spock
and his impact on our culture.

13
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,195
Why is he writing to you?

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,352
Well, they're looking for fans
to interview

15
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,676
-and Wil thought I'd be good for it.
-Oh. Hey, high five.

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,995
Absolutely not.

17
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,438
Yeah, Penny, you've spent some time
in front of the camera.

18
00:00:52,639 --> 00:00:53,958
Any words of advice?

19
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:56,673
Yes, don't take your shirt off
just because the director said so.

20
00:00:58,319 --> 00:00:59,877
This is a documentary about Mr. Spock.

21
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:01,911
I'm sure if there's nudity
it will be tasteful.

22

Hey, you got a minute?

Not really.
Visigoths are kinda up my butt right now.

26

'Sup?

29
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,557
We need to talk about
redecorating this place.

30
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,477
(SIGHS) No, not this again.

31
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:54,074
(SIGHS) Look, | get that you grew up here,

32
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,549
and you're attached to things
looking a certain way,

33
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,751
but I want this to feel like
my house, too.

34
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,872
(CHUCKLING) Oh. Honey,
of course it's your house.

35
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,432
Why else would you be cleaning it
all the time?

36
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,955
(CHUCKLES)

37
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,312
All right, let's start over.

38
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,752
l'm redecorating.
The furniture, the carpeting, the walls.

39
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,554
l'm changing everything that depresses me
when I look at it.

40
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,352
Try not to be one of those things.

41
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,193
May I say something?

42
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,992
Is it about howl can't have new wallpaper

43
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:23,195
'cause your dad left
when you were little and your mom died?

44
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:24,754
Never mind.

45
00:02:28,359 --> 00:02:29,758
Hello, Amy. lt's Sheldon.

46
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:33,071
Yeah, I know that we're broken up but
I'm leaving this message because

47
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,669
I thought perhaps
you'd like to watch me be interviewed

48
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,677
for a documentary about Mr. Spock.

49
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:41,111
Or as I like to call it, a Spockumentary.
(LAUGHS)

50
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,036
Yeah, I'm going to use that joke
in the interview,

51
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,071
so try to laugh
like you're hearing it for the first time.

52
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,268
You know, hysterically.

53
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,229
And with a tinge of sadness
that I'm no longer in your life.

54
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:54,471
I'm the one who thought of Spockumentary.

55
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,837
And I'm laughing like I did
the first time I heard it.

56
00:02:57,999 --> 00:02:59,114
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

57
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,839
-Hello.
-Hey, Sheldon.

58
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,758
-This is Adam Nimoy.
-Nice to meet you.

59
00:03:04,999 --> 00:03:06,478
Oh, it's nice to meet you.

60
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,710
I admire your father's work very much.

61
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,318
It's not every day | get to meet someone

62
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:12,669
whose life's journey began
in my hero's scrotum.

63
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,152
I told you, this guy is gold.

64
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:24,354
Whatcha doing?

65
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:25,998
Oh. Making myself a bologna sandwich

66
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,158
like my mom used to make me
after my dad left but before she died.

67
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,076
Okay, listen, I'm thinking that maybe
we can compromise on the house.

68
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,354
I'm listening.

69
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,109
Let's just redo one room
and see how it goes.

70
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:45,353
That is reasonable, but what room?

71
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,310
-How about this one?
-No way, no.

72
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,229
This is the room
| associate the most with my mom.

73
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:54,677
-Then how about the bathroom?
-I wanna change my answer.

74
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,751
Fine, then the dining room.

75
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,553
I guess we didn't use it very often.
Unless we had company.

76
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,354
Which didn't happen much after
my dad left but not at all after my mom--

77
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,198
Great, I'm gonna go
pick out paint samples.

78
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:12,317
All right.
We're just gonna have a conversation,

79
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:13,793
pretend the camera's not here.

80
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:15,394
All right.

81
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:18,438
But this better not be some elaborate
scheme to get me out of my shirt.

82
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:23,155
-How long have you known Adam?
-A few years.

83
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:26,234
-And what are you getting him back for?
-(CHUCKLES)

84
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,192
Let's start with your name and occupation.

85
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,030
Doctor Sheldon Cooper,
Theoretical Physicist, Caltech.

86
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:36,358
ADAM: And what is your earliest memory
of the character Spock?

87
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,308
The ﬁrst episode of
Star Trek: The Original Series Ieversaw

88
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,112
was The Galileo Seven.

89
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,273
Uh, Spock had just landed on the planet
Taurus II.

90
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,070
Then my brother came in, sat on my head
and said, "Eat farts. "

91
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,672
After that day I was hooked.

92
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,556
On Star Trek,
not my brother's sphincter-based cuisine.

93
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,635
What was it about Spock
that appealed to you?

94
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:05,594
I think the same thing that
appeals to people everywhere.

95
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,357
The dream of a cold rational world
entirely without human emotion.

96
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,400
Spock came from a planet
governed only by logic.

97
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,630
You know, on Vulcan,
when your brother asks,

98
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,035
"Why are you hitting yourself?"
The answer is,

99
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,834
"I'm not. You're moving my arm. "

100
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,398
To which he says, "Fascinating."

101
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:27,995
And then you both watch
educational television.

102
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:33,270
Oh. When he says things like that ljust
wanna hug him and make everything better.

103
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,559
-My brother was mean to me, too.
-Yeah, you probably had it coming.

104
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,431
Do you have any Spock collectibles?

105
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,795
I have many.

106
00:05:41,999 --> 00:05:44,274
My most treasured is an autographed napkin

107
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,549
given to me
by my very thoughtful friend, Penny.

108
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,829
That's her over there.

109
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:52,034
Hi.

110
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,599
(CHUCKLES) Look at that, I'm in a movie,
my shirt stayed on.

111
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:00,309
-Can we see the napkin?
-Of course.

112
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,192
Excuse me. This will just take a moment.

113
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,479
When did we get a wall safe?

114
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,392
When there was no more room
in the floor safe.

115
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,432
When did we get a floor safe?

116
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,072
When we got the security camera.

117
00:06:25,679 --> 00:06:27,237
There's a security camera?

118
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,348
Aquaman. Protecting your home since 2012.

119
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,111
Oh, my God,
we've done things on that couch.

120
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,548
Yeah, you don't have to tell me.

121
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:43,031
So, your father-in-law
is in there right now?

122
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,310
Yes, so back me up.
The house is good the way it is.

123
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:46,634
Okay. Got it.

124
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,671
-Hey, what's going on?
-Hey.

125
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,592
Hey, Raj, Dad and lwerejust
talking about taking down this wall.

126
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,669
You sure? It's a pretty great wall.

127
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:58,992
What's so great about it?

128
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,513
I'm sorry, I did what I could.

129
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,876
Seriously? You brought Raj over
to take your side?

130
00:07:06,119 --> 00:07:07,347
Your dad's on your side.

131
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:09,869
He's not on my side.
He's doing all the work for free.

132
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,756
That is so generous of you.

133
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,995
I'd like to switch sides.

134
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,351
Look, I don't even think you can take
this wall down 'cause it's load-bearing.

135
00:07:20,799 --> 00:07:23,836
Well, it's easy to find out, just go into
the crawlspace under the house and check.

136
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,839
When is your visa up?

137
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,392
Not only is it signed to me,

138
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,555
but this is where he wiped his mouth.

139
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,230
So, we are currently in the presence
of Leonard Nimoy's DNA.

140
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:40,639
Um, doesn't Adam count
as Leonard Nimoy's DNA?

141
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,958
No offense,
but this is pure 100 percent Nimoy.

142
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,390
Now, because of your mother,
you're only 50 percent.

143
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,430
Which isn't bad, but anything that
you wipe your mouth on gets thrown away.

144
00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:56,955
Okay, enough about the napkin.
What else you hiding in there?

145
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,639
-Wouldn't you like to know.
-I would.

146
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,955
Yeah, all right, then.

147
00:08:00,559 --> 00:08:04,347
See, it's just my valuables.
My passport, my will.

148
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,352
-You have a will?
-Yeah, my one-eighteenth scale

149
00:08:06,559 --> 00:08:07,708
Wil Wheaton action figure.

150
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:13,630
Yeah, I also have the other kind of will.
And in it I will my Wil back to Wil.

151
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,393
-Wi|| Wil want it?
-Wil won't.

152
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,790
-What's that ring box?
-Oh, that is an engagement ring,

153
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,792
that I was going to give
my girlfriend Amy.

154
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,035
What?

155
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,468
You bought her a ring?

156
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,636
No, no, no, this has been in my family
for generations.

157
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:33,433
No, except for a short time when Comanches

158
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:36,028
cut off my great-great-great
grandmother's ﬁnger and stole it.

159
00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:38,307
Sheldon, that's awful.

160
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,953
No, the Texas Rangers
tracked them down to their village

161
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,593
and slaughtered every last one of them.

162
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:44,868
It was a happy ending.

163
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,553
Well, for my nine-ﬁngered nana.

164
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,549
Okay, back to the ring.
Does Amy even know about this?

165
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:54,791
No, she broke up with me
before I could broach the subject.

166
00:08:55,079 --> 00:08:56,990
Man, I'm sorry.
That must've been devastating for you.

167
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,395
No, not at all. No, I'm fine.

168
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,750
You know, Amy had reservations
about our relationship

169
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,108
so all worked out for the best.

170
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,839
-I know, it'sjust--
-I said I'm fine!

171
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,439
We've gotten a little off topic.

172
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:16,674
Allow me to make things entertaining again
in this little Spockumentary.

173
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:22,953
That was Leonard's joke.

174
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:33,073
As a child, when faced with a dilemma,

175
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,238
my mother encouraged me to ask,
"What would Jesus do?"

176
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,439
The answer to that was always,
"Love thy neighbor. "

177
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:42,637
But my neighbor had a dead tooth,

178
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,598
so that wasn't going to happen.

179
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,949
But that's why I changed it to,
"What would Spock do?"

180
00:09:52,479 --> 00:09:53,434
Did you find that helpful?

181
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,955
Yes. No, for example, three years ago

182
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,549
when I discovered
Penny was eating all my Pop-Tarts,

183
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,713
instead of getting angry or vindictive,
you know, I got a floor safe.

184
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,673
I knew I could smell 'em.

185
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:09,753
-What about from when you were a kid?
-Oh, certainly.

186
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,434
Uh, when I was eight years old,

187
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,716
Billy Sparks cornered me
in the playground.

188
00:10:13,999 --> 00:10:15,876
I asked myself, "What would Spock do?"

189
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,750
Then I grabbed Billy on his shoulder
and performed my ﬁrst Vulcan nerve pinch.

190
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:25,235
-Did it work?
-Oh, no, he broke my collarbone.

191
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,358
Yeah, I can still hear it click.

192
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,392
That must have been
very upsetting for you.

193
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:34,637
Oh, not at all. As I said,

194
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,235
the entire point of emulating Spock
was to rise above human emotion,

195
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:40,316
which I've spent a lifetime mastering.

196
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,635
Oh. (BLOWS RASPBERRY)

197
00:10:43,719 --> 00:10:46,108
-Excuse me?
-l'm sorry, I'm not here.

198
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,715
No, you went... (BLOWS RASPBERRY)
What does... (BLOWS RASPBERRY) Mean?

199
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,591
-Uh...
-You did go... (BLOWS RASPBERRY)

200
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,635
Okay, fine.

201
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,998
Sheldon, I'm no expert, but aren't you
completely missing the point of Spock?

202
00:10:57,319 --> 00:11:00,152
He liked to act like he had no emotions,
but he was still half-human.

203
00:11:00,439 --> 00:11:01,508
Just like you.

204
00:11:02,999 --> 00:11:04,227
I'm just saying, you pretend you don't,

205
00:11:04,439 --> 00:11:06,077
but you have feelings
just like everybody else.

206
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:08,271
Not true. No, look at me.

207
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,995
I had an engagement ring to give a girl,
and instead she rejected me.

208
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,350
And am | emotional about that? No.

209
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,073
No, lam sitting here on a couch

210
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,589
talking about my favorite TV character
like nothing happened.

211
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,360
'Cause I am just like him.
All logical, all the time.

212
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,035
-Sweetie, you're yelling.
-Because when I speak at a regular volume

213
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,118
no one seems to believe me that
I've put this Amy nonsense behind me.

214
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:30,794
(DOOR SLAMS)

215
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,156
This documentary is gonna be awesome.

216
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,876
-You gonna be okay down here?
-Yeah.

217
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,479
| feel like an archaeologist.

218
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:45,153
Indiana Jones
and the Single Family Dwelling.

219
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,951
Hey. Look. Found a seashell.

220
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,592
-Yeah, that's a rat skull.
-Oh!

221
00:11:54,439 --> 00:11:57,954
Relax, there's enough droppings down here
without you making more.

222
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,673
Sorry. You have a sense of where we are?

223
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,356
-Yeah, I think that's the den.
-Oh.

224
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:06,875
Okay. So we must be under the dining room.

225
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,590
Uh-huh. Yep. You know,
I know you don't wanna hear this,

226
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,394
but it wouldn't take that much work
to turn that den into a nursery.

227
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,915
-Oh, why wouldn't I wanna hear it?
-'Cause Bernie said you didn't want kids.

228
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:21,112
That's not true at all.

229
00:12:21,319 --> 00:12:24,038
Well, lwish she'd get pregnant.
Believe me.

230
00:12:24,439 --> 00:12:27,192
l'm climbing on top of her
every chance I get.

231
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:28,834
(EXHALES)

232
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,870
In a loving and respectful manner.

233
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:34,156
Oh. (CLEARS THROAT)

234
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,956
The point is I really do want kids.

235
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,995
Huh.

236
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,352
I don't know why she's lying to you.

237
00:12:42,719 --> 00:12:44,232
She's the one who doesn't want kids.

238
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,589
In fact, every time I bring up the subject
she's always~

239
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,119
Earthquake!

240
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,636
Oh, my God. We're gonna die.

241
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,399
Aftershock!

242
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:01,234
I can't believe Sheldon was gonna ask
Amy to marry him.

243
00:13:01,439 --> 00:13:02,349
I know.

244
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,472
I also can't believe he watched what
we did on that couch and still sits on it.

245
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:06,754
Yeah.

246
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,832
-Hello.
-Hey, buddy, how you doing?

247
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,995
Better.

248
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,913
-Did Wil and Adam leave?
-Yeah.

249
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,474
Do you think they're going to
put my outburst in the documentary?

250
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:18,873
-Oh, yeah.
-Definitely.

251
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:22,795
Well, there's no point dwelling on it.

252
00:13:23,319 --> 00:13:24,434
As the Vulcans say...

253
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,118
(SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)

254
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,956
-Do you know what that means?
-No.

255
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,348
Are you telling the truth?

256
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,955
(SPEAKS OTHER LANGUAGE)

257
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,793
Well, this is ridiculous.

258
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,873
Being upset about Amy all the time
isn't accomplishing anything.

259
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,959
If I wanna resolve this situation
then I need to take action.

260
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,753
-What are you gonna do?
-l'm going to find her

261
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,028
and ask her to marry me.

262
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:49,716
And if she says yes we can put this
behind us and resume our relationship.

263
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,869
If she says no, well then she can just...
(SPEAKS OTHER LANGUAGE)

264
00:13:57,759 --> 00:13:58,953
He didn't mean that.

265
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,750
So, I should probably explain
whyl kinda fibbed.

266
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,638
That would be nice.

267
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:16,149
I told my dad that you were the one
who didn't want kids

268
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,753
because I didn't wanna disappoint him.

269
00:14:17,999 --> 00:14:20,308
But you were okay
throwing me under the bus?

270
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:22,717
Turns out, yeah,
I didn't think twice about it.

271
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,996
Bernie, you don't need to worry about me.

272
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,636
But I don't wanna see you miss out.

273
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:33,468
Raising children was the most
rewarding experience of my life.

274
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,029
Oh, please.

275
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,753
Mom did everything, all you did was

276
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,951
come home from work,
sit on the couch and drink beer.

277
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,752
How is that raising kids?

278
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,355
This is really a conversation
for husband and wife. (CHUCKLES)

279
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,670
I'm gonna go clean up, hit the road.

280
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:49,995
If your mother asks,
I was here till 10:00.

281
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,915
It's interesting.
Your father didn't help around the house

282
00:14:56,239 --> 00:14:58,070
and Howard doesn't help either,

283
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,393
so in a way,
Howard's not only like your father

284
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,029
but he's also like the child
that you're afraid to have.

285
00:15:06,719 --> 00:15:08,152
Why are you still here?

286
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,193
Fine, I'll leave. But it sounds like
somebody needs a fresh diaper.

287
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,915
All right.

288
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:23,314
ladmit...

289
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,557
That I don't help out a lot. (CHUCKLES)

290
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,479
And I need to work on that.

291
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,718
But if we had a kid,
it would be different.

292
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,919
-Why?
-Because...

293
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:36,631
When my dad left,
I promised myself that...

294
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,631
If I ever had a chance to be a father...

295
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,114
I'd always be there.

296
00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:47,032
Okay, I'll think about it.

297
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,198
And this is an actual
"I'll think about it?"

298
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,074
Not like the "Can we get a motorcycle
with a sidecar?

299
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,274
"I'll think about it?"

300
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,229
-lt's an actual "I'll think about it."
-And I really believe I'd be a great dad.

301
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:03,197
-I know you would.
-(CHUCKLES)

302
00:16:04,439 --> 00:16:06,316
Speaking of making babies,

303
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,393
what do you say I wash up
and poke around your crawlspace?

304
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:21,274
(INAUDIBLE)

305
00:16:41,719 --> 00:16:43,755
Dr. Dehner feels he isn't that dangerous.

306
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,712
What makes you right
and a trained psychiatrist wrong?

307
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,316
Because she feels. I don't.
All I know is logic.

308
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,595
(SCOFFS) Yeah, right.

309
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,998
You can just shut your feelings off.

310
00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:56,190
There goes television, lying to us again.

311
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,153
We let you raise our children
and this is the thanks we get?

312
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:02,956
Leonard, how could I have been so foolish?

313
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,068
To try and follow in the footsteps of a
made-up alien race with no emotions?

314
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,919
(EXHALES) Well...

315
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,674
Now instead of idolizing
fictional characters,

316
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,519
you can focus on the real people
who are already in your life.

317
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,435
Those are very

318
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,678
-wise words.
-Thank you.

319
00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:22,832
They'd just be so much more comforting
if they came out of a television.
