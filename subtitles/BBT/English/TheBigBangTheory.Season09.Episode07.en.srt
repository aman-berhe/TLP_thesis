PENNY: Previously on
The Big Bang Theory...

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,512
Well, there's no point dwelling on it.

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,192
As the Vulcans say...

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:09,152
(SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,715
-Do you know what that means?
-No.

6
00:00:13,959 --> 00:00:15,233
You telling the truth?

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,793
(SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,275
Well, this is ridiculous.

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,358
Being upset about Amy all the time
isn't accomplishing anything.

10
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:25,107
If I wanna resolve this situation,
then I need to take action.

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,515
What are you gonna do?

12
00:00:26,799 --> 00:00:28,835
I'm going to find her
and ask her to marry me.

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,315
And if she says yes, we can put this
behind us and resume our relationship.

14
00:00:32,519 --> 00:00:36,307
If she says no, well, then she can just...
(SPEAKS OTHER LANGUAGE)

15
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,508
He didn't mean that.

16
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:48,514
(INAUDIBLE)

17
00:01:04,759 --> 00:01:07,319
I think it's so adorable
you're making Sheldon breakfast.

18
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,033
Well, he's having a rough time.

19
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,309
Amy broke his heart,

20
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,239
the DVR cut off the last minute
of Doctor Who.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,797
That crow followed him home.

22
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:20,313
Aren't you worried you're making
French toast on oatmeal day?

23
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,034
Oh? Well, what's this? A pot of oatmeal?

24
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,590
Or thanks to you, what I will
now call "gloatmeal"? (CHUCKLES)

25
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,350
Oh, I don't want credit for that.

26
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,039
Dr. and Mrs. Hofstadter,
lovely to see you this fine morning.

27
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,357
-You're in a good mood.
-I am indeed.

28
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:39,990
I have decided, instead of
wallowing in sadness about Amy,

29
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:42,787
it is time that I find myself
a new female companion.

30
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,475
-Ah, good for you.
-What brought this on?

31
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,075
I realized something.
When Amy was in my life,

32
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,118
I was hyper-focused on my work
and ignored her.

33
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,476
And you don't want to make the same
mistake with the next woman?

34
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,791
No, I need a new woman
in my life to ignore,

35
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,990
so I can hyper-focus on my work again.

36
00:01:58,839 --> 00:02:00,158
Hey, I made French toast sticks.

37
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:03,317
-On oatmeal day?
-Ah, I also made oatmeal.

38
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,956
Oh, that's a lot of carbohydrates
for a man on the prowl.

39
00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:08,951
You know what? You eat it, you're married.

40
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,872
It doesn't matter what you look like.

41
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:15,756
Don't take advice from a man
who threw his shoe at a crow.

42
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,113
(THEME SONG PLAYING)

43
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,794
-Thank you for coming by, gentlemen.
-No problem.

44
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:46,352
So, what's up?

45
00:02:46,559 --> 00:02:49,198
It was the two of you
who found Amy Farrah Fowler for me.

46
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,317
Now that I'm looking
for my next girlfriend,

47
00:02:51,559 --> 00:02:54,437
it seemed only logical
that I employ your services once again.

48
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:57,194
You sure you're up for that?
She did hurt you.

49
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,439
Oh, no, it's all right. |think of my time
with Amy as a stick of Fruit Stripe gum.

50
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:06,270
Sweet and enjoyable at first, but
ultimately a flavorless lump of sadness.

51
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,028
You're not wrong about Fruit Stripe.
I was always a Hubba Bubba man.

52
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,995
Hubba Bubba over Dubble Bubble?
You're crazy.

53
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:18,437
Hey, the jaw wants what it wants.

54
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,034
Gentlemen!

55
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,272
Oh, right. Uh, girlfriend.

56
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:24,072
(STAMMERS) What are you looking for?

57
00:03:24,399 --> 00:03:28,278
All I'm looking for is an educated,
intelligent woman who shares my interests,

58
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,277
while retaining
her own unique point of view.

59
00:03:30,559 --> 00:03:33,198
She should be kind, patient,
and most important,

60
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,670
unable to imagine life without me
by 10 o'clock tonight.

61
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,992
Isn't that a little unreasonable?

62
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:43,348
Ah, fine. She doesn't need her own
point of view. Now, chop chop.

63
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:47,109
Come on, Amy! Show us the dress!

64
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:50,790
AMY: Okay, but I'm really stepping outside
of my comfort zone here.

65
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:59,034
Uh...

66
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,953
I don't think any of your comfort zones
are showing.

67
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:05,550
It's your third date,
maybe you could go more sexy.

68
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:08,752
Well, some people think
the sexiest organ is the brain.

69
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,874
No one ever bought me drinks at a bar

70
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:12,990
because my brain just
popped out of my shirt.

71
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,199
Do you have any heels higher than this?
He's pretty tall.

72
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,798
Ooh, tall! Finally some details
about this mystery man.

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,228
Yeah, come on. Tell us more.

74
00:04:22,599 --> 00:04:25,750
Well, I told you his name and that
he's tall. What more do you need?

75
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,277
-Did you kiss him yet?
-Just a little peck on the lips.

76
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:30,434
(BOTH SQUEAL)

77
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,274
Well, we're your best friends.

78
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,596
Give us one more detail
and we promise we'll leave you alone.

79
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,992
Fine. Um, he's British.

80
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,154
(BOTH SQUEAL)

81
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,234
(CHUCKLING)
All right, that is ajuicy one!

82
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,950
All right, where's
Tall British Dave taking you?

83
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,474
Tea and basketball?

84
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,398
-To that new Italian place on Walnut.
-Oh, nice.

85
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,392
-l'm gonna go look for other shoes.
-Oh, good luck.

86
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,393
I threw out all my ta|| ones
when I married Leonard.

87
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,273
Hey, you wanna swing by that place
tonight and get a look at this guy?

88
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,638
We don't even know what time
they're gonna be there.

89
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,428
I'll just call the restaurant, pretend
I'm Amy and check the reservation.

90
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:10,591
Damn, you're sneaky.

91
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,792
Yeah, but I'm little, so it's adorable.

92
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,276
I think the quickest way
to find you a new girlfriend

93
00:05:18,559 --> 00:05:21,869
is just to get you on
every dating website out there.

94
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:24,674
Are you sure?
I've heard that on those sites,

95
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:26,790
often when you think
you're corresponding with someone,

96
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,917
it's actually a computer program
pretending to be a real person.

97
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:32,918
And you're afraid
it'll do a betterjob than you?

98
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,910
Excuse me, no one does a betterjob
pretending to be a person than I do.

99
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,119
Siri comes close, but I know more jokes.

100
00:05:43,119 --> 00:05:45,792
Well, if you don't want to use
dating websites, what do you suggest?

101
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,269
Off the top of my head?

102
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,358
Prospective women
weed themselves out in a battle of wits

103
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,118
until only one champion remains,

104
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,869
she shows up at my door
flush with the thrill of victory,

105
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,277
and then sits quietly by my side
while I watch Daredevil.

106
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:02,030
You seriously think women
would fight for you?

107
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:05,113
People compete forjobs and trophies,
why not me?

108
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:08,191
He's right. He knows a lot ofjokes.

109
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,034
No, but it is basic human nature.

110
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,514
If we present him as a prize,
maybe they would.

111
00:06:16,239 --> 00:06:18,912
Well, he's smart,
he's a respected scientist.

112
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:22,477
And I have the soulful eyes of a cow.

113
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,390
-(SCOFFS)
-I don't know if I'd say you... Oh.

114
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,030
I have an idea. What if we put
a post on Craigslist that says,

115
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,073
"World-class Caltech physicist
seeking girlfriend.

116
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:40,438
"If interested, solve the following
puzzles for a chance to meet him."

117
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:42,357
Oh, we'll make the puzzles
extremely challenging

118
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,231
to eliminate unworthy candidates.

119
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,192
Oh, we can set it up like a scavenger hunt

120
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,472
where the last puzzle gives the winner
Sheldon's contact information.

121
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,718
This is actually
an interesting social experiment.

122
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,958
I'm a little jealous of the people
who get to do it.

123
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,032
Me, too, and we've seen the prize!

124
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,876
I don't understand why we're leaving
so early for the movie?

125
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:04,956
Oh, I forgot to tell you,
we're gonna meet up with Bernadette

126
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,679
to spy on Amy and her date. (CHUCKLES)

127
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,718
What? I don't wanna do that.

128
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,191
And you think I wanna see a documentary
about aluminum can recycling?

129
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:16,036
This is the movie that Big Soda
doesn't want you to see.

130
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,434
Yeah, it's the movie
your wife doesn't want you to see.

131
00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:23,991
So, you're actually okay with invading
your friend's privacy?

132
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:27,317
-You're not curious who she's outwith?
-Not really.

133
00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:29,755
But you're curious about aluminum cans.

134
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:33,671
You're a weird little guy.

135
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,796
That's it. The Sheldon Cooper
Girlfriend Challenge is officially live.

136
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:41,909
(CHUCKLES)

137
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:43,552
-Congratu|ations.
-This is exciting.

138
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,795
Right now, somewhere,

139
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,072
a woman is dividing the atomic weight
of the best noble gas

140
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,192
by the number of colors
in the oldest national flag still in use--

141
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:53,276
Then using that number as
the average speed to calculate

142
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,198
-the travel time from Mordor to the Shire.
-(CHUCKLES)

143
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:58,551
And taking her first step towards
a lifetime of laughter,

144
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,320
love and best of all, rules.

145
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:04,554
I hope we didn't make
the puzzles too hard.

146
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:07,991
Well, if she can solve them,
it'll prove she's intelligent,

147
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,156
tenacious and so socially awkward,

148
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:11,957
she has nothing better to do
on a Saturday night.

149
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,155
(LAUGHING)

150
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:16,350
Golly, she sounds too good to be true.

151
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:22,271
This is fun.
I haven't dated much since my divorce.

152
00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:24,390
Well, I'm having a good time, too.

153
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,473
If you don't mind me asking,
why did you and your wife split up?

154
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,955
Oh, you know how it is,
we wanted different things.

155
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,715
I wanted children, and she wanted
a pastry chef named "Jean-Philippe".

156
00:08:35,319 --> 00:08:36,718
-Oh, I'm so sorry.
-lt's fine.

157
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,037
It's why! left England.
It reminded me too much of her.

158
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,513
Cold, gloomy, and easily accessed by
a Frenchman through a tunnel.

159
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:50,388
-Hey. So, where are they?
-Across the street, in the left window.

160
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:53,477
Oh, damn it,
we should have brought binoculars.

161
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,239
Right here.

162
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,232
You just happen to have those in the car?

163
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,990
Kind of. Before I met Howie, I liked to
keep close tabs on my boyfriends.

164
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,713
By stalking them?

165
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,432

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,589
Yeah.

Can I see?

170
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,470
What? Now you're interested?
You didn't even want to come.

171
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,632
I know, but you guys make
being a crappy friend look fun.

172
00:09:22,439 --> 00:09:23,474
Fine.

173
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,433

00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:29,592
It looks like they're having a nice time.
lwish I could hear what they're saying.

175
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:31,551
Yeah, I should have brought
my parabolic microphone.

-Your what?
-Nothing. Not important.

177
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,275
So, you've never been married?

178
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:41,435
No. To be completely honest, I've only
been in one long-term relationship.

179
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:44,115
-What happened with that?
-That's a good question.

180
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:51,870
After five years, it was just feeling like
more work than it should be.

181
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:54,309
That's too bad.
Was he a neurobiologist like you?

182
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,632
No, he's a theoretical physicist
at CalTech.

183
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:02,668
I love teaching math,
but that would be my dream job.

184
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,153
What's his focus?

185
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,516
Um, it used to be string theory,
now it's dark matter.

186
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,598
But let's not discuss Sheldon,
let's get back to you.

Dr. Sheldon Cooper?

00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,473
I'm trying not to.

189
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,115

190
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,552
No, but I've followed his work for years.
He's a rock star.

191
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,428
You've got to tell me about him.
What's he like?

192
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,669
He really seems into her.

193
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,830
I took a video.
| forgot how much fun this is.

194
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:40,714
Okay, we saw them.
Can we go catch the movie?

-I had to, we're married now.

197
00:10:45,999 --> 00:10:47,034
Ah, I hear that.

198
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:55,231
I'm sorry,
just one more question about Sheldon.

199
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,509
Sure, why not?

200
00:10:57,879 --> 00:10:59,676
It's more of a four-part question, really.

201
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,995
When he wrote his paper on supersingular
prime numbers, how long did it take?

202
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,830
Um, about an hour and a half.

203
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,995
Wow!

204
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,078
I mean... Wow!
And you were there to see it?

205
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,556
Yes. Yeah, we were on a date.

206
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,754
Very much like this one.

207
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,238
I doubt it was like this one.
I mean, he's a genius.

208
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,839
And I wasn't even smart enough

209
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,032
to figure out why
my wife always smelled of croissants.

210
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,432
What was the rest of your question?

211
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,075
-Do you think you can introduce me to him?
-Rea||y?

212
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,635
You want me to introduce you
to my ex-boyfriend?

213
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,792
You're right, it's weird.

214
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:40,034
No, wait. Do it.

215
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,399
No, I changed my mind, I'd be too nervous.

216
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,912
Oh! I don't know what to do!

217
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,475
Are we gonna be much longer?
I really have to go to the bathroom.

218

221

this was still a fun experiment.

we blew up grapes in the microwave.

Maybe you don't want someone
exactly like you.

226
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:19,115
You know what they say, opposites attract.

227
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,434
By that logic, I should be with someone
short, dull, and needy.

228

Not to cast dispersions, but I can't shake
a stick around here without hitting that.

229
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,878
You know, I once drove 500 miles
to hear him speak at Stanford.

230
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:42,709
-l have a DVD of that lecture.
-Rea||y? Wasn't it great?

Well, the next time you watch it,

I'm the bloke who asked the question
that he said was stupid and obvious.

234
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:55,834
It was the nicest thing
he said to anyone there.

235
00:12:56,719 --> 00:13:00,314
That's, um, terrific. Listen, um,
I'm kind of tired. Can we call it a night?

00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:04,713
Oh, gosh. Sorry, ljust spent the whole
night talking about your ex-boyfriend.

-l'm such an idiot.
-No, you're not.

Well, maybe not an idiot.

00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,277
But certainly not as smart as...

00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:17,716
