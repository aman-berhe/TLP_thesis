So we're gonna have a lot of fun today.

27
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,478
I thought we'd start by me asking
them some embarrassing questions.

28
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,671
And then we'll open up some
to the audience

29

(ALL LAUGHING)

35
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,876
David Saltzberg,
who is our science consultant rock star,

36
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,229
who makes sure that everything is correct

37
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:08,035
and still gets a thousand
hateful e-mails a day for...

38
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,753
-(ALL LAUGHING)
-Um...

39
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,476
You were really nervous about the topic
of Leonard and Sheldon's paper, correct?

40
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,153
DAVID SALTZBERG: That's right.

41
00:02:16,359 --> 00:02:17,951
KUNAL NAYYAR: Can you tell us why?

42
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,988
The writers asked me to come up with a
discovery for Sheldon and Leonard

43
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,270
and it would have to be
a signiﬁcant discovery.

44
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,635
So I, I thought about it quite a bit

45
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,434
and we came up
with something related to

46
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,950
superﬂuid vacuum theory
and the space-time of the universe

47
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,593
and I added a little bit,

48
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:35,834
which I thought was kind of cool,

49
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,476
about surface tension,
which had not really been used before.

50
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,352
So I thought this was really, pretty good.

51
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,512
And I, and I submitted it.

52
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,472
And I get the scripts, you know,

53
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:47,277
each time a few more pages,

54
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:49,197
and the next time I got the script,

55
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,153
[saw that one of the people in the show

56
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,318
who will be reading the script
was Professor Stephen Hawking.

57
00:02:57,799 --> 00:03:00,074
At which point,
I had a little bit of a panic attack.

58
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,191
(ALL LAUGHING)

59
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,437
My fear was that
he would look at the script

60
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:09,552
and say, "I'm sorry,
I actually can't agree to be in the show, "

61
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,113
which luckily didn't happen.

62
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,072
On the upside,
I was hoping he would think

63
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:15,235
it's a brilliant idea and write a paper.

64
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:17,236
Um, I'm still waiting for that.

65
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:18,918
(ALL LAUGHING)

66
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,193
Funny, quick story about Stephen Hawking.

67
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,960
When Stephen Hawking
came on set for the ﬁrst time,

68
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,758
uh, he came to watch a run-through

69
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:28,109
and Simon Helberg, Wolowitz,

70
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,074
had to do the voice
in the scene in front of Stephen Hawking.

71
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,395
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

72
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,033
And all of us are doing the scene,

73
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:38,436
but we're secretly looking at Stephen
Hawking from the corner of our eye

74
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:41,358
to see how he would respond
and he was, uh,

75
00:03:41,559 --> 00:03:43,789
-he was smiling, he was loving it!
-He loved it.

76
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,634
CHUCK LORRE: Should I tell the time...
I directed the ﬁrst scene

77
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:49,877
with Stephen Hawking and Sheldon

78
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:52,675
and there was no
weirder moment in your life

79
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,394
when you look
at Professor Hawking and say, "Action. "

80
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,555
(ALL LAUGHING)

81
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:05,469
Again, Stephen Hawking
has a good sense of humor.

82
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,636
NAYYAR: Yeah, you're lucky
he has a good sense of humor.

83
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,519
Last season, we heard Amy's fan ﬁction

84
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:12,437
and I just want to know
what inspired that.

85
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,791
We had become aware
that there was quite a bit

86
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:20,190
of Big Bang Theory
fan ﬁction out there in the world.

87
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,193
And one day
in the writers' room, we looked it up

88
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:24,434
and started reading it...

89
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,074
So, I mean, is there gonna be any
Koothrappali fan ﬁction

90
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,429
or anything like that?

91
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,392
Wouldn't that be amazing?

(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

93
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,637
I think that might be a better
question for the woman who plays Amy.

94
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,398
Ah! You wanna ask her?

95
00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:41,989
Hey, Mayim, you wanna come out
and answer that question for us?

Well, a partial answer.

164
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,759
You know, from the actor's point of view,
in all honesty,

165
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,191
we don't get the scripts
until the night before.

166
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:39,549
So we tape on a Tuesday night
in front of a live audience

167
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,119
and Tuesday night we get the script

168
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,157
that we're gonna start on Wednesday.

169
00:08:43,359 --> 00:08:45,350
And it's really exciting,
and to be completely honest,

170
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,109
almost nine years in, every Tuesday
night still feels like Christmas.

171
00:08:49,319 --> 00:08:52,709
Because you open the script
and, in the ﬁrst few seasons,

172
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:55,228
it was like, "Okay,
how many scenes am I in?" You know?

00:08:55,439 --> 00:08:59,227
And now it's really become,
like, "What's happening in the story?"

174
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:01,395
And that's a testament
to how these characters have grown

175
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,670
and how incredible these writers are.

DAVID GOETSCH: Sometimes lunch is late.

178
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,110
It's terrible.

179
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:17,196
MOLARO: I think one
of the biggest challenges for us

180
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,549
is that any of those episodes

181
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:22,638
where there are big, heavy, uh, moments,

182
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:26,309
like, when Sheldon told Amy
"I love you" for the ﬁrst time

183
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:27,474
or these kinds of things.

184
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,558
So, we, you know,
we care about these characters deeply

185
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:35,311
and it's very important to us
that we get those kind of moments right.

186
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:41,152
And I think that's when the stress levels
probably raises up to the highest,

187
00:09:41,359 --> 00:09:43,873
when we're in the middle
of those kind of scenes.

188
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,036
But there's also the challenge
I think in writing comedy,

189
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,277
which is you want characters
to do bold, funny things,

190
00:09:49,479 --> 00:09:52,391
but you have to show that
the bold funny things are reasonable.

191
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,878
You have to show that it's the reasonable
next step in the progression

192
00:09:57,079 --> 00:09:58,751
and sometimes that can be difﬁcult.

193
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,632
And ifyou don't do it right,
then the characters just seem crazy.

I have a question for you guys, then.

195
00:10:03,199 --> 00:10:05,667
When you're pitching jokes in the room,

196
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,235
do you pitch them as the characters?

-Yeah.

-No, really. Really, only for you.

I know Bill does
'cause Bill has a good Indian accent.

201
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,357
So you pitch the jokes in the accent?

00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,555

Kevin Smith
was on the show this past season

207
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,076
and, uh, he was supposed

208
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,875
to be coming to the
run-through, the rehearsal for that week,

209
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:47,513
and that morning my assistant said

210
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,157
you know, "Kevin wants to know if it's
okay if he could bring his friend, "

211
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,679
and Isaid, "Who is his friend?"

212
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:56,677
and she says,
"I don't know. Some guy named Jay. "

213
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:59,552
And I ran down the hall

214
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,672
saying, "Oh, my God!
Silent Bob is bringing Jay today!"

215
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:06,234
So, you either
knew what that meant

216
00:11:06,439 --> 00:11:08,748
and you lost your mind
or you didn't care,

217
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,076
-but I know you were very excited...
-I lost my mind.

218
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:16,067
I remember
when, uh, Billy Bob was on

219
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,475
and we were all, you know,
we were in the scene with him

220
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,672
the ﬁrst day of rehearsal
and we're, like, nervously doing the scene

221
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:23,710
and he's also nervously doing the scene

222
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:25,432
and then he stops
in the middle of the scene

223
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:28,472
and he looks at us
and he says, "I can't believe I'm here. "

224
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,477
Because his mother loves the show so much

225
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,989
and got him hooked on the show
that he was watching it.

226
00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:36,032
And he was doing a scene
with me and Simon and it's like...

227
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,153
And he couldn't believe that it was real
and we couldn't believe that he was real.

228
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,839
(ALL LAUGHING)

229
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,237
That was, that was fun.
That was a fun moment for us. Um...

230
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:48,670
PRADY: Billy Bob Thornton was one of the
nicest people that we ever met

231
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:50,756
and he came and he worked very hard.

232
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,950
And then after the show
when we tape on Tuesday nights

233
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,357
there's pizza and beer backstage
and people sort of hang out,

234
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,549
and if people have brought friends,

235
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,112
then they meet people and stuff like that.

236
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,788
And Billy Bob stayed until...

237
00:12:01,999 --> 00:12:03,273
He kind of closed the place.

238
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,391
They're, sor'ta, you know,
turning the lights on

239
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,396
and playing Closing Time...

240
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,352
FERRARI: We also had Nathan Fillion on.

241
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,754

242
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,430
He 's dreamy.

243
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,510
I had met Nathan Fillion
previously at a Golden Globes par'ty

244
00:12:17,719 --> 00:12:21,348
and it was, like, pretty deep into the
party and I was feeling super brave.

"and buy it and make

250
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,471
And he was really nice,
but then he came on the show

251
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,749
and so I kind of walked up and I was like,

252
00:12:43,959 --> 00:12:46,996

they don't remember.

Um, so we did the episode where, um,

260
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,874
we had to shoot an alternate—

end up at Skywalker Ranch

265
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,998

we had to shoot a different ending.

Um...

276
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,195
The ﬁrst ending that got shot,

277
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,753
um, we found out at the end

278
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:53,190
that Sheldon had stolen a Iightsaber

279
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,788
-from Skywalker Ranch.
-From Skywalker Ranch.

280
00:13:55,999 --> 00:13:58,035
And I just... I was deeply troubled.

281
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,073
I just... No. The character couldn't...

282
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,589
Couldn't commit what was,
essentially, a felony.

283
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:06,552
He had stolen something
that has real value.

284
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,149
So we came back a week later and...

285
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,078
I don't even remember
what the other ending was,

286
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,670
but, but no,
Sheldon was never going to become a felon.

287
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:18,428
(LAUGHING)
As long as I'm engaged in this show,

288
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,553
I just... That character can't
possibly commit a crime like that.

289
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,910
So that was, I think,
how the second ending came about.

290
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,997
What was
the second ending, now? Do you remember?

was still burned off from being tased

the print of, uh, Indiana Jones

296
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,390

ran down the street, is that not a crime?

You know, whenever
Sheldon and Amy

314
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,794
have intimacy, it's usually very speciﬁc

315
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,830

316
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:31,757
It's very, um,

317
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:34,427
it's very gently placed and, you know,

318
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,598
that scene that was
in the reel of us opening a scene kissing,

319
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,712
even Jim and I felt so strange about that

320
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,878
because our kisses have never been, you
know, kind of, like, makeout-y,

321
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:47,309
you know, and even that, um, we both know

322
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,352
how to kiss differently
than our characters do,

323
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,274
but, you know,
I remember Mark Cendrowski, our director,

324
00:15:53,479 --> 00:15:56,039
you know, he... We tried it
a lot of different ways, you know.

327
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,279
No, at one point,
I had my hand on his shoulder,

328
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,755
and then Mark wanted, like,
a little bit of movement,

329
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,871
but not, you know, very elegant movement.

330
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,834
So I think for me and Jim,
kind of everything we do that's intimate,

331
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,679
you know, including that,
it's very crafted.

cavalier about that.

00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,869
It's really fun
being an actor on this show too,

340
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:36,148
watching the other actors in scenes

341
00:16:36,439 --> 00:16:38,828
because we're also
such big fans of each other.

342
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,998
And on a personal note,
watching... You know, Mayim and Jim

343
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:45,191
are also wonderful, wonderful,
close friends off stage,

344
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:47,549
but watching their scenes
together is electric.

345
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,670
So even in rehearsals,
we'll just sit and watch their scenes

346
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:52,188
and it's really, truly...
We become fans, you know,

347
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,753
to watch the scenes
between them. It's really fun.

348
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,915
-Thank you.
-PRADY: But, Mayim, you and Jim

349
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,712
have a very particular...
I'm not making a joke,

350
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,310
you have a very particular
process that is interesting to watch.

351
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,556
Could you talk about how you and Jim,

352
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:05,353
sort of, work through and
decide how to play a scene?

353
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:07,993
Um, yeah, Imean, what's interesting is,

354
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,191
you know, Jim is
a classically trained actor

355
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,594
and I'm an untrained actor,

356
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:13,437
but what's kind of neat is that

357
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,995
we have a very similar way
that we go about

358
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,839
approaching scenes
and approaching our work

359
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,109
and we work well together
which, I think, you know,

360
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:23,150
is very important,
especially for, you know,

361
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,032
as Steve indicated,
things that are heavy and delicate,

362
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,639
especially for a character like Sheldon's

363
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,399
and then, you know, Amy
as his kind of counterpart.

364
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,672
Jim and I are very, very careful

365
00:17:32,879 --> 00:17:35,074
about how we do things,
we talk a lot about it.

366
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:36,917
You know, some actors don't talk a lot

367
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,396
and that's ﬁne and that's their
process, but Jim and I do talk a lot.

368
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,478
Um, we wonder sometimes
why the writers make decisions,

369
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,274
we have conversations of, "Gosh, did
you think we were ready for this?

370
00:17:47,479 --> 00:17:48,594
"I didn't expect this. "

371
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,233
And even with, "I love you"
Jim and I were both very,

372
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,193
we were very surprised
that we were there, you know.

373
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,356
Even the ring,
we have those conversations,

374
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,470
and, to me, I think
that adds to the complexity

375
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:00,192
of the interactions as characters

376
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,198
because when
[have to tell him [need time off,

377
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,675
you know, that had
all of those conversations

378
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,472
that Jim and I had had behind it.

379
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,272
"Is this right, is it not right?"

380
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,152
Um, so I think it's really,

381
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:15,034
it's part of what makes our
communication as actors well is that

382
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,152
as people we're interested
in the same things about those characters.

383
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,757
We talked about them
as being brilliant minds

384
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:31,109
without the paranoid schizophrenia.

385
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,632
One of the things
that I remember very much,

386
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:37,717
being around people like this
and being a person like this,

387
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,831
is the celebration of difference.

388
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,078
And the acknowledgment
of difference and the celebration of it.

389
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:47,918
And, um, we talked about that,

390
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:50,838
that these characters
celebrate who they are.

391
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:55,317
You know, I get asked this kind of thing,
a lot and I feel like,

392
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,670
um, much as there is this sort of notion

393
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,359
of, like, geek chic and, you know,

394
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:01,948
that, maybe, our show
has had some part in showing that.

395
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:03,512
I think what our show demonstrates

396
00:19:03,719 --> 00:19:07,632
is that all kinds of people can have full
lives and relationships and friends

397
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:09,477
and we don't need to
pathologize everyone,

398
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:10,668
that's not what we do,

399
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,598
but I think what our show
also shows is that

400
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,630
it still can be lonely to be different

401
00:19:14,839 --> 00:19:16,352
and some of my most favorite moments

402
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,313
are when [see the writers
have Sheldon have that experience.

403
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,669
So, you know, when people ask me, like,

404
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,757
"Oh, you guys make, you know, nerds cool. "

405
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:26,837
It's still really hard to be different
and especially for young people,

406
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,428
if you have interests
that are not aligned with popular culture,

407
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,629
it's still lonely

408
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:32,557
and I love when Sheldon expresses that,

409
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:36,354
that he does not understand
some interactions and it's painful to him.

410
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,676
And I think that's kind of, you know,
the beauty of what our writers do.

411
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,871
They show all sides of that.

it's not even a question, I just think

it'd be fun to bring up
that we did something very cool with UCLA.

Chuck, if you
wanna talk about that for a few minutes?

That would be nice.

441
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,750
Oh, yeah. We started this scholarship,

442
00:21:21,199 --> 00:21:24,396
for kids going into STEM
educational paths

443
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:28,192
-at UCLA.
-You wanna explain what STEM is?

444
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,198
STEM is science, technology,
engineering and math

445
00:21:31,439 --> 00:21:34,715
and this started a couple
of years ago, actually,

446
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,398
when we noticed that

447
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,870
there was a trend in
United States and in England

448
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:44,435
where kids were pursuing
the hard sciences

449
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,596
and one of the reasons
they were doing that

450
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,677
was they were watching the show.

451
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:51,639
And that was stunning.

452
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,469
When this started
at my kitchen table 10 years ago,

453
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,557
we never imagined
that people might make life choices

454
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:00,431
based on what we were doing.

455
00:22:00,879 --> 00:22:03,837
And, uh, so it seemed
like a natural progression

456
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:05,916
to "Let's... Maybe we can help. "

457
00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:12,236

$4 million in a fund and...

(CLEARS THROAT) I think that
Amy had really longed for all this.

466
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,638
She didn't have friends. She didn't have
a Penny, she didn't have Bernadette.

467
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:53,709
And after a lifetime of loneliness
and craving that, she had access

468
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:56,753
to somebody who could put her
on the fast-track

469
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:59,473
and with that came
these desires for a boyfriend

came along with it.

they have grown, as have
Sheldon and Amy and their relationship.

473
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,392
-So...
-Yeah, I think, Sheldon really needed...

474
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:16,228
He really needed a reason and a, you
know, a speciﬁc person or event

475
00:23:16,439 --> 00:23:21,069
that might lead to some, you know,
catalytic reaction in his existence.

with something more than herself.

the reference to Sam was cut and we made
sure when we referenced it again

505
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,228
in some kind of strange,
supernatural, superpower way.

506
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:14,511
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

507
00:25:14,719 --> 00:25:17,517
MAN: You see why we wouldn't have said,
like, "Soft Tur'tle" for example, right?

508
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,551
PRADY: Is there an animal
you think would have been better?

509
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:21,511
MAN: Soft Porcupine was tossed around.

510
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,278
Soft Porcupine wouldn't have worked.

511
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,993
(ALL LAUGHING)

512
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,111
Do you guys wanna sing Soft Kitty?

513
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,912
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

514
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:31,587
I don't know the words,
so please, take it away.

515
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:32,914
(ALL LAUGHING)

516
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:36,555
(ALL SINGING) Soft kitty, warm kitty

517
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:39,910
Little ball of fur

518
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:43,429
Happy kitty, sleepy kitty

519
00:25:43,639 --> 00:25:45,391
Purr, purr, purr

520
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,108
We love you guys so much!

521
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,038

522
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,639
