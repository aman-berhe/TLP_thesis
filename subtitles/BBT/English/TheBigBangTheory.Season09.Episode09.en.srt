00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,636
Have you guys seen
this feature that lets you talk to Siri

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,318
without pressing any buttons?

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,874
No, how does it work?

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,998
You just say,
"Hey, Siri, what time is it?"

5
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:14,554
SIRI: The time is 6:37 p.m.

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,631
So now anyone can control your phone?

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,559
Hey, Siri, show me pictures
of naked grandma butts!

8
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:25,194
-Nice try, it only recognizes my voice.
-Oh, cool.

9
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:28,232
(MIMICS RAJ) Hey, Siri, show me
pictures of naked grandma butts!

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,435
(SCOFFS) I don't sound like that.

11
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:34,147
SIRI: Here are some images
of naked grandma butts.

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,477
Hey! Good news, everybody.

13
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:40,512
Now that I'm no longer with Amy,
I have an extra ticket

14
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,392
to the annual Thanksgiving lunch buffet
at the aquarium cafeteria.

15
00:00:43,599 --> 00:00:44,588
Who wants it?

16
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,512
You realize you won't be going alone.
I'll be there the whole time.

17
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,155
Providing fish and pilgrim facts.

18
00:00:56,519 --> 00:00:57,872
Can you people hear me?

19
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,518
Well, we're having everyone over.

20
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,712
-Yeah, Leonard and l are cooking all day.
-Otherwise, we'd love to.

21
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,036
-But we can't. Mmm-hmm.
-Poor us.

22
00:01:09,399 --> 00:01:13,028
And Raj and l are volunteering at the soup
kitchen feeding food to the homeless.

23
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,151
Oh, Howard, what about you?

24
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,075
Oh, I can't, I'm going
to the soup kitchen, too.

25
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,396
You said that sounded
like the worst thing ever.

26
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,078
If you can't support me when I'm lying,
why are we married?

27
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,755
(THEME SONG PLAYING)

28
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,678
Hi, Sheldon, what's up?

29
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:00,712
Well, I'm calling because
Thanksgiving is coming up

30
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,798
and I wanted to offer you
the aquarium tickets.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,274
No one can go with you?

32
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,028
No, they'd rather spend the holiday
with each other

33
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:11,152
than find out if this
is the year I finally touch a starfish.

34
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:14,669
Anyway, I wouldn't want the tickets
to go to waste,

35
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,632
so take whomever you'd like.

36
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,193
Oh?

37
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:20,191
Okay, thank you.

38
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,870
And feel free to tell your guest
that the Myanmar catfish

39
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,751
is also known as the pilgrim fish.

40
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,191
In case the turkey's dry
and you need something juicy.

41
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:33,033
Sheldon, I can tell you want to go,

42
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,119
so if you'd be comfortable with it,
maybe we could go as friends.

43
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,911
You don't think that will be awkward?

44
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,232
Well, it is Thanksgiving
in an aquarium cafeteria,

45
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,272
so I'm gonna go out
on a limb here and say yes.

46
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,228
But if you mean between us,
I think it'll be ﬁne.

47
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:54,392
Very well, then.
I'll see you on Thanksgiving morning.

48
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:55,674
See you then.

49
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,673
Oh, forget what I said
about the Myanmar catfish.

50
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,917
My list of marine-themed
pilgrim facts is pretty short.

51
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,117
Did you know they served shellﬁsh
and eel at the ﬁrst Thanksgiving?

52
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,638
And there goes my list.

53
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,471
So, how does this work?

54
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,268
The soup kitchen manager assigns
the jobs and the shifts are six hours.

55
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:17,554
-(BUZZ|NG)
-Six hours?

56
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,633
(SIGHS) I don't wanna
complain for that long.

57
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,077
Do you ever do anything for anyone else?

58
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,631
I happen to be a giving
and generous lover.

59
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:32,595
Are you and | close
enough for me to say that's creepy?

60
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,513
We are and I believe the word you're
looking for is... (GROANS |N DISGUST)

61
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,633
-Uh, can I help you?
-Hi, we'd like to volunteer.

62
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:43,513
Oh, I appreciate you guys coming down,
but we already have enough people.

63
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,392
Any other day, please, come back.
(CHUCKLES)

64
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,909
Oh, okay.

65
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:54,270
Wipe that smug smile off your face.

66
00:03:54,559 --> 00:03:58,837
Maybe I'm happy that so many people
turned up to help the less fortunate.

67
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,678
(CHUCKLES)

68
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,359
Are you and | close enough for me to say--

69
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:04,151
That he's an ass? He beat you to it.

70
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,436
Uh, l was wrong.
A large group had to cancel.

71
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:09,630
Oh, great, we'd love to help!

72
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:13,668
Wipe that smug smile off your face.

73
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,671
(CHUCKLES) I can't!

74
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,233
Look at us! Our first Thanksgiving
as husband and wife.

75
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,796
-I know, lfeel so grown up.
-Uh, sweetie, you are grown up.

76
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:29,708
Really? How many grown-ups do you know
who have Mr. Spock oven mitts?

77
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,908
Hey, the recipes are on my iPad.
Will you pull 'em up?

78
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,076
-Yep. What's the code?
-My birthday.

79
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,754
It's not working.

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,877
It's just four digits.
The month and day.

81
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:44,074
Nope.

82
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:45,829
Let me see.

83
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,709
Yeah. There.

84
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,838
What number were you putting in?

85
00:04:58,519 --> 00:04:59,838
Uh...

86
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,518
-You don't know my birthday, do you?
-Yes, I do.

87
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,756
-When is it?
-May.

88
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,559
May what?

89
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:14,070
I'm not gonna say your password out loud,
that is not secure.

90
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:17,593
You don't know
your own husband's birthday!

91
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,951
-You don't know everything about me.
-Your birthday is December second.

92
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,269
You grew up on Perkin Street.

93
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,313
The last four digits of your social
are seven-six-two-one.

94
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:28,556
And the odds of me letting
you forget this are zero! (CHUCKLES)

95
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,676
Oh, look at us, our last Thanksgiving
as husband and wife.

96
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:38,992
-Hello.
-Hi.

97
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:42,673
-Ready for the aquarium?
-I am.

98
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,073
And in an effort to reduce awkwardness
as we learn how to function as friends,

99
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:50,709
I printed out a list of safe topics
for polite conversation.

100
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,515
If that makes you more comfortable.

101
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,674
If there were a list of things
that make me more comfortable,

102
00:05:57,879 --> 00:05:59,790
lists would be on the top of that list.

103
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:05,352
Okay, now, oh, since last we spoke,
have you acquired any pets?

104
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:07,198
No. You?

105
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,835
No.

106
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,357
Um, since last we spoke,
have you planned or gone on any vacations?

107
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,511
I might go visit my aunt next week.

108
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:20,797
-Your aunt in Modesto?
-No. The one in Bakersfield.

109
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,671
Bakersfield, | see.

110
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,436
Where has this list been all my life?

111
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:30,195
We're gonna have you washing dishes.

112
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,115
Uh, aprons and rubber gloves are here.
Just scrape, wash and stack.

113
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:35,474
If you need me, I'll be around.

114
00:06:36,559 --> 00:06:38,993
So we don't even get to be
up front where the action is?

115
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,599
What difference does it make?

116
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,952
I don't know. I was hoping some poor kid
would come up to me and say,

117
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:46,036
(IN BRITISH ACCENT)
"Please, sir. lwant some more."

118
00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:52,915
You're in a soup kitchen,
not a production of Oliver!

119
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,595
(IN NORMAL ACCENT)
It's not like I'm expecting them to sing.

120
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,994
Then the next day was 73 degrees,
then the day after that was 72,

121
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,593
and then it was 72 again,

122
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,077
then it was 74,
and that brings us to today, at...

123
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:11,793
l'd wear shorts if I had a pair, 78.

124
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:15,391
Are we done discussing the weather?

125
00:07:16,359 --> 00:07:18,031
I don't know if I'd call it "discussing,"

126
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:20,036
you kind of sat back
and let me do all the work.

127
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:23,197
Let's see what's next on the list. Oh!

128
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,638
Uh, do you whittle,
and if so what kind of knife do you--

129
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:30,718
Sheldon!
We've known each other a long time.

130
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:33,717
We are perfectly capable
of having a conversation

131
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,114
without relying
on a list off the Internet.

132
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,149
All right, what should we talk about?

133
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,075
I don't know, just ask me
whatever comes to mind.

134
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,079
Very well.
I know you've been seeing other men.

135
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,910
Have you had coitus with any of them?

136
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,031
Man, I walked right into that one.

137
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,589
Next, we need a teaspoon of pepper,

138
00:08:02,119 --> 00:08:05,589
which I believe was also the name
of your childhood dog.

139
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,276
Fine, you think you know so much?

140
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,518
-Who's my favorite Spice Girl?
-Baby.

141
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,079
-Who's my favorite member of NSYNC?
-Justin.

142
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,396
-Who's my favorite Backstreet Boy?
-(SCOFFS) Nice try, NSYNC forever.

143
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:17,554
Damn it!

144
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,230
(CHUCKLES) Face it, you can't stump me.
lam the king of husbands.

145
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:24,907
I know you don't like that lingerie
that I got you on Valentine's Day,

146
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:27,553
I know you hate the word "moist,"
I know you don't--

147
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,228
Hang on, wait, wait.
Why don't I like the lingerie you got me?

148
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,399
Because it's orange and you think
it makes you look like a slutty carrot.

149
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,552
Interesting. I never told you that.

150
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,479
-Sure, you did.
-No, I never told anyone that.

151
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,912
But I did write it in myjournal.

152
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,194
(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) What?

153
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,996
I didn't know you had ajournal.

154
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,438
I also know your voice
gets higher when you're lying.

155
00:08:57,719 --> 00:08:58,947
(IN LOW-PITCHED VOICE) No, it doesn't.

156
00:09:06,439 --> 00:09:10,068
-Huh, this reminds me of high school.
-You worked in a restaurant?

157
00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:13,311
No, lwas in India.
It was humid and smelled funny.

158
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,519
All right, lthink I'm getting
into a groove here. This isn't so bad.

159
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,756
Yeah, only five hours
and 40 minutes to go.

160
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:22,916
We've only been doing this 20 minutes?

161
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:28,508
You know, I read that washing dishes
can be an excellent form of meditation.

162
00:09:28,719 --> 00:09:34,157
The key is that while washing the dishes,
one should only be "washing the dishes."

163
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:39,757
Just because you have that accent
doesn't mean what you say isn't stupid.

164
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,032
No, seriously,
it's about being present in the moment.

165
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:48,755
Focusing on the feeling of the warm water.
The smell of the detergent,

166
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,031
the sound of the dishes squeaking
and following your own breath.

167
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,629
It's about simply being.

168
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,195
Huh? (CHUCKLES)

169
00:09:57,439 --> 00:09:59,111
Okay, I'll try it.

170
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:02,111
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

171
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,631
-I need three people out front.
-|'|| do it!

172
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,989
RAJ: Me!
EMILY: Right here!

173
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,270
No fair, I was meditating!

174
00:10:14,199 --> 00:10:15,518
Oh, come on, don't be mad.

175
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:17,869
It was a long time ago
and it was an accident.

176
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,513
How can reading myjournal be an accident?

177
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:22,876
I didn't even know what it was. I saw it
on your nightstand, I picked it up.

178
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:24,717
Well, when you realized what it was,
why didn't you stop?

179
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,155
(SCOFFS) You know me,
I'm a big ol' bookworm.

180
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:31,069
-Let's just finish cooking.
-(STUTTER|NG)

181
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,998
Let me make this up to you.

182
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:36,987
Sometimes, I keep an onlinejournal.
I want you to read something that I wrote.

183
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,189
Really, I'm fine.

184
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:41,988
Uh, okay, then I'll just read it to you.
It's from the day that we first met.

185
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:44,067
(CLEARS THROAT)

186
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,071
-"Beauty, thy name is Penny--"
-Oh, God, stop.

187
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,590
I don't want you to read
something you think'll just butter me up.

188
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,511
I wanna hear
the most recent thing you wrote.

189
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,189
Fine.

190
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,033
(HUMMING AWKWARDLY)

191
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,072
"Penny's beauty, like our love,
grows more with each passing day."

192
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,395
Does it really say that?

193
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,993
Why would I lie?

194
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:18,149
"OMG, OMG, We're so close to
the new Star Wars. I can't take it. Gah."

195
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:20,993
"Gah"?

196
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,310
Well you didn't read it right.
The new Star Wars is coming, gah!

197
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,196
l'm sensing things have gotten awkward.

198
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:36,558
No, it's okay.

199
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:39,718
If we're friends,
we should be able to talk about anything.

200
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:41,187
All right.

201
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,429
So, you had some questions
about me seeing other people.

202
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,191
-Just a few.
-Go ahead.

203
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,317
How many dates have you been on?
Who were they with?

204
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,279
Where did you go? Where did you meet them?
Did you sleep with them?

205
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,591
And how much longer to the aquarium?
I'm getting kind of hungry.

206
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,798
Let's see... (SIGHS)

207
00:12:02,319 --> 00:12:05,436
I've been on six dates
with three different people.

208
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:08,030
It was either for coffee or dinner.

209
00:12:08,479 --> 00:12:11,551
One I met at a bookstore
and two I met online.

210
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,232
I haven't slept with anyone,
the aquarium is 40 minutes away,

211
00:12:15,439 --> 00:12:17,953
and there's a baggie of Cheerios for you
in the glove compartment.

212
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:20,990
Is that regular or Honey Nut?

213
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:23,033
I mixed them.

214
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:27,319
You mixed them. No wonder gentleman
callers are pounding down your door.

215
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,712
Do you have any questions for me?

216
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,269
Just one.

217
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,114
Are you doing okay?

218
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,315
I am.

219
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,669
Good.

220
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,596
(STUTTERS) I want you to be happy.

221
00:12:47,719 --> 00:12:48,674
I believe you.

222
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:55,193
l'd believe you more if you threw
a few Apple Jacks in here.

223
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,793
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

224
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:03,394
You gotta be kidding me.

225
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:04,868
Sorry?

226
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,517
-(SHUDDER|NG) You're Elon Musk.
-I am.

227
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,076
(STUTTERING) What are you doing here?

228
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,119
l'm washing dishes.

229
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,312
Well, l was on the turkey line,
but I got demoted

230
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,237
for being too generous with the gravy.

231
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,031
Oh, man... (CHUCKLING)
What an honor to meet you.

232
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:35,278
(GASPS) I'm such a fan of Tesla
and SpaceX. All your companies.

233
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,431
-Howard Wolowitz, Caltech.
-Nice to meet you, Howard.

234
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,834
Feels great to come down here
and help the less fortunate, huh?

235
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,309
Oh, yeah.

236
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,832
Nothing better than helping people.

237
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,510
Which is something I realized
when lwas viewing Earth

238
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:56,473
from the deck
of the International Space Station

239
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,873
where I spent two months
as a payload specialist,

240
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,914
ajob l was qualified for
because I'm an MIT-trained engineer.

241
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,036
And I thought I ladled the gravy on thick.

242
00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:12,593
Sorry. lt'sjust... You're you...
(CHUCKLES)

243
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,151
And I really want you to adopt me.

244
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:19,117
Well, you're here on Thanksgiving,
so you're probably a good person.

245
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,271
Oh, I made my wife come down, too.

246
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,316
You think you might ever
get back out to space?

247
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,077
Is that ajob offer?
'Cause I really wanna go to Mars.

248
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,632
Assuming I can bring my wife.

249
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,434
She hardly takes up any room.
She's basically a carry-on.

250
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,427
Well, we're not quite there yet,
but we're always looking for engineers.

251
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,318
So let me give you my email,
we can stay in touch.

252
00:14:39,719 --> 00:14:40,708
Thank you.

253
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,188
(HOWARD GASPS)

254
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,115
Oh, look.

255
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,630
Someone hardly touched their pumpkin pie.
Want to share it with me?

256
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,870
A partially eaten piece of pumpkin pie
from a homeless shelter?

257
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,633
With Elon Musk? You bet I do!

258
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,156
You know, for a Thanksgiving buffet in an
aquarium cafeteria, that was really bad.

259
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,436
You're just upset
'cause they ran out of pilgrim hats.

260
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,434
They gave one to that baby,
he wasn't even awake.

261
00:15:14,719 --> 00:15:17,791
Well, it wouldn't be a holiday
without you being mad at a baby.

262
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,232
Oh, would you care to play
an ocean-themed game | invented?

263
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,797
-Sure, what is it?
-lt's called Food, Friend, Fight.

264
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:30,469
One of us chooses three aquatic creatures
and the other one must decide

265
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,955
which he would eat, befriend, or battle.

266
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,351
So it's like Kiss, Marry, Kill.

267
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:37,714
What is that?

268
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,717
It's a game where
you're given three people

269
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,036
and you choose
which one you'd kiss, marry, or kill.

270
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,559
Well, my game is better because instead
of marrying someone, you get to eat them.

271
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,435
Let's just play.

272
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,192
I'll start you off easy.
Electric eel, puffer fish, shrimp.

273
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,229
Hmm.

274
00:15:56,439 --> 00:15:58,350
Well, I wouldn't fight the eel

275
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,028
because I know it can generate
enough current to kill a horse.

276
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,712
So I'd eat the eel, fight the shrimp,
and befriend the puffer fish

277
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,832
because it would be nice to have
company on those days | feel bloated.

278
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,191
-Very well done.
-Thank you.

279
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:13,713
Okay, your turn.

280
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,875
Um... Seal, hagfish...

281
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:21,229
SpongeBob SquarePants.

282
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,437
Well, I'd befriend SpongeBob, but he's not
real, so I can't do that, can I?

283
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,751
But you can pal around with a hagfish?

284
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:29,711
Hey, let's not pull at that thread.

285
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:33,148
Okay, I'll fight SpongeBob.

286
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,670
Because he's so friendly,
we'll just end up tickling each other.

287
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:39,439
Um, l'll befriend the seal
because he's trainable,

288
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:41,834
which was the problem I'm having
with my current friends.

289
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:44,792
Which means I'll have to eat the hagfish.

290
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,875
Isn't that gross?

291
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,072
A hagfish can produce enough mucus
to fill a bucket in a minute.

292
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,353
I know. It makes its own gravy,
it'll slide right down.

293
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,908
I miss this.

294
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,557
How can you miss a game
you've never played before, silly?

Hey, where'd you go?
I can't tell if the turkey's done.

298
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,398

00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:26,796
-Hi, lover.
-(GASPS)

300
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,310
What are you doing?

301
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,955
I'm sorry about the journal
and I want to make it up to you,

302
00:17:34,159 --> 00:17:37,913
so I'm going to let you post
a shame photo of me on Facebook.

303
00:17:40,879 --> 00:17:44,076
lam not putting that on the Internet!
I don't want people to see this.

304
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:45,632
I don't want to see it!

305
00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:50,674
(CHUCKLES) You don't want people
to see what, huh? A little bit of this?

306
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,199
Oh...

307
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:56,873
Some of this?

308
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,315
And since it's Thanksgiving,
an extra helping of this.

309
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,189
Happy Thanks--

310
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:16,871
I'm glad you had a nice time with Amy.

311
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,552
Uh-- Me, too. It's comforting to know that
she and l are able to function as friends.

312

with any of my exes.

will be able to pull it off.

-I did.

Listen, I really enjoyed
spending this morning with you.

321

Oh, well, I can't take all the credit.

322
00:18:47,439 --> 00:18:50,829
It was pretty funny when that one
anchovy started going the wrong way.

It was. Uh, listen...

lwas thinking that, um, maybe I'm ready
to be your girlfriend again.

326
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,068
Oh?

327
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,551
I thought we were just friends.

328
00:19:08,959 --> 00:19:13,237
We are. But I was hoping, maybe--

329
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:18,031
Amy, I excel at many things,
but getting over you wasn't one of them.

330
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:23,193
I think I need to just be your friend.

331
