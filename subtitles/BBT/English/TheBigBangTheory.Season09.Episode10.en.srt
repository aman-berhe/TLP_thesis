into madness. Day two.

00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,192
It's 2:25 am.
and I feel the urge to urinate.

00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,359
My normal urination time is 7:10 am.

00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,518
But here I am, in the middle of the night,
struggling to keep my mind sharp,

5
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,598
and my pajamas dry.

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,678
It's only a matter of time
before my tenuous grasp on reality fades.

-You were just humming.
-Are you sure?

11
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,629
Sometimes, when my brain
really gets moving, it makes noise.

12
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,037
How does your brain feel about calculating
the surface tension of the domain walls?

No.

Well, they were no help at all.

34

Which is crazy since rock and roll
is all about good customer service.

35

Yeah, so you have a song stuck
in your head. It happens to everybody.

what this song is, but I can't.

this day would come.

of my descent into madness.

on Facebook for our band and I--

69

Wait a second, how could you do that
without consulting me?

70
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:36,029
It's not a big deal.
Just took, like, five minutes to set up.

71

That's not the point.

00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,518
When we created Footprints on the Moon,

73
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,553
we agreed that every band decision
would be mutual.

74
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,069
Now you're just trying
to take over the whole thing.

You know, maybe I should go solo.

76
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,354
But someone joined our page.
We have an actual fan.

77
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,030
All right, this thing's bigger than you
and me, band's back together.

he wouldn't bring it up again.

Maybe intimate is what I need.

You've never really been with a man.

back to our fan and thank him.

00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,109
For example, Leonard has no idea
what I did to his coffee.

168
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,036
It wasn't replace it with Folgers
crystals, I'll tell you that much.

169
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:41,790
Hey, can we please get back to work?

170
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,151
This is Leonard.
He's your best friend in the world.

171
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,271
Just stop, this is ridiculous.

172
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,592
Sometimes he gets cranky,

173
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,112
but you can trust him with your life.

174
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:57,550
And he does more things for you
than I can even begin to list.

175
00:10:58,639 --> 00:10:59,913
Thank you.

176
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,318
Oh, no, he's drinking it!

177
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,230
Look at this.
Trent is rebuilding a vintage motorcycle.

178
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:13,150
That is so cool!

179
00:11:13,359 --> 00:11:16,908
Old broken things are so much better
than new things that work.

180
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,628
-Who's Trent?
-Oh, he's our fan.

181
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,989
Fan of what?

182
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,950
Uh, did you forget? We're in a band.

183
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:28,557
You mean, because you played one time
in the comic book store?

184
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:31,831
And at the children's hospital
until they asked us to leave.

185
00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:36,834
Hey, dude, Trentjust checked in
at the coffee shop on Fair Oaks.

186
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:39,155
Really? You wanna go down there
and meet him?

187
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,590
Are you stalking him? That's creepy.

188
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,475
It's not creepy. I built the Footprints
on the Moon fan page. Trentjoined it.

189
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,079
After that, all I did was
check out his profile,

190
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,474
go back in the archive of his feed
until I found his Twitter handle.

191
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,352
From there it was easy
to find him on Instagram,

192
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,312
Snapchat and pretty much track
his every movement.

193
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,636
So, if you think that's creepy,
you married the wrong guy.

194
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:59,558
Maybe I should marry Trent.

195
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,036
Yeah. Like she could get Trent.

196
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,915
(CHUCKLING)

197
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,715
-This is delicious.
-Thank you.

198
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,115
Been a long time
since I had a home-cooked meal.

199
00:12:10,319 --> 00:12:12,230
When you were married,
did your wife cook?

200
00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:13,633
Uh, not at first, no.

201
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,876
But when she started cheating on me
with the French chef,

202
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,718
she became quite the wiz in the kitchen.

203
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,199
-So, a little silver lining.
-I suppose. Yeah.

204
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,276
Nothing takes the sting
out of a shattered life

205
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,789
like a properly seasoned bowl
of onion soup.

206
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,951
-How long have you lived here?
-Uh...

207
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,953
About five years. I'm actually thinking
about moving to a better place,

208
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,230
now that I don't need to be so close to--

209
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,235
-Well, you know. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
-I do.

210
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:42,988
The brilliant physicist that I now know
lives in the area. Not that I care.

211
00:12:43,999 --> 00:12:47,958
Yeah. Anyway, he doesn't drive, so
I pretty much had to take him everywhere.

212
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,798
Had to or got to?

213
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:51,229
Sorry.

214
00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:53,031
-My fault, I brought him up.
-Yeah.

215
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,391
Well, let's change the subject.
No more mentions of you-know-who.

216
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,797
That's a cool train.
Where did you get that?

217
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:03,636
(HUMMING)

218
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,316
This song is never going to stop.

219
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:19,477
Have you ever dealt with something
so relentlessly irritating?

220
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,871
That's a trick question, right?

221
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,948
Now, I shouldn't be surprised.

222
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,835
There's a rich history of brilliant minds
descending into madness.

223
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,678
Come on, Sheldon,
there are plenty of smart people

224
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:33,198
who don't have mental problems.

225
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,039
Yeah, she's right. For every Newton
who had a psychological issue,

226
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,550
there's an Edison who was just ajerk.
That could totally be you.

227
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:43,791
Empedocles thought he was a god
and jumped into a volcano.

228
00:13:43,999 --> 00:13:46,957
You know, Pythagoras had
an irrational fear of beans.

229
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,153
Tesla fell madly in love with a pigeon
who he claimed loved him back.

230
00:13:52,439 --> 00:13:54,475
Maybe hejust had bread in his pocket.

231
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,396
The list extends outside of science.
Painters like Van Gogh and Pollock.

232
00:14:01,599 --> 00:14:05,035
Chess champion Bobby Fischer.
Brian Wilson of The Beach--

233
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:21,115
I remember the song! It's called Darlin'
by The Beach Boys! Thank goodness!

234
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:25,748
I'm not crazy! I don't have
to take a pigeon as my bride!

235
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:31,113
There goes our shot
at him living on the roof.

236
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,478
All right, there he is.

237
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,876
-So, should we introduce ourselves?
-No, let him spot us.

238
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,478
I wonder if he's listening
to our music right now.

239
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,797
Could you imagine?
What a cool way for us to meet.

240
00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:52,036
He's playing our song
and looks up and there we are.

241
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,118
His favorite two-piece
acoustic sci-fi novelty rock band.

242
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,233
And he's all, like, "Aren't you the guys
from Footprints on the Moon..."

243
00:15:00,439 --> 00:15:02,316
Ooh! What is he doing?

244
00:15:05,999 --> 00:15:09,628
-I can't watch.
-It's okay. Oh, it's okay, he's done.

245
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,191
Why is he looking at it?

246
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,313
No, he's not going to eat it, is he?

247
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,232
Come on, Trent, you're better than--

248
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:19,554
BOTH: No!

249
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,229
Let's just go.

250
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,349
Hey, aren't you the guys from--

251
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,232
-Nope!
-Never heard of them!

252
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,951
(DARLIN' PLAYING)

253
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:39,477
I wonder why it was this particular song
that was stuck in my head.

254
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,033
I don't know, it's pretty catchy.

255
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,759
Yeah, do you even like The Beach Boys?

256
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,838
They have "beach" right in the name,
what do you think?

257
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:48,353
Well, now that you can focus again,

258
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,120
what do you say we get back
to surface tension of domain walls?

259
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:55,073
Of course, I'm already seeing
a more efficient way of taming the--

260
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,077
I know why the song was in my head.

261
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,350
-Why?
-It's about Amy.

262
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,756
Okay, look. I know Amy's like an old lady,

263
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,872
but she's not old enough to have a song
from the '60s written about her.

264
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,953
It's about how she made my life better.
Consider the lyrics.

265
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,991
She did soften your life, didn't she?

266
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:25,828
Yes! She's like
the dryer sheets of my heart!

267
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,554
I have to go.

268
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,195
Aw.

269
00:16:33,439 --> 00:16:35,999
Am I like the dryer sheets of your heart?

270
00:16:37,999 --> 00:16:40,433
Better. You're the lint trap of my love.

271
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,838
-That's an interesting tie clip.
-Oh, thanks. It's Avogadro's constant.

272
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,429
It's useful for calculating the number
of atoms in a substance,

273
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,552
or causing regret in anyone
who asks about it.

274
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:04,712
No, I think it's neat. (CHUCKLES)

275
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,909
-Oh!
-Sorry, sorry!

276
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,556
No one's ever liked the tie clip before,
so ljust lost all control. I...

277
00:17:11,479 --> 00:17:14,630
No, it's okay,
and we are on a date. I'm...

278
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,589
I'm just a little nervous.

279
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,399
Well, no need to be nervous with me.

280
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,478
I'm just a harmless giant
from aforeign land.

281
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,350
You know, I'm just being silly. I...

282
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,911
I don't know what I'm waiting for.

283
00:17:33,159 --> 00:17:36,151
-(KNOCK ON THE DOOR)
-SHELDON: Amy. Amy. Amy.

284
00:17:38,159 --> 00:17:41,037
-That's Sheldon.
-You're kidding! How's my hair?

285
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,117
Sheldon, this isn't a good time.

286
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,149
I don't care. Amy, there was a song
I couldn't get out of my head.

287
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,920
Eventually, I realized
the song was about you,

288
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:00,557
and like that eanivorm,
I can't get you out of my heart.

289
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,269
So, what I'm trying to say is,

290
00:18:03,879 --> 00:18:05,198
you're my heartworm.

291
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:10,430
The metaphorical kind,
not the poodle-killing kind.

292
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,549
What?

293
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,834
If I may.

294
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:18,591
I believe what he's saying,
in a charming and delightful way,

295
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,029
is that he loves you and wants you back.

Don't mind me.

I'm sorry, I didn't realize
you were on a date.

No, it's okay, keep going.

299
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,991
Amy, if you want to be my girlfriend
again, I really want to be your boyfriend.

300
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,711
I really want that, too.

301
00:18:41,199 --> 00:18:42,348
Good.

302
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,992
Because I love you.

303
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,871
I love you, too.

you have a spare moment,
