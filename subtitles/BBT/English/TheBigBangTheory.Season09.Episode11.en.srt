00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,316
-Guys, tickets already went on sale!
-What?

2
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:00,878
They're not supposed to be available yet.

3
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,472
I don't know what to tell you,
but they're on sale!

4
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:05,029
(STAMMERS) Wait. Are you sure
they're Star Wars tickets?

5
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,790
No, it's Steel Magnolias 2: Even Steelier.

6
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,435
The website's frozen. I can't get in!

7
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,635
-LEONARD: Yeah, me, too.
-Same here.

8
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,791
-Guys, they're gonna sellout!
-What are we gonna do?

9
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:16,870
All right, this goes
against everything I stand for,

10
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:18,791
but desperate times
call for desperate measures.

11
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,995
Lord...

12
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,229
This is Sheldon Cooper.

13
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,514
You're good friends with my mom.

14
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,671
I know I've spent my life
denying that you exist.

15
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,796
-Got 'em!
-Yeah, and |wi|| continue to do so!

16

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

17
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,476
I'm really happy
you and Amy are back together.

18
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,635
Thank you.

19
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,836
I'm also really happy,
but I can't pretend it's for you.

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,433
New Star Wars in three days! (CHUCKLES)

21
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,076
Hey, Thursday can't get here soon enough.

22
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,673
I'm taking off work
to watch the original trilogy

23
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,195
while I eat enough Star Wars
cereal to choke a Wookiee.

24
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:19,799
Uh, sweetie, you do realize
Thursday is Amy's birthday.

25
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,315
Yeah, and you do realize
I bought my ticket

26
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,754
when Amy and I were broken up?

27
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,078
I hope you didn't
need anything in that case,

28
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,275
'cause it's closed.

29
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,315
You guys just got back together.

30
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,198
You might not want
to ditch her on her birthday.

31
00:02:33,359 --> 00:02:35,350
I think Penny has a point.
You can see it another day.

32
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,238
But someone might spoil the movie.

33
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,391
No, no one can spoil
Amy's birthday for me.

34
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:41,515
Surprise! She's even older.
Who saw that coming?

35
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,511
Aw! That's nice. Put that on her cake.

36
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:57,708
Oh, great. This again.

37
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,508
Arthur? What brings you back?

38
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,910
Beats me. ljust

39
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:07,115
hope this isn't a sex dream.

40
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,715
In the past, you've come to me
when I'm struggling with a dilemma.

41
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,396
And... And the one time where...
Where you were afraid,

42
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,915
and you needed me for...
For a night light.

43
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,988
What's... What's troubling you?

44
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,872
Well...

45
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,439
My friends are telling me

46
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,319
I shouldn't abandon my girlfriend
on her birthday

47
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,516
to see the new Star Wars movie.

48
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,233
Well, sounds right.

49
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,596
Can... Can I get out of this mumu now?

50
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:43,111
Those are the robes of the Jedi,

51
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:46,077
the guardians of peace
and justice in the galaxy.

52
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,119
And they... They...
They don't wear undenrvear.

53
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,112
So, you agree with my friends
that I should skip the premiere?

54
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,915
Do... Do you love this girl?

55
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,229
Yes.

56
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,597
But she knows
how important Star Wars is to me.

57
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,070
Well, maybe you should show her how...

58
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,548
How important she is to you.

59
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,156
By seeing the movie she'd want me to see?

60
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,199
Sheldon, you can see this movie
whenever you want.

61
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,511
But you only have a limited number of days

62
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,989
that you can be with this woman.

63
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:29,074
Be with her.

64
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,794
You're right.

65
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,315
Great.

66
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:37,073
Where are you going?

67
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:39,550
I don't know,

68
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,631
but, hopefully,
somewhere I can wear pants.

69
00:04:44,679 --> 00:04:45,998
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

70
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:52,547
Sheldon, what's wrong?

71
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,838
I wanted to let you know
I'll be spending your birthday with you.

72
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,069
Okay.

73
00:04:59,359 --> 00:05:02,032
See, I had tickets
to the Star Wars premiere that night,

74
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,236
but Professor Proton
came to me in a dream,

75
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:07,232
dressed as Obi-Wan Kenobi,
and convinced me I should be with you.

76
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,395
Obi-what?

77
00:05:10,679 --> 00:05:12,635
I'll let you get back to sleep now.
Good night.

78
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,553
Okay. Good night. Wait... Sheldon,

79
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,188
were you actually not gonna
spend my birthday with me?

80
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,034
(YAWNING) |t's late. Got to go. Bye.

81
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:25,467
Good for Sheldon deciding

82
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:27,391
-to stay with Amy on her birthday.
-I know.

83
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,232
It's still gonna be weird
to see the movie without him.

84
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,917
Well, we could wait a couple of days
and see it together.

85
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,155
(ALL LAUGHING)

86
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,074
Hello.

87
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:39,991
Hey. We're going to the comic book store.
You want to come?

88
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,149
No, I can't.

89
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:43,389
I need to make preparations
for Amy's birthday.

90
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:46,313
Which leads me
to the following bit of business.

91
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,947
This is my ticket to Star Wars.

92
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,109
I don't have to tell you

93
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,636
it is worth far more
than its face value of $15.50.

94
00:05:55,119 --> 00:05:57,189
I trust you'll give it to someone worthy.

95
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,154
You got it.

96
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:00,593
Well, Penny might want to join us--

97
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:02,954

Well, find out.

101

if I want to watch Mean Girls,

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,833
We're sorry. What do you need?

110
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,955
Well, as you know,

111
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:39,075
I'll be celebrating
Amy's birthday with her,

112
00:06:39,239 --> 00:06:42,072
and I could use your assistance
in helping me select the perfect gift.

113
00:06:42,239 --> 00:06:43,388
-Sure.
-Well, so far,

114
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:44,514
I've come up with three ideas.

115
00:06:44,679 --> 00:06:46,032
The first is a chance for her

116
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,191
to play the harp
with the LA Philharmonic.

117
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,873
Wow. You can really arrange that?

118
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,473
Well, I said a chance, you know.

119
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:54,107
When you tell them it's your birthday
at Bennigan's, they make a fuss.

120
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:55,917
I don't see why the Philharmonic
would be any different.

121
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,351
How about
something a little more realistic?

122
00:06:59,559 --> 00:07:01,868
WeII, Amy enjoys
knitting her own sweaters.

123
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,600
So, I was thinking
of getting her an aII-expense-paid trip

124
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,796
to the Wisconsin Sheep & Wool Festival.

125
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,872
Sorry. I was waiting for the "bazinga."

126
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:15,351
Hold on. It could be romantic.

127
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,588
The two of them away together,

128
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,637
keeping each other warm
in snowy Wisconsin.

129
00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:20,391
No, no, no, no. She'd be going anne.

130
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:22,868
But if you think I'm afraid of birds,
you should see me around sheep.

131
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,478
Okay, weII, what's the third option?

132
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:26,913
That I have coitus with her.

133
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,195
(GLASS SHATTERS)

134
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,755
What do you think about
giving Sheldon's ticket to Stuart?

135
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:39,428
I don't know.

136
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,477
Have you ever
seen a movie with Stuart before?

137
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,231
It's like going with your grandpa.

138
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,508
Instead of eating popcorn,

139
00:07:45,679 --> 00:07:47,749
he brings little pieces
of chicken in Tupperware

140
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:48,988
and a thermos full of soup.

141
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:51,828
He's not that bad.

142
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:54,752
Hey, Stuart, got any plans Thursday night?

143
00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:57,308
My... My doctor's worried
about my circulation,

144
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,391
so I was thinking about
walking around the mall.

145
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,389
Why?

146
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,628
-We||--
-Hey, you guys.

147
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,153
Make sure to wear sensible shoes.

148
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,912
WiI, want to go to Star Wars, Thursday?

149
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,828
Absolutely.

150
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,115
Fine. Take WiI.

151
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,918
See if he brings you cIam chowder.

152
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,118
Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay...

153
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,271
Let's... Let's...
Let's just recap our options.

154
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:20,953
All right, we've got
harp thing, sheep thing...

155
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,149
Wild thing.

156
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:27,158
Which do you think she'd prefer?

157
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:30,713
Because I checked
the Sheep and Wool Festival website,

158
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,393
and there's only 8,000 tickets left.

159
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,950
Okay. Sheldon, being physical with Amy
is a huge step for you.

160
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,439
Yeah, are you ready for this?

161
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:42,911
Intimacy in any form
has been challenging for me,

162
00:08:43,079 --> 00:08:45,229
but I'd like to show her
how important she is,

163
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,675
and it feels like
now might be the right time.

164
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,512
Sheldon, that's so beautiful.

165
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:51,108
Then it's settled.

166
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,270
Amy's birthday present
will be my genitals.

167
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:01,908
Thanks for taking me out.

168
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:03,558
Well, you're spending
your birthday with Sheldon.

169
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,914
Why not celebrate early?

170
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:06,034
So, where do you want to go?

171
00:09:06,199 --> 00:09:08,667
I heard that new Mexican place
on Greene Street is good.

172
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,192
Sure, sure.

173
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,555
Or we could take you to get a bikini wax.

174
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,114
Why would I get a bikini wax
for my birthday?

175
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,629
(STAMMERS) I don't know.
It was just a thought.

176
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,233
I think I'll just stick to Mexican.

177
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,154
Great.

178
00:09:24,319 --> 00:09:26,879
And then, maybe after,
we can watch a dirty movie,

179
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,315
and if anybody has any questions
about what happened or how,

180
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,549
we can answer them.

181
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:34,716
Okay, what is going on?

182
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,269
We just want you to be prepared

183
00:09:36,439 --> 00:09:38,953
for any surprises
that might happen tomorrow.

184
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,758
What surprises?

185
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,995
(EXHALES)

186
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:46,232
We don't want to spoil anything,

187
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,471
but you should know that
Sheldon said he's ready to be physical.

188
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,039
You shut your damn mouth!

189
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,991
You actually heard him say this?

190
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,799
Yes. He said he wants to do something
to show you how much you mean to him.

191
00:10:00,999 --> 00:10:02,034
(EXHALES)

192
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,879
I... I can't believe it. I...

193
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,591
I don't know what to say.

194
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:12,037
Well, we're really happy for you,
and we know how much he cares--

195
00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:13,598
I do know what to say! Let's get me waxed!

196
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,834
Why isn't it ever
Angie Dickinson's bedroom?

197
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,715
You're back.

198
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,388
It... It doesn't seem like it's up to me.

199
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:36,588
I suppose you're here

200
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:39,398
because I've decided
to be physical with my girlfriend,

201
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,710
and I've never done that before.

202
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,554
Excuse me for a moment.

203
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,033
(LIGHTSABER ACTIVATING)

204
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,028
Well, it was worth a shot.

205
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,995
So, can you help me?

206
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,392
Uh, all right, um...

207
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,154
Once... Once the man gets

208
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:16,674
the woman out of her...
Out of her bloomers...

209
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,710
No. Not that.

210
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,949
I... I understand the mechanics.

211
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,634
Oh, good. Good. 'Cause

212
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,270
I have no idea what kids these days

213
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:30,270
are calling their... Their parts.

214
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:35,117
I think they say "junk."

215
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,672
What is happening to this world?

216
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,552
What... What do you
actually need to know?

217
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,438
This is an important night for us,

218
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,149
and I'm worried I might be overwhelmed
and ruin everything.

219
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,277
(SIGHS) Sheldon,
if you're with the right person,

220
00:11:58,439 --> 00:12:00,350
it'll be okay.

221
00:12:01,999 --> 00:12:03,034
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

222
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,071
Thank you, Arthur.

223
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:08,038
You are the wisest of the wise.

224
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,751
Well, that's...
That's very nice of you to say,

225
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,480
but I think I'm just an expression of...

226
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:15,834
Of your unconscious mind.

227
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:18,509
Oh, sure.

228
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,955
Well, you're fun to look at.

229
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,075
Tonight's the night!

230
00:12:27,239 --> 00:12:28,831
Yeah, the wait is finally over!

231
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,070
I know.
Then you'll finaIIy stop talking about it!

232
00:12:32,599 --> 00:12:33,827
-Ready to go?
-Let's do this.

233
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,712
-Have fun, guys!
-We will.

234
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:37,915
-I can't believe Sheldon gave this up.
-I know.

235
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,637
We're gonna have
so much more fun than him.

236
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:43,794
No, they're not.

237
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,992
Knowing them, they will.

238
00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:50,638
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

-T-minus 15 minutes!
-(ALL CHUCKLING)

00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:56,676
-Oh, did you hear from W“?
-Yeah, he's on his way.

241
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,109
Time for bladder check.

242
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,469
Check.

243
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,597
-Check.
-Check.

244
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:02,874
Wait.

245
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,395
Screw it. I'm holding it.

(PEOPLE BOOING)

247
00:13:07,719 --> 00:13:09,038
What is everyone booing at?

248
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,715
Hey, guys. What's up?

249
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,151
Uh... Hey, W“. What you doin'?

250
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,709
I was on Star Trek.
Just rooting for the home team.

251
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,874
MAN: Star Trek stinks!

252
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:26,797
Yeah? Live long and suck it!

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

254
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,636
SHELDON: Birthday girl?
Birthday girl? Birthday girl?

255
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,195
Come in!

256
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:44,874
Oh!

257
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,994
-Hi, Sheldon.
-He||o.

258
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,149
Sorry I'm Iate.

259
00:13:53,319 --> 00:13:54,957
I also got you a balloon,

260
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,872
but it floated away,
and I chased it for a while.

261
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,679
That's okay. Come on in.

262
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,115
Thank you.

263
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,711
Um, I'll just... I'm gonna go
put these in water.

264
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:05,153
Okay.

265
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,713
Oh! This is different.

266
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,871
Hmm. Candles and music.

267
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,995
Do you like it?

268
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,195
It's kind of spooky.

269
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,794
I can change it back.

270
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,393
No, no, no. It's your birthday.

271
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,393
And as long as no onejumps out
in a hockey mask, I'll be fine.

272
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:23,914
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

273
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,629
So...

274
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,871
What'd you have in mind for tonight?

275
00:14:29,439 --> 00:14:32,112
I thought I could take you out
to a nice birthday dinner.

276
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,158
Now, if we pick a place east of here,
we might find the balloon.

277
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:39,797
Um, that sounds nice,

278
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:42,473
but I'm not really hungry right now.

279
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,516
I thought, maybe,

280
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,753
-we could do presents first.
-Oh!

281
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,278
All right. Um...

282
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,952
I should probably tell you
something about this gift.

283
00:14:56,599 --> 00:14:59,397
You mean, before you...

284
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,875
Give it to me?

285
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,795
Yes.

286
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,072
May I ask you a question before I...

287
00:15:11,439 --> 00:15:12,474
Give it to you?

288
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:16,198
-Of course.
-Why are we saying

289
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,669
"give it to you" like that?

290
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,396
Sheldon,

291
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:24,798
I know your present is

292
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,595
for us to be intimate tonight.

293
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,272
I see.

294
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,195
Is that all right?

295
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:39,951
I'm sorry,
but this is a litigious society.

296
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,235
I'm gonna need verbal consent.

297
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:45,988
Yes.

298
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:49,995
You know what, let me
pull a quick contract off the Internet--

299
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,355
So, if you don't like Star Wars,
why are you here?

300
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,715
Oh, I'm just having fun.

301
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,393
Everyone takes Star Wars so seriously.

302
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,949
Like if the movie's bad,
it's gonna ruin their lives.

303
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,553
Is it bad? Did you hear something?

304
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,918
Oh, my God. It's bad. Somebody kill me.

305
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,277
See? That's what I mean.

306
00:16:11,439 --> 00:16:12,394
When you wake up in the morning,

307
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,994
whether this is the greatest movie ever
or a total piece of crap,

308
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,593
your life isn't gonna change at all.

309
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,589
He's right.

310
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:20,794
Yeah.

311
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:22,628
No matter what happens,

312
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:24,118
we're coming back tomorrow
to watch it again.

313
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,396
Do you think Sheldon's actuaIIy
gonna go through with it?

314
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,755
I don't know. He said he's ready.

315
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,273
Yeah, but he also swore this was the year

316
00:16:33,439 --> 00:16:35,350
he'd be able to
pull the guts out of a pumpkin.

317
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,434
Yeah, well, I'm gonna stay positive.

318
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,238
I mean, we talked.
I told him what women like.

319
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,674
And after he stopped giggling,
he seemed pretty sure of himself.

320
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,275
(CHUCKLES) Hi.

321
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,195
HeIIo.

322
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,671
So, um...

323
00:17:04,719 --> 00:17:06,198
Should I get under the covers with you?

324
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:09,188
All right.

325
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,675
-HeIIo--
-Hi!

326
00:17:34,439 --> 00:17:36,270
Why are you shaking? Are you cold?

327
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:39,627
I'm just... (EXHALES) Really nervous.

328
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,115
Why?

329
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,117
Well,

330
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:46,156
I've been waiting for this for so long,

331
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:49,436
I'vejust built it up in my head.

332
00:17:50,239 --> 00:17:52,309
I don't know what to expect.

333
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:54,836
Neither do I.

334
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:59,229
But, we can find out together.

335
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:03,268
Okay.

336
00:18:10,719 --> 00:18:11,754
I'm really nervous.

337
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,275
I know.

338
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,033
We've been waiting so long for this.

339
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,189
And we've built it up
in our heads so much.

340
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:24,910
Guys, it's just a movie.

341
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,555
-That's true.
-He's right.

342
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:27,788
-It is.
-(CHUCKLES)

343
00:18:28,239 --> 00:18:30,753
Although, we all remember Jar Jar.

344
00:18:32,639 --> 00:18:34,914
Leonard, I'm scared again.

345
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,350
Well, I enjoyed that
more than I thought I would.

346
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,749
Me, too.

347
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,039
I look forward to your next
birthday when we do it again.

348
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:02,478
That works for me!

349
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:05,676
I enjoyed that
more than I thought I would.

350
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,637
I don't think I can walk right now.

351
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:19,834
ARTHUR: Sheldon?

352
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,074
Sheldon.

353
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:23,514
Arthur.

354
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:24,953
What are you doing here?

355
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:27,997
|... |... I don't think
I need any more advice.

356
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,673
I... I was just curious.

357
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:34,114
How did it go?

358
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:40,908
It was amazing.

359
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,359
I... I saw it a few days later.

360
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,555
What a movie.

361
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,317
But, what... What about Amy?

362
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,708
Oh! Uh...

363
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:55,312
She liked it fine.

364
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,313
Yeah, but she doesn't have the history
with the franchise I do.

365
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,875
Okay.

366
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,469
Good... Good taIk.
