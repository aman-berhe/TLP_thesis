00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,432
I'm glad to see you made it safely.

2
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:06,708
How's your hotel?

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,916
It's not the best
Best Western I've been to,

4
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:11,438
but I'd say

5
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:14,075
it's the third-best
Best Western I've been to.

6
00:00:15,319 --> 00:00:16,388
I know how you feel.

7
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:19,955
The Best Buy by my house
is only the third-best Best Buy.

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,515
They have the best buys,
but having the best buys

9
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:26,279
isn't the only thing
that makes a Best Buy the best Best Buy.

10
00:00:28,919 --> 00:00:31,672
What makes a best Best Buy
the best Best Buy?

11
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,632
Hmm. That's a great question.

12
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,393
I like when they're next to a Chipotle.

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,193
Okay, well, I should unpack.

14
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,073
All right.
Enjoy the neurobiology conference.

15
00:00:42,279 --> 00:00:43,189
I Will.

16
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:45,435
I wish you were here.

17
00:00:46,319 --> 00:00:48,958
At a neurobiology conference?
What a mean thing to say.

18
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,913
Okay, I'm glad you're not here?

19
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,476
Aww. You always knowjust what to say
after I tell you what to say.

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,235
Good-bye, Sheldon.

21
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,475
-Bye.

22
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:03,437
Oh! Good news, gentlemen.

23
00:01:03,639 --> 00:01:05,311
Amy's at a conference this weekend,

24
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,193
which means I'm available
to be entertained.

25
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,752
As today's youth might put it,
who wants to get their Sheld—on?

26
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:15,990
Bernie and l are getting the house ready
for the remodel.

27
00:01:16,199 --> 00:01:17,791
We could always use
an extra pair of hands.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,797
That sounds awful. Raj?

29
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,033
Uh, I've got time booked
in the telescope room all weekend

30
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,389
scanning for rogue planets.

31
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,555
You're more than welcome to join me.

32
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,112
That's the one to beat. Leonard?

33
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,194
Oh. If anything,
I'm trying to get my Sheld—off.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,275
Well, then, it looks like
we have a winner. Congratulations.

35
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,273
Well, I should warn you,
it's just looking at data

36
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,037
for hours and hours on a computer screen.

37
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,037
Stop selling it, kid. You won.

Hi. How was your day?

41
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:12,312
Uh, not good.
Still couldn't get in to see Dr. Gallo.

42
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,034
A doctor? (GRUNTS)

43
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,034
Well, I hope you're not contagious.

44
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:18,592
I've got a weekend in the telescope room

45
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,631
I've been excited about
for almost three minutes.

46
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,909
I'm not sick. It's for work.

47
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,429
There's this doctor
who refuses to see any sales reps.

48
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:27,754
I've been trying to get in for months.

49
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,758
Well, did you try wearing the shirt
I said was inappropriate for work?

50
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:33,115
Well, the doctor's a woman,

51
00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:35,391
but yes, because you never know.

52
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:37,754
What kind of doctor is she?

53
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,678
Um. A psychiatrist. Why?

54
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:42,069
Well, what if you make
an appointment as a patient?

55
00:02:42,279 --> 00:02:43,473
Then you'll get to talk to her.

56
00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:45,790
Yeah, they already know
I'm a pharmaceutical sales rep.

57
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:49,309
Oh, what if Leonard made an appointment
and tried to lay some groundwork for you?

58
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:50,834
That's interesting.

59
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,674
Well, I'm not gonna make
a fake appointment with a psychiatrist.

60
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,028
What would I say is wrong with me?

61
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,355
-Low self-esteem.
-Social anxiety.

62
00:02:56,559 --> 00:02:57,548
Sexual insecurity.

63
00:03:00,119 --> 00:03:01,188
None of that is true.

64
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:03,435
Denial. See, sweetie,
the list goes on and on.

65
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,555
This is crazy.

66
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,159
How would my going in there even help you?

67
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:09,429
I don't know. You could talk to her,
and maybe if it comes up,

68
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:10,674
you could ask if she's heard
about the drug.

69
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,949
(SCOFFS) What if I get caught?

70
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,308
-Fear of failure!
-Lack of confidence!

71
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,509
Kind of a wuss!

72
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,949
Fine, I'll do it.

73
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,832
But not because of them,
because I love you.

74
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,950
Thank you.

the remodel is coming up,

95
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,716

on you guys and find my own place.

You know, my father took me to work once,

123

from the cash register.

Well, I'm not so sure about that.

160

But I can tell you I do not agree
with her theories on child rearing at all.

161
00:06:47,799 --> 00:06:48,993
Really?

162
00:06:49,559 --> 00:06:52,027
Any chance you find them
cold, cruel, and unsuitable

00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:54,275

who just want to be happy?

164
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,555
Well, I didn't want to say it...

to quite a bit of anger towards her.

a lot of that stuff. I'm better now.

Do you know she never let me
celebrate my birthday

171
00:07:10,559 --> 00:07:12,550
because being born
was her achievement, not mine?

172
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:15,114
That's heartbreaking.

we can be romantic in any room we want.

177
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:31,033
Great. I can finally show you
where the laundry room is.

178
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,110
Boy, who would've thought

179
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,276
when you asked me to move in
and help take care of your mom,

180
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,959
I'd still be here two years later?

181
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,833
-No one.
-Nobody thought that.

182
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,434
Well, that's it.

183
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,867
I guess so.

184
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,228
This is weird.

185
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,751
(CHUCKLES) Yeah. A grown man
moving into his own apartment.

186
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,358
It's crazy times. See ya!

187
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:58,948
Ignore him.

188
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:02,276
He's just using humor to express
how happy he is.

189
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,438
It's okay. I know he loves me.

190
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,188
Sure he does.

191
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:12,270
Well, let us know
when you're all settled in.

192
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,029
lwill. And I really can't
thank you guys enough.

193
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:17,758
-(ENG|NE STARTS)
-Our pleasure.

194
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:19,951
-Bye.
-Good luck!

195
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,395
HOWARD: He's gone!

196
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:24,827
Let's start in the garage!

197
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:27,874
(CHUCKLES)

198
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,679
Okay, so, once we receive the next image

199
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:39,835
and compare it to the ones
we've already collected,

200
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,189
we'll know what it is that we found.

201
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:44,712
Ooh, perhaps
it's a heliosheath scintillation.

202
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,797
Yeah, it could be
a trans-Neptunian object.

203
00:08:46,999 --> 00:08:48,796
(GASPS) Maybe it's a new planet.

204
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,116
Unlikely, but it could be a dwarf planet.

205
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,198
Well, as long as it has a healthy gravity
and all its moons, I'll be happy.

206
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,312
Okay, the final image is coming in.

207
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:00,192
And the object we discovered is...

208
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,355
Come on,

209
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,154
Daddy needs a livable planet
he can rule with an iron fist.

210
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,554
A medium-sized asteroid.

211
00:09:08,319 --> 00:09:10,355
That's it? How common.

212
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:13,278
That's the chicken fingers
on the menu of space.

213
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,509
I kind of like chicken fingers.

214
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,312
Yeah, me, too. I was stuck for a metaphor.

215
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,233
Come on, a medium-sized asteroid
is still an interesting discovery.

216
00:09:22,599 --> 00:09:23,588
I suppose it could end up

217
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,633
on a collision course with Earth
and destroy life as we know it.

218
00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:29,552
You dream different than me.

219
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,678
It is kind of cute.

220
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:35,551
Yeah, it is.
And you know we get to name it.

221
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:38,512
(EXCLAIMS) We better choose a name
no one can make fun of.

222
00:09:38,719 --> 00:09:41,552
Sir Friedrich William Herschel
didn't do Uranus any favors.

223
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:48,270
-Hi.
-Hey, how'd it go?

224
00:09:48,479 --> 00:09:51,198
Great. Dr. Gallo is terrific.

225
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,072
You know, I've always been insecure

226
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,396
that no one cares about what I have
to say, but she made me see--

227
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,397
Yeah, no one cares.
Did you help me out or not?

228
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,190
Okay, now, what I'm hearing

229
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,277
is that you feel that I sometimes
take too long to express myself,

230
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,038
and you wish I'd be more succinct.

231
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,993
You're only hearing that
because I cannot roll my eyes any louder.

232
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,633
All right, well, after we talked about
my issues with my mother,

233
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,751
nothing too deep,
just how she ruined my life,

234
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,274
I told her about you and your drug.
She said she'd be happy to meet you.

235
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,836
Really?
Oh! You're the best husband ever!

236
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,118
So, you'll go to the Doctor Who convention
with me next week?

237
00:10:25,439 --> 00:10:26,315
I guess.

238
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,273
Oh, I actually did hear
your eyes roll that time. (CHUCKLES)

239
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,595
(WHIRRING)

240
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:36,154
Boy, when was the last time
Stuart cleaned this place?

241
00:10:36,359 --> 00:10:37,269
No kidding.

242
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:38,992
Oh. Okay, I'm about to suck something up.

243
00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:40,837
What do you think this object sounds like?

244
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,793
Howie, I don't want to play
Lego, Toenail or Pill anymore.

245
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,070
So, what do you think
we should do with this room?

246
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,555
Well, l was thinking
a home theater or a gaming room,

247
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:52,431
you know, like a man cave.

248
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,914
Why can't it be a woman cave?

249
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,838
As long as it has a home
theater, a video game system

250
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:56,950
and you're not allowed in it,

251
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,388
you can call it whatever you want.

252
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:01,147
I'm being serious.

253
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:03,276
Well, what do you think we should do?

254
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,313
I don't know, maybe a home office or...

255
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,113
on... (EXHALES)

256
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,715
Look.

257
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:12,434
The teddy bear Stuart won
the night we took him to the fair.

258
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:13,958
(CHUCKLES)

259
00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:16,077
He was so excited.

260
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,635
Yeah.

261
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:19,153
You know, no matter how hard they tried,

262
00:11:19,359 --> 00:11:20,917
they could not guess his age.

263
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,556
I'll give it to him next time | see him.

264
00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:27,155
-Have you heard from him since he left?
-No.

265
00:11:27,439 --> 00:11:30,192
You'd think he would've called
once he got settled in.

266
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:32,715
-Maybe he's busy.
-Too busy to call?

267
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,071
He wasn't too busy to binge-watch
Hot in Cleveland with my Hulu password.

268
00:11:39,319 --> 00:11:40,354
What is happening?

269
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,677
Are we missing him?

270
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,514
No, that's not what this feeling is.

271
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:47,634
Is it?

272
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:50,595
Of course not. He drove us crazy.

273
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,030
Like when you were gonna make that pie

274
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,629
and Stuart ate all the blueberries. God!

275
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,513
And he tried to deny it,
but his teeth were all purple.

276
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:02,477
-That was pretty cute.
-(CHUCKLES)

277
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,955
Yeah.

278
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:06,158
Ew, we are missing him!

279
00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:12,229
So I was thinking,
maybe we can come up with a name

280
00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:14,634
for the asteroid by combining our names.

281
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,068
That's a great idea.

282
00:12:16,439 --> 00:12:17,349
I've got it.

283
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,312
We'll call it Cooper.

284
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,679
How is that both our names?

285
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,833
"Koo" from Koothrappali
and "per" from Cooper.

286
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:29,990
Yeah, so it's, like, Kooper with a "K"?

287
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,595
Nah, you're right, that's dumb.

288
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:35,276
-Hey.
-Leonard, great news.

289
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,597
We discovered
a medium-sized asteroid together.

290
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,233
Wow! That's amazing!

291
00:12:40,439 --> 00:12:42,191
I'm in a pretty great mood today myself.

292
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,355
Okay. Guess we're gonna
talk about you now.

293
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,918
Well, we are,
because Dr. Gallo made me realize

294
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,634
that I'm a worthwhile person
and that my feelings matter.

295
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,599
I learned that for free
from a cat poster, but good for you.

296
00:12:56,599 --> 00:12:57,509
Okay, back to me.

297
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,280
I discovered an asteroid,
and now | get to name it.

298
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,879
Wait, what happened to us?

299
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,109
Now, this isn't about us,

300
00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:05,037
this is about what's best
for the asteroid.

301
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,515
What are you thinking of naming it?

302
00:13:08,719 --> 00:13:10,232
I haven't settled on anything yet.

303
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:11,952
We haven't settled on anything yet.

304
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,718
All right, way to go, Cat Poster.
You hang in there.

305
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,112
You know what'd be nice?
Name it after your girlfriends.

306
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:19,354
Show them how much you care.

307
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,796
-That is a great idea.
-It's perfect.

308
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:24,990
It appears romantic, but it's reallyjust

309
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,714
a rock in space that gets me
out of Valentine's Day forever.

310
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,310
So, uh, what were you thinking?
Combine their names?

311
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,555
Mmm. I like it.

312
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:36,512
Yeah, we'll take the "A-M" from Amy

313
00:13:36,719 --> 00:13:38,152
and the "Y" from Emily.

314
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,675
That's just Amy.

315
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,552
Exactly. See how well we work together?

316
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:47,547
And in double-blind studies,

317
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:49,750
Placinex proved
extremely effective in treating

318
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:51,392
all kinds of anxiety.

319
00:13:51,599 --> 00:13:53,510
Actually, funny story, the boys in the lab

320
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,234
were worried about getting
FDA approval for Placinex.

321
00:13:56,439 --> 00:13:58,191
They started taking it, stopped worrying.

322
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,355
So...

323
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,989
Got it.

324
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,268
Do you have any questions?

325
00:14:02,479 --> 00:14:03,673
-Just one.
-M m m-h m m.

326
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,432
When you made your husband
pretend to be a patient

327
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,473
so you could get access to me,
what were you thinking there?

328
00:14:12,439 --> 00:14:15,033
ljust meant a question about the drug.

329
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,790
Yeah, I know what you meant.

330
00:14:17,999 --> 00:14:21,912
Let's put that aside for a minute
and talk about why you married Leonard.

331
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,074
(SOFTLY) I don't wanna.

332
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,310
Here is a man
raised by an overbearing woman

333
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,751
who completely dominated
every aspect of his formative years.

334
00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:33,513
Do you think

335
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:37,838
he's perpetuating that relationship
by seeking out a partner like you?

336
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,512
You know, I used to wear tank tops a lot.

337
00:14:42,719 --> 00:14:44,232
That was a big selling point.

338
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,709
Hi, Sheldon. What's up?

339
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:51,469
Good news. You're an asteroid.

340
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,199
Uh. Please tell me what to say next.

341
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,949
Perhaps I should explain.

342
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:01,478
While working with Koothrappali,

343
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,831
we discovered an asteroid,
and I named it after you.

344
00:15:05,479 --> 00:15:06,753
on. (CHUCKLES)

345
00:15:07,319 --> 00:15:10,675
Sheldon, thank you. That's so romantic.

346
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:12,153
But what about Rajesh?

347
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,157
He was okay with you choosing the name?

348
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,920
Well, it took a little negotiating,
but I wore him down.

349
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,269
We get the asteroid,

350
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,072
and if you and l have children,

351
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,077
they all have to be named Rajesh.

352
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,635
All of them?

353
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:26,874
Even the girls.

354
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:31,436
Okay, I think I know what to say now.

355
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,273
How can I not sound like his mother

356
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,471
when our entire bedroom
is filled with Star Wars toys?

357
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,399
I mean, have you ever had sex
with a stuffed Wookiee watching you?

358
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,148
I went to college in the '70s.
It was a hairier time.

359
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,509
I'm gonna say yes.

360
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,109
You know, if anything,
he's turning me into his mother.

361
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:51,435
Before I did pharmaceutical sales,
l was an actress.

362
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,033
You know, I was pretty good.

363
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,595
You know, girl-next-door type, but hot.

364
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,909
Doable.

365
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:58,754
Hmm.

366
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,393
And not only am | Leonard's mother,

367
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,114
but we have this man-child
living with us named Sheldon.

368
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,908
Oh, Leonard talked a lot about him.

369
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,759
I wasn't sure if he was real.

370
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,398
Yeah, he's as real as the fine I get

371
00:16:11,599 --> 00:16:13,271
when I use too much toilet paper.

372
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,793
Wow. You really do have
a lot on your plate.

373
00:16:17,999 --> 00:16:19,512
(SIGHS) I do.

374
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,551
You know, Leonard's right.

375
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,193
Talking to you is really helping.

376
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,799
Oh, I'm glad.

377
00:16:25,999 --> 00:16:29,674
You know, you might also benefit
from a prescription for anxiety.

378
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:31,398
Okay, if you think it'll help.

379
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:33,078
Oh! Just don't make it Placinex.

380
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,395
I do not need
sudden fits of homicidal rage.

381
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:40,874
I miss you.

382
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,479
I miss you as well.

383
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:44,551
I can't believe I miss Stuart.

384
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,117
I guess ljust miss when life was simpler.

385
00:16:47,319 --> 00:16:49,355
ALL: Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard!

386
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,993
Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard!

387
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,235
Remember, girls,
you decide what makes you happy,

388
00:16:53,439 --> 00:16:55,350
not your emotionally withholding mothers.

389
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,911
Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard!

390
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,714
Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard! Go, Leonard!

391
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,795
(INHALES DEEPLY)

392
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,149
(SOFTLY) I really miss this.

393
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,629
