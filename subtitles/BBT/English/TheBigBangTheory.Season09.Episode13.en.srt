00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,397
Hey, so I saw a movie trailer
the other day.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,477
How could Batman possibly fight Superman?

3
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:08,998
I mean, isn't that dumb?

4
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:10,268
Maybe he uses Kryptonite.

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:11,878
Well, Batman's got a lot of money,

6
00:00:12,079 --> 00:00:14,547
maybe he builds a suit
that can do everything Superman can do.

7
00:00:15,079 --> 00:00:17,513
No, no, no. I've seen that movie,
it's called Iron Man.

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,869
BERNADETTE: What do you do
when Batman wins?

9
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:24,989
EMILY: Well, it depends on...

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,473
What is happening?

11
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,628
I don't know.

12
00:00:29,959 --> 00:00:31,677
But it's beautiful.

13
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:34,637
Yeah, and now Ben Affleck is Batman?

14
00:00:34,839 --> 00:00:36,591
Oh, he was great in Shakespeare in Love.

15
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:38,198
Ooh, we should
watch that next girls' night.

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,358
We could do a double-feature with
the Leonardo DiCaprio Romeo and Juliet.

17
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,993
Oh, I love me some Leo.

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,553

19
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,233
Oh, hello, everyone. lam happy
to report I'm feeling much better.

20
00:00:50,999 --> 00:00:52,432
-Good for you.
-Yeah, yeah.

21
00:00:52,639 --> 00:00:55,437
My fever is gone,
my sinuses are pressure-free,

22
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:58,676
and my mucus is as clear
as a Yosemite waterfall.

23
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:01,628
Glad to hear it.

24
00:01:03,639 --> 00:01:05,755
I'll be able to return to work tomorrow.

25
00:01:07,039 --> 00:01:08,074
Yay.

26
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:11,671

You really don't know why?

29
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:20,552
No. But I knew that
his "yay" was sarcastic.

30
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:24,708
It was not bad for a guy whose last bowel
movement sounded like rain on a roof.

31
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,833
Let me refresh your memory.

I made your bed.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,592
I checked your mouth for thrush.

35
00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:42,752
You can rub your own chest.

36
00:01:43,559 --> 00:01:46,631
Sure, grope every other man on the planet
but draw the line with me.

37
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,351
I brought you
a little care package from work.

38
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,949
It's our latest anti-viral and
the best decongestant we make.

39
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,953
I hope laughter is the best medicine,
'cause this care package is ajoke.

I went to medical school.

45

Well, in that case, try removing

standing next to you.

-Hi, Sheldon.
-Hello.

55
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,513
Are you feeling any better?

56
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,358
Physically yes, but I'm upset because
everyone's mad at me for no good reason.

57
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,711
Why don't you tell me what happened,
and in a gentle, loving way,

you're allowed to be cranky
and say whatever you want

(SIGHS) Gentle and loving,
this is gonna be tricky.

63
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:44,471
I had a 101 fever.

If that's not a time to
verbally abuse my loved ones, when is?

Sheldon, when you're sick
you can be unbearable.

And that's why your friends
have been known to work late,

his comics the other day,

he said, "Oh, great,
death is literally at my door."

He was being ajerk to everyone,
don't take it personally.

Oh, I'm on so many antidepressants,
I couldn't if I wanted to.

-No. No!
-No. No!

everyone going to Vegas.

Not this time.

Okay, Isaid, "What's new, " but sure.

126
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,078
Can you believe they planned a trip
to Las Vegas and didn't invite me?

127
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,075
Did you refuse to apologize and act like
they were stupid for being mad?

you were nothing but mean to them.

I can't believe you're not on my side.

with a heart of gold?

Sheldon, I understand that you're upset
because you feel left out,

136
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,873
but I don't know why we're even talking
about this. Just apologize to them.

137
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,674
Fine, if that's what it takes
to go on their dumb trip.

138
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,476
Maybe you could try apologizing
because you actually feel bad.

00:07:29,239 --> 00:07:31,878
It's called empathy.
It's something you could work on.

l have empathy. Now watch.

141
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,470
Leonard made me soup
and l was mean to him.

Great.

143
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:45,512
Now try it as if
this isn't your ﬁrst day as a person.

144
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:51,028
Fine. Leonard made me soup
and l was mean to him.

145

Wait, wait, let me try again.

Leonard made me soup
and l was mean to him.

147
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,311
l was mean to him.

148
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,879
He must've felt terrible.
Oh, now | feel terrible.

149
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,109
Neat!

150
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,428
Glad I could help.

151
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,948
Now let me see you feel bad for lying

152
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:16,229
and staying in Detroit
longer than you needed to.

153
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,519
I feel so, so bad.

154
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:22,236
Hey, we're both great at this!

155
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,555
Leonard, get ready for an apology.

156
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,873
And with the added twist of an M. Night
Shyamalan movie, I'm going to mean it.

157
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,955
Ah, so like every other
M. Night Shyamalan movie I've seen,

158
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,037
you spoil it in advance.

159

was dead the whole time, that's not on me.

160
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:50,714
Okay. Here it comes. You tried
to take care of me when l was sick

161
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,911
and l was mean to you.

162
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,589
There's no excuse for that,
and I'm truly sorry.

163

Thank you, I appreciate that.

164
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:02,717
And I want you to know that
that is sincere. I do feel bad.

165
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,638
l'm notjust saying it
to be included on your trip.

166
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,110
I appreciate that, too.

167
00:09:07,319 --> 00:09:09,753
Terrific. Now, all that's left
is for you to invite me to come,

168
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,520
me to ask, "Are you sure?"
You to say, "Absolutely."

169
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,598
And then me to bring it home with,
"How could I say no to that face."

170
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:18,148
You're still not coming.

171
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,190
But I apologized and I meant it.

172
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,392
I know that we don't play this game
very often, but you're doing it wrong.

173
00:09:25,319 --> 00:09:28,356
Sheldon, I accept your apology, but you
upset a lot of people while you were sick.

174
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,437
I'm not in a position
to just say you can come.

175
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,189
Well, all right.

176
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,631
What if I apologize to all of them?

177
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,558
Fine. If you apologize to everyone

178
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:39,715
and they all say it's okay,
then yes, you can come.

179
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,954
Challenge accepted! Sounds like it's time
for the Sheldon Cooper Apology Tour!

183
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,994
Howard and Bernadette,
you tried to comfort me when l was ill

184
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:09,191
and I treated you terribly. I'm sorry.

185
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:12,830
Wow. (CHUCKLES) I'm impressed.

186
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,510

All you did was offer
maternal care and affection,

196
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:00,398
and all you received in return
was rude and insensitive behavior.

197
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,272
Can this wait?

198
00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:07,114
I'm afraid it can't. The trip is tomorrow
and l have more apologies to make.

199
00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:09,150
Okay, fine, I accept your apology,
now get out!

200
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,590
Wonderful. Now would you mind
holding up this shirt while l--

You brought me my comic books
when I wasn't feeling well.

203
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:23,638
That, that was thoughtful and
l was insensitive. I'm sorry.

204
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:27,109
Thank you, Sheldon. I appreciate that.

205
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,556
And, now, I want you to know
that I mean it.

206

This isn't me just wanting to
go on the trip to Las Vegas.

on the party bus.

209
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,671
Of course I wasn't invited.

210
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,037
That would be my understanding.

211
00:11:50,999 --> 00:11:54,230
On a less painful subject,
what size T-shirt do you take?

212
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,870
Raj, you were being a good friend

213
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,628
and my illness was no excuse
for my behavior.

214
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,070
I hope that you can accept my apology.

215
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,314
Of course I do.

216
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:13,035
And Emily, I'm sorry for saying
dermatologists aren't real doctors.

217

And I'm sure you're tired of hearing that.

218
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,350
Do you honestly think I hear that a lot?

219
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,716

221
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:31,432
Okay. Okay, the point is
that we accept your apology.

222
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:34,312
Look, maybe you do.
Hejust insulted me again.

223
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,873
Yeah, but he doesn't mean it.

224
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,432
Why are you defending him?

225
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:39,038
Well, I believe I can answer that.

226
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,959
Uh, like me, Raj is demonstrating empathy.

227
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:47,234
Now, why don't you accept my apology,
you receive your free T-shirt...

What are you doing?

232
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,400
It's called standing up for myself.
You should try it sometime.

233
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,318
Fine, how about this?
You're making me uncomfortable

234
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,272
by prolonging this ridiculous fight
and lwish you'd stop.

235
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,991
You want me to stop? No problem.

236
00:13:09,319 --> 00:13:10,718
No, come on. No, please don't leave.

237
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,912
Point of clarification, are you still
going on the trip? Because if not--

238
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,633
Don't worry, you're good.

239
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,156
I caused that fight, I feel terrible.

240
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,550
(STAMMERS) Wait, I can do that better.

241
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,680
I caused that fight, I feel terrible.

242
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:31,229
Yeah, wow, I don't know
which one I like more.

243
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,032
So, was the fight really bad?

244
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,959
Well, no. As a fight, it was excellent.

245
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,879
You know, she used harsh language
and slammed the door.

246
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,470
Although, as I say this, that might not
have been what you were asking.

247
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,039
You think they'll still go on the trip?

248
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,276
All I know is after the fight
I went to Emily's to smooth--

249
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,232
-They're not going on the trip.
-No.

250
00:13:54,359 --> 00:13:55,678
What is wrong with you?

251
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,113
Look at him.
Caring about what's wrong with me.

252
00:13:59,319 --> 00:14:01,037
That is some top shelf empathy.

253
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,838
Hey, well, we should start a club.

254
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,513
You went to Emily's to apologize
and when you left she was crying.

255
00:14:11,239 --> 00:14:13,992
That is true. I suppose
I should apologize again.

256
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,713
-ALL: No!
-Stop.

257
00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:18,193
Is she okay?

258
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,278
Yeah. I calmed her down but
she's not going to Vegas if he's going.

259
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,514
Wait, that's an option?
I didn't know that was an option.

260
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:29,916
Well, that is fine, because I've decided
that I won't be joining you.

261
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,994
I've realized that the most genuine way
to demonstrate the remorse | feel is

262
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:36,588
to let you have this weekend
to yourselves.

263
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:39,358
That's very mature of you.

264
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,989

a little trip myself recently.

but one of my nose plugs
fell into the toilet.

282

You couldn't give us just one weekend?

283
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,316
I told him this was a bad idea.

284
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,079
What do we do, kick them off?

285

291

l'm considered an odd fellow.

00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,669

while I often say the wrong thing,

293
