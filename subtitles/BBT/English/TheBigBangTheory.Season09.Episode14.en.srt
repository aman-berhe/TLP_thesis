00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,192
Here's a fun postal fact.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,871
You know, the inside of our mailbox
is under federal jurisdiction,

3
00:00:10,079 --> 00:00:12,149
so if you broke my right thumb,

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,911
that's the Pasadena City Police, but if
you broke my left thumb, that's the FBI.

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,870
If I'm going tojail, l'm killing him,
not breaking his thumb.

6
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:22,592
Yeah.

7
00:00:22,999 --> 00:00:26,355
Ooh, I got a letter from my Meemaw.
(SNIFFS) Mmm. Smell this.

8
00:00:26,919 --> 00:00:28,398
(SNIFFS) What is that?

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,830
Roses, BENGAY and
Dr. Scholl's Foot Powder.

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,918
Ah, yup. Grandma by Calvin Klein.

11
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,712
You know, the last time
I got a handwritten letter

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,798
was from someone who told me
I park like a blind person.

13
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:42,432
LEONARD: That someone has a name.

14
00:00:42,639 --> 00:00:44,231
SHELDON: Uh, thank you.

15
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,437
Oh, Meemaw got a new set of teeth.

16
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,951
Oh, but then she found her old ones.

17
00:00:51,839 --> 00:00:54,558
Oh, so now the new ones
are just gonna be her church teeth.

18
00:00:55,999 --> 00:00:59,196
Fun, like your Comic-Con Spock ears
and your around-the-house Spock ears.

19
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:03,552
PENNY: I park fine.

20
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,874
Oh, my goodness, she's coming to visit!

21
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:10,228
Oh, it'll be nice to finally meet her.

22
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:11,952
Oh, you are going to love her.

23
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,038
She is the kindest, sweetest woman
you'll ever meet.

24
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,674
Unless you're a gopher
digging up her vegetable garden.

25
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:21,912
In that case you can expect to have
your head bashed in with a shovel.

26
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:25,276
(THEME SONG PLAYING)

27
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,875
That's not her, that's not her,
that's not her,

28
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:57,757
that's not her, that's not her, that's
not her, that's not her, that's not her.

29
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:00,473
Really? The old Asian man
is not your Meemaw?

30
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,632
And that's not helpful.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,231
I got her an iPhone for Christmas,
I'll see where she is.

32
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,278
Oh, that's nice, most people her age
don't embrace technology.

33
00:02:11,559 --> 00:02:12,833
Oh, she doesn't even know she has it.

34
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,999
No, I had my sister slip it in her bag
so that I can track her like a sea turtle.

35
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,597
Same as when we lost you at the zoo.

36
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,997
For the hundredth time, | smelled
kettle corn and couldn't find the cart.

37
00:02:26,559 --> 00:02:29,551
That still doesn't explain
how you ended up on a freeway divider.

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,228
Moon Pie!

39
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,715
(GASPS) Meemaw! I'm so happy to see you!

40
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:37,672
I'm so happy to see you, too! (CHUCKLES)

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,150
Oh, you got even smaller, I love it!

42
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,675
Meemaw, this is Leonard.
Leonard, this is my Meemaw.

43
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:46,712
Hi, so nice to finally meet you.
Let me take this for you, Meemaw.

44
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:48,113
Thank you.

45
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,550
Oh, no. Now, you call her Constance.
I call her Meemaw.

46
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,558
You have your own Meemaw. It's not
my fault she died when you were four.

47
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,348
Is that nice to say to your friend?

48
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,868
It isn't, Meemaw. Sorry, Leonard.

49
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,229
-Can you please live with us forever?
-(LAUGH|NG)

50
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,995
That's ridiculous,
if you had a super power

51
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,760
and spent your whole life
being told to suppress it,

52
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:18,556
when you finally decide to embrace
that power, why hide in isolation?

53
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,909
I'm sorry, and how much money
did your version of Frozen make?

54
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,998
I'm just saying, instead of Let It Go,

55
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,839
she should really sing Look At Me
Hiding in a Freezer Like a DOVEBAR.

56
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,427
She built an ice castle,
made a snow monster

57
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:36,233
and gave herself
a complete makeover in one day.

58
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,714
You know what I saw you do today?

59
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,955
Eat a block of cream cheese
straight from the foil

60
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,593
and lie about it to your wife.

61
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,189
Sorry for eavesdropping,

62
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,994
but did you know they actually had
the song Let It Go in place

63
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,872
before they finalized the story?

64
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,831
Yeah, that's true.
In fact, they liked the song so much

65
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,473
they retooled the whole script around it.

66
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,432
Which is probably why that movie sucks.

67
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,675
(CHUCKLES) Here we are talking
about Frozen and yet you got burned.

68
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,558
I'm so sorry,
but how can you not like that movie?

69
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,557
ljust think it gets more credit
than it deserves.

70
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,751
-Ah, that's what I said an hour ago.
-Wow.

71
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,389
You've been talking
about Frozen for an hour?

72
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,076
You should've seen us after
The Good Dinosaur.

73
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,590
It was a classic western
set in the post-Jurassic period,

74
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,153
and it changed my life.

75
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,154
Are you comfortable?

76
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,956
Very. It's nice to rest
after 800 flights of stairs.

77
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,194

(GASPS) There's Amy.
ljust know you're gonna hit it off.

80
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,875
You both have the same fashion sense.

81
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,590
Hello! Come in and say hi to my Meemaw.

82
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,553
-Hi, nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, too.

83
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:50,874
How was your trip?

84
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,312
Wonderful, and the pilot did
such a good job I gave him a butterscotch.

85
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,953
That's great. And look at you,
sitting in Sheldon's spot.

86
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,071
-You know, I don't even get to sit there.
-Yeah.

87
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,193

do it, ask her.

-Of course.

93
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:22,431
He's been saying that since he was little.
I still don't know what it means.

94
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,959
Well, you two sit down and get to
know each other. I'll get your room ready.

95
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,391
Oh, now don't you go looking through
my suitcase for presents.

96
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,670
-If I did would I find any?
-Maybe.

97
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:35,076
But you might also find
my brassieres and bloomers.

98
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,797
That's a risk I'm willing to take!

Okay, now let's you and me
get something straight.

He may think
that I came to bake him cookies,

102
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,075
but the real reason is to size you up.

but I'm not so easy.

a little magic in my life.

00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,307
I wouldn't say she's beautiful.

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,358
Really? You don't think she's attractive?

142
00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:48,390
I do, | just wouldn't tell my girlfriend.

I can't pour you some wine?

Oh, no wine for me.

Thank you, Moon Pie.

00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,272
I'm curious, why do you
call Sheldon "Moon Pie"?

150
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,033
Because he's so nummy-nummy--

-She could just eat him up.
-She could just eat him up.

152
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,072

-well, just look at her.

know about his nickname

and you don't.

156
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,039
Oh, well, now that I'm hearing it,
it does sound familiar.

157
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:34,749
How could it? I never told you
and you never bothered to ask.

158
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:36,358
Well, now I know.

159
00:08:39,239 --> 00:08:41,799
So, Penny, I understand
you have a newjob.

can have it all.

and a full-time career, too.

You just said it's okay for her to work.

00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,353
Well, Leonard doesn't need
as much tending to as Sheldon does.

167
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:11,394
And as Moon Pie explained, (CHUCKLES)
Leonard's work is more of a hobby.

168
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,238
-That's my best friend.
-Yeah.

169
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,199
Look, | get that you're protective
of your grandson,

170
00:09:20,439 --> 00:09:22,669
but he's an adult now, and maybe

171
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:24,870
I understand what he needs
better than you do.

172
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:27,547
I appreciate your honesty, dear.

173
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,514
-Thank you.
-And here's some more honesty.

174
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,836
I don't like you very much.

175
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:36,398
Well, maybe I don't like you either.

176
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,592
No, no, no. You have to like each other.

177
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,109
Well, we have a 4:30 reservation
at Applebee's.

178
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,357
lthink I should leave.

179
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,314
Why? Other than you two fighting,
we're having such a good time.

180
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:54,033
The minute you left the room

181
00:09:54,239 --> 00:09:56,992
your precious Meemaw
started giving me a really hard time.

182
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,315
You know, I don't need this.

183
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:03,309
Let her go. And under no circumstance
will you give her that engagement ring.

184
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,468
What ring?

185
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,233
Maybe we should give them some privacy.

186
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You go ahead, l'll catch up with you.

187
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,118
You have an engagement ring?

188
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,195
Yes.

189
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:20,352
Penny, did you know about this?

190
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,113
All right, let's go.

191
00:10:29,719 --> 00:10:31,471
When did you get an engagement ring?

192
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,829
Well, my mother gave it to me

193
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,998
and I had been thinking about
giving it to you, but then we broke up.

194
00:10:36,199 --> 00:10:37,837
Well, thank goodness for that.

195
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,308
Sheldon, will you please tell
your grandmother to stay out of this?

196
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,589
Oh, I don't think I could do that.

197
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:47,947
Sheldon, tell this girl that my ring
will never be on her finger.

198
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,117
Yeah, I'm gonna opt out of that one, too.

199
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,909
You know, who said
I even want to be engaged to him?

200
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,077
And if I do,
I don't need your hand-me-downs!

201
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:01,353
All right, look. Let's remain calm
and analyze this situation.

202
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,711
You know, I realize that you've only
known each other for less than a day,

203
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,674
but is it possible this crankiness is
because your cycles have synced?

204
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:13,755
You leave the room
and let the grown-ups talk. Now!

205
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,316
Don't speak to him like he's a child!

206
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,917
Thank you. Now I'm gonna go next door
and play with Leonard.

207
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,430
Okay, so you met this girl,
you exchanged numbers

208
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:26,674
and you're gonna meet up with her.

209
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:28,392
Just to help her with her screenplay.

210
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,919
Well, I guess that's not so bad.

211
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,396
You weren't there, he was really flirting.

212
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,831
Hey, it's not my fault if American women
project their fantasies

213
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:39,111
on foreigners with the kind of
magical voice that grants wishes.

214
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,999
I'm sure it was harmless.
People flirt, no big deal.

215
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,158
-Really? So it's okay if I flirt--
-Not you, I own your ass.

216
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:51,469
The real question is,
where are you with Emily?

217
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,432
Uh, it's hard to say, I think we're good.

218
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,790
But things like this make me wonder
if Emily's really the right person for me.

219
00:11:57,999 --> 00:11:59,717
I mean, did you guys ever
have doubts about each other?

220
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,671
-No, never.
-Absolutely.

221
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,229
What?

222
00:12:03,439 --> 00:12:05,634
Howie, you forget how much
of our early dates involved

223
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,955
you doing magic and me doing this.

224
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,150
Fine. I had reservations about you, too.

225
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,396
-No, you didn't.
-No, I didn't.

226
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:19,227
Well, it doesn't matter now,
'cause I love how things worked out.

227
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,594
Me, too. I think you're
even more beautiful than this rose.

228
00:12:29,439 --> 00:12:32,192
Wow. You know,
the last time I saw my grandma,

229
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,072
the most exciting thing was watching
the ash of her cigarette get longer

230
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,190
and wondering if it was gonna
fall in her pudding.

231
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:39,869
Did it?

232
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,035
Yeah, right in there,
she ate it and everything.

233
00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:44,354
-(KNOCK ON DOOR)
-SHELDON: Leonard and Penny?

234
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,198
Leonard and Penny?
Leonard and Penny?

235
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,594
Come in!

236
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,593
Hey, what happened? ls Amy gone?

237
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,156
No, they asked me to leave
so they could speak privately.

238
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,277
-Uh-oh.
-Yeah, I know, it was quite tense.

239
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,550
So here's the million-dollar question.

240
00:12:57,759 --> 00:12:59,909
Who wants to pop over there
and get my trains?

241
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,671
All right, I've made up my mind.

242
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:07,392
I'm gonna do the right thing,
call this girl,

243
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,113
and let her know
that I'm in a relationship.

244
00:13:09,319 --> 00:13:12,152
Okay, so far we've heard,
"Made up my mind, I'm dumping Emily."

245
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,591
"Made up my mind to date both of them
by pretending to be twin brothers."

246
00:13:17,599 --> 00:13:19,078
And, "Made up my mind,
I'll ask for a threesome,

247
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,395
"and if they say no,
I'll play it off as ajoke."

248
00:13:22,319 --> 00:13:26,107
I'm calling her. And the threesome
didn't deserve the belly laugh it got.

249
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,074
You're right. It could totally happen.
(LAUGHING)

250
00:13:31,359 --> 00:13:32,553
-CLA|RE: Hello?
-Hi.

251
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,758
Hi, yeah, it's Raj.
Rajesh, we met at the comic book store.

252
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:37,955
Hey, what's up?
Figure out what time you're free?

253
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,991
Actually, that's why I'm calling. I, um...

254
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,038
ljust, I need to let you know
that l have a girlfriend.

255
00:13:43,599 --> 00:13:44,827
Okay, good for you.

256
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,033
Well, no, no, I didn't want to mislead you
after you asked me out.

257
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,478
I didn't ask you out,
ljust need help with my screenplay.

258
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,996
Wait, are you saying
that we didn't have a vibe?

259
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,315
Why do you care if we have a vibe?
You have a girlfriend.

260
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,793
Come on, ljust told you
l have a girlfriend,

261
00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:00,910
the least you can do is tell me
if we had a vibe.

262
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,360
-Sure, we had a vibe.
-I knew it! Okay, we did have a vibe.

263
00:14:06,319 --> 00:14:08,549
This is exciting, what's my next move?

264
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:10,034
You still have a girlfriend.

265
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:11,913
Right. Good catch.

266
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:16,674
Anyway, so I'm sorry to waste your time,
and good luck with your screenplay.

267
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:18,597
Hang on. We're both adults,

268
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,916
we can still get together
without it meaning anything.

269
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,476
Not me. Ever since you admitted we had
a vibe I've been planning our wedding.

270
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,753
Look. It's just coffee.

271
00:14:29,239 --> 00:14:33,198
I'll ask you some questions about science
and if you propose, I promise to say "no."

272
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:35,989
Okay. Well that hurts a little, but okay.
(CHUCKLES)

273
00:14:37,599 --> 00:14:39,317
-Great, l'll text you.
-Bye!

274
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:43,871
All right. So, we're meeting for coffee,
like two adults.

275
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,877
Everybody's happy, easy-peasy.

276
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,429
Are you gonna tell Emily?

277
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,757
Yeah, of course, we have no secrets.

278
00:14:50,719 --> 00:14:52,152
When are you gonna tell Emily?

279
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,993
He lied about the cream cheese,
he ate the whole thing, I saw him!

280
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,358
Look, I know you think I'm not right for
Sheldon, but trust me, I'm his best shot.

281
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,318
You have no idea how much I put up with.

282
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,511
I know more than you think I do.

283
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:11,154
Really? You know what it's like
to have date night ruined

284
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,918
because Google changed their font?

285
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,675
Young lady. If you think
I don't know what it's like

286
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:21,349
to live with a stubborn, egotistical man,
then you're wrong.

287
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,279
'Cause that was my husband.

288
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,515
Really?

289
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:29,476
(SIGHS) There were days I wanted
to fill his pockets with corn

290
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,272
and toss him in the pig pen.

291
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,035
Well, if you understand, then why are you
giving me such a hard time?

292
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:40,197
Because when you broke up with Sheldon
it hurt him deeply,

293
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,516
and I don't wanna see that happen again.

294
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,755
(DOOR OPENS)

295
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,757
Hi, sorry. Sheldon would like to say
something to you.

296
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,797
-SHELDON: No, lwouldn't.
-Just get in here.

297
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,399
-Hello.
-Go ahead.

298
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,032
Meemaw, I'm sorry, but...

299
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,034
l have to defend my girlfriend to you.

300
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,875
Oh, Sheldon, thank you.

301
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:04,671
Oh, great, now you're gonna get emotional.

302
00:16:10,439 --> 00:16:12,350
| always looked up to you and Pop-Pop.

303
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,394
I know what a challenging man he could be,

304
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:19,552
but I saw you stand by him and
make him into a better person.

305
00:16:19,999 --> 00:16:20,954
ldid.

306
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,833
Well, that is exactly what I've been doing
the last five years

307
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,031
with this little work in progress.

308
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,917
He never disappoints, does he?

309
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,593
I think what Sheldon means to say,

310
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,192
is we've both grown together.
Isn't that right?

311
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,589
-We||--
-Say yes!

312
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:40,834
Yes.

313
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,549
Fine. If you feel so strongly,
I won't stand in your way.

314
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,309
Thank you.

315
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,239
So if he wanted to give me
that engagement ring,

316
00:16:50,439 --> 00:16:51,997
we would have your blessing?

317
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:53,913
I suppose.

318
00:16:59,359 --> 00:17:01,748
| just gave you my virginity,
woman, cool yourjets!

319
00:17:09,719 --> 00:17:14,315
Yeah, see, if you just change the story
to the destruction of a galaxy,

320
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,676
then a super massive
black hole could work.

321
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,713
(SCOFFS) This is great. Thank you so much.

322
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,072
| just gotta figure out a way

323
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,111

00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:33,437
