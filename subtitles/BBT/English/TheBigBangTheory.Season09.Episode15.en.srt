1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,555
Gentlemen.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:05,670
LEONARD: Hey.
HOWARD: Hello.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,348
If any of you are looking for something
to do on Valentine's Day,

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,438
Amy and I'll be streaming our first ever
live episode of Fun with Flags.

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,473
You're welcome to join us
as we celebrate the timeless love affair

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,875
between wind and flapping fabric.

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,396
Penny and l have dinner reservations
that night, but any other time, no.

8
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:27,352
Sorry, Bernie and l are breaking in
the new hot tub, if you know what I mean.

9
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:29,117
Not a clue. Raj?

10
00:00:29,999 --> 00:00:31,990
I'm spending Valentine's Day with Emily.

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,837
You don't sound very excited about it.

12
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:38,998
lam. lam. I guess I'm still wondering
if Emily and l are right for each other.

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,114
Does this have to do with that girl
you had coffee with?

14
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,149
You mean the strong, sexy angel
I can't stop thinking about? Who can say?

15
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,994
You've been talking about
breaking up with Emily forever,

16
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,474
why don't you just do it already?

17
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:52,714
Just get it over with.

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,035
Well, you say it like it's easy.

19
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,707
Have any one of you
ever broken up with anyone?

20
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:02,592
-No.
-Not really.

21
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:06,549
You know, once I ordered
an Uber by accident.

22
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,478
ljust got in and went somewhere.

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,434
(THEME SONG PLAYING)

24
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,432
So, you're really gonna break up with her?

25
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,794
Yeah, I think so. Do you have any advice?

26
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,475
Well, l have broken up with
my fair share of guys.

27
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,238
I mean, how many times
did I break up with Leonard?

28
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,031
I stopped counting at four.

29
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,831
Great. My advice to you is do it at her
place so you can leave when you need to.

30
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:55,349
Tell the truth, make it quick,
and be prepared for tears.

31
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,075
Oh, I'm gonna do a pre-cry before I go
in there, really dry myself out.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,753
-She meant Emily.
-No, I really didn't.

33
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:09,077
-You're seriously breaking up with me?
-Yeah.

34
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:12,356
And you thought right before
Valentine's Day was a good time to do it?

35
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,554
You're right, let's talk again
in a few days.

36
00:02:17,559 --> 00:02:20,198
Hey, Claire. Hi, it's Rajesh.

37
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,914
l was wondering if
you're free for Valentine's Day?

38
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,277
Sorry, ljust got back with my boyfriend.

39
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,232
But ljust broke up with my girlfriend.

40
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:30,027
Right before Valentine's Day?
(SCOFFS) What an ass.

41
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,716
Please take me back!
Our love was meant to be--

42
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,439
(SOBBING) I'm gonna be all alone
on Valentine's Day!

43
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,438
Hmm, you were right, tears.

44
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:47,832
Okay. And we are live in 22 minutes.

45
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:52,717
l'm nervous. I hope people will be around
to watch even though it's Valentine's Day.

46
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,194
People who are fans of an Internet show
about flags? Trust me, they're around.

47
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,876
Oh, and speaking of Valentine's Day,
I haven't forgotten about you tonight.

48
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,513
What do you mean?

49
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,031
Well, you've become such an integral part
of my life as well as this show,

50
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:10,037
I felt it only right to include
your name in the title.

51
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:11,474
(CHUCKLES)

52
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,788
That is so sweet.

53
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,798
So, from now on, this program
will officially be known as

54
00:03:16,999 --> 00:03:20,514
Dr. Sheldon Cooper and
Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present...

55
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,717
(SHELDON READING)

56
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,154
Catchy.

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,116
I'm gonna check the temp on the tub.

58
00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:36,474
Don't make it too hot.

59
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,990
Sorry, but too hot is
the only temperature I come in.

60
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,070
Look at that. You shaved it all.

61
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:52,072
You're welcome.

62
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:56,639
Um, question. This is my first hot tub,

63
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,752
is it supposed to come with
a rat flopping around in it?

64
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:03,229
Ew, really? Get it out!

65
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,588
H ow?

66
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,268
lwish we had a skimmer.

67
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,592
Well, you turn off the jets,
I'll get a strainer from the kitchen.

68
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,913
I don't know how to turn off the jets!

69
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,668
Good, I don't know where
you keep the strainer!

70
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,354
Excuse me.

71
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,999
Bad news, the maitre d' said
it's gonna be at least an hour.

72
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,032
An hour? What?
That's crazy, we have a reservation.

73
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,992
-I know.
-So, what did you say?

74
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,079
Thanks, sorry to bother you.

75
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,317
But I said it like a badass.

76
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:35,915
All right, well, can't you like
slip him some money or somethin'?

77
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,951
Really? I've never done that before.
Does it work?

78
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,549
Do people like money?
Is that what you're asking?

79
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,710
A lot of attitude from the woman
who thought MC-squared was a rapper.

80
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,913
Now is that a smart thing
to say on a holiday

81
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,031
that's basically national sex night?

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,718
I'm sorry. You're pretty. I'm stupid.

83
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,194
Hello. Just checking again for Hofstadter.
Still gonna be an hour?

84
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,036
-l'm afraid so.
-Okay, thanks.

85
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,914
H ey,

86
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:09,516
I think you may have dropped this?

87
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,195
Oh.

88
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:12,514
Anybody lose a 20?

89
00:05:12,799 --> 00:05:13,788
ldid.

90
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,793
Oh, I took care of it.

91
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:32,991
Okay, we are live in five, four, three--

92
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,838
Oh, wait, oh, shoot, I already pushed
the button, never mind, we're live.

93
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:41,630
Hello, and welcome to a special
live edition of Dr. Sheldon Cooper...

94
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:44,074
And Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present...

95
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,910
-Dr. Sheldon Cooper's Fun with Flags!
-Dr. Sheldon Cooper's Fun with Flags!

96
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:53,150
Consider tonight's episode a
Valentine's Day gift for you, our viewers.

97
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:56,198
It's also my gift to you.

98
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,834
That was clear, right?
'Cause you're not getting anything else.

99
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:03,512
Since we're live, you'll finally
be able to reach out to us

100
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,309
with your flag thoughts
and flag questions.

101
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,673
Allow us to answer a few quick ones
that we get all the time.

102
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:14,636
Yes, I really am a doctor.
Yes, she really is my girlfriend.

103
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,350
And no, ljust blink a lot,
it's not Morse code for "rescue me."

104
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:26,238
(COMPUTER CALL RINGING)

105
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,677
Oh, uh, uh...

106
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,233
Here's our first call.

107
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,991
Hello and welcome to Fun with Flags,
what's your question?

108
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:38,352
RAJ: What is wrong with me,
why am I so self-destructive?

109
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,359
-Rajesh?
-Yes!

110
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,599
Whenever things are going well,
| always find a way to ruin it.

111
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,671
You two look happy. How do you do it?

112
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,439
I think it starts with
good communication--

113
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,437
You know what?
That's not a flag question, next caller.

114
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,878
I hope you don't think I'm just saying
this because it's Valentine's Day,

115
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,919
but I love you so much.

116
00:07:02,119 --> 00:07:04,314
I'm gonna put this down your robe.

117
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,150
It's not moving
but I think it's still alive.

118
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,239
Well, should we put it back
in there a few minutes?

119
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,634
No!

120
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,479
And it's not a rat, it's a rabbit.

121
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,317
-We need to save it.
-Well, how do we do that?

122
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:24,756
I don't know, look it up on your phone.
I'm gonna wrap it in a towel.

123
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:29,829
"Taking care of injured rabbit." Okay.

124
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,470
"Make sure it's comfortable and warm."

125
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:34,990
He was just in a hot tub,
I'm gonna say check.

126
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,629
Anything else?

127
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:39,989
"To make sure it's not dehydrated,
feed him an electrolyte solution.

128
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,113
"If it's not responding, use a warm cloth
to wash its face and genitals."

129
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,315
Yeah.

130
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,557
This is ridiculous. You know what,
I'm gonna talk to the maitre d'.

131
00:07:55,119 --> 00:07:58,191
-What're you gonna say?
-I don't know. I'm gonna flirt with him.

132
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,519
I don't know if I'm comfortable with that.

133
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,273
I'm still sleeping with you tonight.

134
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:05,075
See if you can get a table by the window.

135
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,628
-Hi, there. What's your name?
-Glenn.

136
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:14,876
Oh, boy, it is crazy
in here tonight, huh, Glenn?

137
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:16,990
Well, you know, Valentine's Day.

138
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,272
Yes, ugh, I bet your girlfriend is
super bummed you had to work tonight.

139
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:24,391
Anyway, look, we have been
waiting awhile, and ljust feel--

140
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,717
With all due respect, ma'am,
there's nothing I can do.

141
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:30,190
(CHUCKLES) You don't have to
call me ma'am.

142
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,274
-Okay.
-I mean, we're basically the same age.

143
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,749
(LAUGHS) Okay.

144
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,549
How old are you?

145
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:42,317
I'm 21, how old are you?

146
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,073
Just shut up, Glenn.

147
00:08:45,999 --> 00:08:47,114
Come on. Let's get out of here.

148
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:49,355
-What, why?
-Because I'm young, let's go!

149
00:08:52,439 --> 00:08:56,318
Rajesh, it's perfectly normal to have
doubts after breaking up with someone.

150
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,989
RAJ: You really think so?

151
00:08:58,199 --> 00:08:59,791
You know what's not normal?

152
00:08:59,999 --> 00:09:02,911
Blubbering about emotions
during a flag show.

153
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,752
Unless that emotion is excitement over
New Zealand changing their flag.

154
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,394
And good luck you crazy Kiwis,
we're rooting for you.

155
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,599
Yourfriend is hurting.

156
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:18,555
No, Sheldon's right. Emily did say
| always talk about my feelings too much.

157
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,388
Why, I suppose that could be
a legitimate concern in a relationship.

158
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:27,713
Perhaps even a red flag,
and speaking of red flags,

159
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:31,153
check out this sexy number
from the former Soviet Union.

160
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:32,428
Hubba, hubba.

161
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:35,908
-(COMPUTER CALL RINGING)
-Oh, uh...

162
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,477
We have another caller.
Hi, you're on Fun with Flags.

163
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,951
BARRY: Hello, I wanna talk about
how Ioner I am, too.

164
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,913
Kripke, is that you?

165
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,633
Yeah, I'm just sittin' here

166
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:53,315
all by myself wondering if I'll ever
find someone to share my life with.

167
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,870
Preferably Asian, 18 to 24, no fatties.

168
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,119
Please, all comments and questions
should be flag related.

169
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,353
BARRY: All right.
Is my poIe flag related?

170
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:14,716
I don't see why not.

171
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,836
He's eating, that's a good sign.

172
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,510
You're gonna have to wait one hour
until you can go swimming again.

173
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,836
-He's pretty cute.
-He is.

174
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,557
Should we name him?

175
00:10:34,439 --> 00:10:37,476
It is Valentine's Day.
How about Valentino?

176
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,839
Nice. A classic rabbit name.

177
00:10:43,479 --> 00:10:46,198
Peter Rabbit, Roger Rabbit,
Valentino Wolowitz Rabbit.

178
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,759
Look at all that chest hair and overbite,
of course you're a Wolowitz.

179
00:10:55,199 --> 00:10:57,155
Son of a bitch, he bit me!

180
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,596
-Are you okay?
-No. I'm not okay.

181
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,791
Wild rabbits can have rabies.

182
00:11:01,999 --> 00:11:04,467
Oh. Well, why'd you put your finger
near its mouth?

183
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:06,317
Poorjudgment, obviously!

184
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:10,118
He's so little, I'm sure it's fine.

185
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:13,789
How can it be fine? ljust got attacked
by a clearly anti-Semitic wild animal.

186
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:20,029
It's not what we planned,
but this isn't so bad, right?

187
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,231
(MUFFLED) It is freakin' amazing.

188
00:11:24,239 --> 00:11:25,672
Well, I'm glad you're feeling better.

189
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:27,710
lwasjust hungry and cranky.

190
00:11:28,199 --> 00:11:30,076
And I've never been called ma'am before.

191
00:11:30,999 --> 00:11:32,717
-Is that a big deal?
-Kind of.

192
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:34,671
When's the first time
someone's called you sir?

193
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,596
Sixth grade. But I wore a sport coat
and carried a brief case so...

194
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:43,148
Can you believe when I met you l was 22?

195
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,033
I mean, it's crazy.
Where did all that time go?

196
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:49,279
Hmm, you watched The Bachelora lot.

197
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:53,192
Yeah, go ahead and makejokes.
But your 30s are almost over.

198
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:54,354
No, they're not.

199
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,596
You're closer to 40 than you are to 30.

200
00:11:57,079 --> 00:11:59,798
(LAUGHS) You married an old man.

201
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,316
Tell you what,
let's do something fun tonight.

202
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:05,028
It won't make us any younger.

203
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,595
Well, maybe not,
but someday we actually will be old

204
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:10,791
and we'll look back on this night and
remember what a good time we had.

205
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,233
Okay, like what?

206
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:16,029
I know, food fight!

207
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,758
I'll keep thinking.

208
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:28,712
Look, I know you both
feel bad about being alone,

209
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,798
but sometimes the best thing you can do
is take a little time for yourself,

210
00:12:31,999 --> 00:12:34,274
especially when you
just got out of a relationship.

211
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:39,639
And speaking of ending relationships,
when British Honduras became Belize,

212
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,673
they designed a new flag
with a tree on it.

213
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:46,632
And lwould like
to hang myself from that tree.

214
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,435
But Amy, when you and Sheldon split up

215
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,277
didn't you start dating
someone right away?

216
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:59,116
Well, I wouldn't say right away.

217
00:12:59,319 --> 00:13:01,435
And actually, it was three different men.

218
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,875
BARRY: Three different men?
Damn, girl, way to give the milk away!

219
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,755
Aw, looks like we just lost Kripke.

220
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,512
BARRY: No, actually, I'm still here.

221
00:13:14,199 --> 00:13:15,871
-N ow?
- Yep.

222
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,354
-N ow?
- Yep.

223
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,595
N ow?

224
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,039
Aw, looks like we just lost Kripke.

225
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,274
Before Emily, l was alone for so long.

226
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,959
I don't know if I can do that again.

227
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,390
Well, you know, here is something
that might cheer you up.

228
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,910
The flag of the Isle of Man is nothing but

229
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,588
three legs sharing
a weird pair of underpants.

230
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,439
So, you think you got problems...

231
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,712
l have an idea.

232
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,155
Maybe someone in our audience
would be interested in meeting Rajesh.

233
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,670
Ladies, I can attest that he is a kind,
handsome, intelligent--

234
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,917
RAJ: Rich parents,
don't forget rich parents!

235
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,199
-Spoiled astrophysicist, who not only--
-(COMPUTER CALL RINGING)

236
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,118
Oh, well, that was quick.

237
00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:03,316
Hi, you're on Fun with Flags.

238
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,556
BARRY: Hey, I think Igot cut off.

239
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:09,308
Hello, Kripke.

240
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,998
BARRY: I have a flag question.

241
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:13,237
How many men did you have sex with?

242
00:14:16,719 --> 00:14:20,917
Let's see, what's young and fun?
Uh, we could go dancing.

243
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,349
Are you actually gonna dance?

244
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,596
-Well, of course.
-Yeah, no one wants to see that.

245
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,871
Hey, how about skinny-dipping
at the beach?

246
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,037
No, I don't need any fish
nibbling my business.

247
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:35,837
Oh, there's a screening of Moulin Rouge.
I heard the crowd sings along and stuff.

248
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,519
That sounds fun. When's it start?

249
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,948
Midnight.

250
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,793
Midnight, really?

251
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,152
You know what? Let's do it.

252
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,713
Okay, great!

253
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,751
Oh, wait, uh, it's sold out.

254
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:49,711
-Oh, thank God!
-Yes!

255
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,473
It says rabies in rabbits
is highly unlikely.

256
00:14:54,679 --> 00:14:55,794
Terrific!

257
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,070
It's not terrific.
Lots of highly unlikely things happen.

258
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,271
You saw what's under this robe
and you still married me.

259
00:15:02,319 --> 00:15:04,469
If you're really worried, we'll take him
to a vet and have him tested.

260
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,638
Good, thank you. Okay, there is a test.

261
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,674
All they have to do is cut off his head
and check his brain.

262
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:15,315
Oh, cut off his head?
That's where his little nose is.

263
00:15:17,439 --> 00:15:20,112
He's not showing any symptoms.

264
00:15:20,439 --> 00:15:23,511
Okay, I guess, I'll just go to
the emergency room to be safe.

265
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:26,157
Howie, this is just your hypochondria.

266
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,476
When I sat on the mute button
and thought I'd gone deaf,

267
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,352
that was my hypochondria.

268
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:41,154
We'll find another time
to tell him I'm pregnant.

269
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,669
RAJ: I mean, this is the ﬁrst time
I've ever broken up with someone.

270
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:54,313
ljust... I didn't realize it was
gonna hur't just this much.

271
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:55,952
It really can.

272
00:15:56,439 --> 00:15:57,554
All right.

273
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:02,029
Nothing about this is fun.

274
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,314
And no one wants to talk about flags.

275
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,080
But I haven't spoken in over 10 minutes.

276
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:11,876
So, enjoy your new show, lnternet.

277
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,469
(SHELDON READING)

278
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:21,674
RAJ: I'm sorry for bothering you.
I'll hang up now.

279
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:23,107
Hold on, Rajesh.

280
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:24,991
You know, you're not being
very sympathetic.

281
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,110
You know firsthand that breakups are hard.

282
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,270
Fine. If you insist on making me
a part of this, yes,

283
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,357
I acknowledge how painful they can be.

284
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:39,232
However, pain has an evolutionary purpose.

285
00:16:39,439 --> 00:16:41,509
It provides information
from the environment

286
00:16:41,719 --> 00:16:44,517
that a behavior isn't good for us.

287
00:16:44,719 --> 00:16:47,791
BARRY: Like when I fell in love with
that stripper and bought her a Prius.

288
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:52,676
I'm just gonna push all the buttons.

289
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:57,433
Raj, now, I'm sorry you're suffering.

290
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,313
When Amy and l were broken up,
I also suffered.

291
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,193
And this may sound surprising,

292
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,550
but I'm grateful
for having gone through it.

293
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:07,348
Really?

294
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,155
Yes.

295
00:17:09,719 --> 00:17:12,438
I believe our relationship now
is stronger than ever.

296
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:15,308
So do I.

297
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,428
When we were apart,
I learned how important you are to me.

298
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,110
And I realized that when two people
are in love, sometimes they--

299
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,117
Happy Valentine's Day!

300
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,795
(HORN BLOWING)

301
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:31,116
We are young and fun!

302
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,829
(HORN CONTINUES BLOWING)

303
00:17:36,439 --> 00:17:38,157
I stand corrected.

304
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:49,591
Congratulations on a successful live show.

305
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,751
And a lovely Valentine's Day.

306
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,269
Cleaning up is not young and fun.

307
00:17:58,359 --> 00:17:59,951
It can be. Confetti fight!

308
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:08,190
Maybe you should take a break. I got this.

309
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:15,834
Did you know the singular
of confetti is confetto?

310
00:18:16,999 --> 00:18:19,467
Interesting, and when
would you use the singular?

311
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:22,831
I'm glad you asked.
Amy, you have a confetto in your nose.

312
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:27,032
No, no, no, other side. There you go.
