Look at all that chest hair and over bite.
Of course you're a Wolowitz.

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,631
Son of a bitch, he bit me!

4
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:16,270
I guess I'll just go
to the emergency room to be safe.

5
00:00:16,919 --> 00:00:18,557
Howie, this is just your hypochondria.

6
00:00:18,759 --> 00:00:21,068
When I sat on the mute button
and thought I'd gone deaf,

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,713
that was my hypochondria.

8
00:00:31,479 --> 00:00:33,868
We'll find another time
to tell him I'm pregnant.

9
00:00:39,199 --> 00:00:40,632
-Morning.
-Morning.

10
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:43,754
"We?" What is this?

11
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:46,394
I don't know.
Maybe it says something on the back.

12
00:00:48,319 --> 00:00:50,071
"Continued on milk."

13
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,552
If you're tricking me
into making my own breakfast,

14
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,671
it didn't work for my mom
and it won't work for you.

15
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,837
"Are." "We are..."

16
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,716
"See spoons for more."
(DRY CHUCKLE)

17
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,594
What could it be? "We are Groot"?

18
00:01:05,839 --> 00:01:10,390
"We are the champions"? "We are family.
I got all my sisters with me"?

19
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,069
Are you serious?

20
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,195
Yeah.

21
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,472
Are you sure?

22
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,034
Yeah. Pretty positive.

23
00:01:24,839 --> 00:01:26,511
That's ajoke,
because the pregnancy test says that--

24
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,039
Oh, my God!

25
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,754
This is incredible.
We're gonna be parents.

26
00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:37,832
We're gonna get to board planes first!

27
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:43,236
Finally gonna get to see what's
in that "family" bathroom at the mall.

Oh!

31
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:52,994
I mean, how do you prepare
for something like this?

32
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,993
I'm not even sure I've held a baby before.

33
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,519
Oh, it's okay, you'll figure it out.

34
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:00,517
But how's this all gonna work?
Do we get a nanny?

35
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,869
And can we afford a nanny?

36
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:04,838
If we can, we can't get a pretty one
'cause it'll wreck our marriage.

37
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:08,829
We can't get an ugly one
'cause it'll scare the kid.

38
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,109
-I don't know, Howie.
-Are we in a good school district?

39
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,630
You're Catholic, I'm Jewish!
What religion do we raise it?

40
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,512
And if it's a boy,
do we get him circumcised?

41
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,996
People say it's barbaric, but if we don't
it looks like a pig in a blanket.

How's it gonna be okay?

45
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:32,669
Look at me. I'm a mess.

46
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,871
And that means
this baby's gonna be half a mess

47
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,229
and that's even before we screw it up

48
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,556

Hey Raj, I read
a couple guys in your department

51
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,235
may have discovered
a new planet in our solar system?

52
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,954
Oh, I heard about that.
Why didn't you discover it?

53
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,712
Because instead of being
in the telescope room,

54
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,992
I was busy making you guys
homemade jam for the holidays.

to tell you guys something.

you got in December,

Why "oh, no"?

68
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,518
Because this changes everything.

What about comic book night?

70
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,277
What about playing games together?
What about our trips to Disneyland?

How can we do those things
with a child around?

You're the other baby.

Oh, really? Okay. We”, would a baby
have to shave once every 11 days?

I am. Of course I am.

I'm sure it's just the hormones.

But it's weird.

93
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:01,674
Howie's the one who's been talking
about having kids for years

94
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,355
and I was all excited to tell him
because I thought he'd be thrilled,

95
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,358
but then he started to flip out
and now this feels like a bad idea,

96
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:09,151
and I'm gonna get fat.

97
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,990
No! No, come on. Come on,
you're not gonna get fat,

98
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:15,953
you're gonna be beautiful and glowing,
and have the cutest little baby bump ever.

99
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,116
Easy for you to say, skinny bitch.

100
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:21,718
Sorry, hormones.

101
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,672
Oh, that's all right.
All I heard was skinny.

102
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,511

out of Howard not reacting

103
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,948
the way you expected him to.

104
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,116
Yeah, I'm sure
it was just the initial shock of it all.

105
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:33,108
You're probably right.

106
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:35,514

he started to calm down.

107
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:39,394

what if she looks like me?

Not to mention
the impact on our social circle.

Everything's going to change.
Howard won't be able to come over as much.

114
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,069
Well, he could bring the baby here.

115
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,191
Then we'd have to baby-proof
the apartment.

how expensive having a kid is?

Yeah, I read that in Los Angeles,
raising a child through college

120
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:18,838
can cost over a million dollars.

and you know it.

and hang out in the hot tub.

Doctor said I can't go in the hot tub.

144
00:07:27,359 --> 00:07:28,872

00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:38,752

to our friend Howard.

His big heart, his beautiful soul--

148

And his tight little pants
that somehow did not make him sterile.

Now I bet whoever invented tiny umbrellas
doesn't have to worry about money.

He can have all the kids he wants.

153

of their heads dry.

with your superfluid helium model.

all Apple does
is change the size of things

170
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:56,747
and we keep buying them.

171
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:01,196
It's true, I like my giant iPad
and my little iPad

172
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:03,594
almost as much as my regular-sized iPad.

173
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:06,987
This place is terrific.

174
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:09,030
Why have we never been here before?

175
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,314
Same reason we don't do
a lot of fun stuff. You.

176
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,516
That's some smart talk from a guy
who can't even keep his face in focus.

177
00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:23,230
-Where's the bathroom?
-It's in the corner.

178
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:24,713
Excuse me.

179
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,754
Hey, how you doing?

180
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,878
I hope the bathroom is clearly marked.

181
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:36,195
Doesn't matter,
he's headed for the kitchen anyway.

182
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,837
Maybe that's an idea.
Guidance systems for drunk people.

183
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,792
They have that, it's called Uber.

184
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,435
Hey, in your super-cooled
helium experiments,

185
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:48,630
did you create quantum vortices?

186
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,876
-Yeah, why?
-Well, if you made a guidance system,

187
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,270
couldn't you use those vortices
as a gyroscope?

188
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:55,597
Wow, never thought about that.

189
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,997
And since it's in a quantum state,
it would maintain an infinite persistence.

190
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:01,713
Groundbreaking revelations,
tropical drinks, tell me

191
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,559
this isn't like the best episode
of Sex and the City.

192
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,792
You may have actually
just come up with something.

193
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,274
-You think so?
-Yeah, I really do.

194
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,074
You guys, the bathroom here is amazing.

195
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,998
There's people cooking in it.

196
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:21,954
Think about all the fun things
you get to do when you have a baby.

197
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,391
Yeah, yeah, you get to buy toys
and little clothes.

198
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:27,470
I kind of already do that for Howie.

199
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,189
And, whenever you're hungry,

200
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,710
you'll be in a minivan
with Cheerios all over the floor.

201
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,831
Oh, and Ijust found a new travel cup
for Sheldon.

202
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,519
It only lets out three at a time.

203
00:10:40,199 --> 00:10:42,474
So, when did you guys decide
to get pregnant?

204
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:45,228
Well, we didn't exactly decide.

205
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,711
We were talking about it, and then
one night we got a little reckless.

206
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:50,238
-Oh, tell us!
-Yeah, yeah, tell us.

207
00:10:50,439 --> 00:10:51,394
No, I'm embarrassed.

208
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,192
Come on, we're all grown-ups.
We've all done it.

209
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,310
Me! Me, too. I'm a grown-up
and I've done it!

210
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:00,954
Fine.

211
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,994
We were out one night
and things got a little spontaneous.

212
00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:06,678
Well, that sounds juicy.

213
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:10,754
WeII, Sheldon was going on and on
about time zones and railroad schedules,

214
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,599
-and I went out--
-Wait, I remember that. Hang on,

215
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:16,591
you did it at our place?

216
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:20,397
Kind of on Sheldon's bed.

217
00:11:20,599 --> 00:11:22,191
-What?
-No!

218
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,270
I was headed to the bathroom
and I passed Howie on his way out.

219
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,189
Usually he says, "Do not go in there,"

220
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:35,157
but this time he said,
"Hey, let's go in here."

221
00:11:36,439 --> 00:11:38,350
-How could you do that?
-I'm sorry,

222
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,278
but you know what it's like
when you're with your man

223
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,708
and one thing leads to another.

224
00:11:42,199 --> 00:11:43,871
I do know what that's like, I really do.

225
00:11:47,439 --> 00:11:50,351
I'm not seeing anyone
using liquid helium vortices like this.

226
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,959
I'm not finding anything either.

227
00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:53,234
That's a good sign.

228
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,032
Oh, wait, I found something.

229
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,348
Damn, what is it?

230
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,236
This video, the baby panda sneezes
and the momma panda gets so scared.

231
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,350
Can we focus on what we're talking about?

232
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,314
(SIGHS) All right, look, now,
this may be the rum talking,

233
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:13,789
but as long as the unpinning rate
of the vortices

234
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:16,229
is kept within 1.1 and 1.3,

235
00:12:16,439 --> 00:12:19,078
the Magnus force issue
should be negligible.

236
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,470
Even drunk
he's still smarter than all of us.

237
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:28,596
And stronger. Who wants to see me
beat up the bartender?

238
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:31,914
I'd enjoy that.

239
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,439
Nah, she's a good kid.

240
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,353
I mean, if this is a viable thing,

241
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,109
we could get a patent and license it
to companies that make guidance systems.

242
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,036
Look at that. You've known you're gonna
be a father for less than a day

243
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,913
-and you're already stepping up.
-I'm telling you, you got this.

244
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,155
Maybe you're right.

245
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,509
Of course he's right.

246
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,912
You and I both know how hard it is
growing up without a father.

247
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,157
That's why I'm confident
you're gonna be the best dad you can be.

-You're welcome.
