1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,796
50 Sheldon, there's something
I've been wanting to talk about,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,877
but I know it's kind of a touchy subject.

3
00:00:08,159 --> 00:00:09,911
Way to narrow it down to everything.

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,790
What is it?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,150
Well, your birthday is coming up
and you've never let us celebrate it,

6
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:17,589
and l was hoping maybe this year we could.

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,314
Oh. I suppose
that's a discussion we could have.

8
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:27,187
Okay, great. I mean,

9
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:29,993
it doesn't have to be a big party
or anything. I was just--

10
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,274
Where'd he go?

11
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:36,434
Wait a minute.

12
00:00:36,639 --> 00:00:38,709
You mention his birthday and he vanishes?

13
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:41,998
Well, where has that information been
this whole time?

14
00:00:43,279 --> 00:00:45,235
(THEME SONG PLAYING)

15
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:11,074
Well, where is he?

16
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,110
-Sheldon?
-l'll check his room.

17
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,514
Surprise!

18
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,675
-Oh, my God!
-Why?

19
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,077
Just one example
of how birthdays can be terrible.

20
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:23,636
Now, can we please drop this subject
and pick a new one?

21
00:01:23,839 --> 00:01:27,434
You know, I suggest, "How thick can
a soup get before it becomes a stew?"

22
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,790
You know, that answer,
it may surprise you.

23
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,438
I'm sorry I brought it up.

24
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,631
Yeah, what is the problem?
Is it about getting older?

25
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,956
Please, look at this porcelain skin.

26
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,673
I'm like a human sink.

27
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,630
But it's the one day a year
that's just all about you.

28
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,829
One day. (LAUGHS)

29
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,548
Right.

30
00:01:52,919 --> 00:01:54,716
Can you please just tell me why?

31
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,275
Fine.

32
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:02,272
As you know, I have a twin sister
with whom I obviously share a birthday.

33
00:02:02,679 --> 00:02:04,032
Every year we'd have a party.

34
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,800
No one I invited would ever come
because they didn't like me.

35
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:09,474
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,875
That part wasn't so bad,
I didn't like them either.

37
00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:14,388
But then I'd inevitably spend
the whole day

38
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,989
being tortured by my sister's friends.

39
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:18,758
Aw. Poor thing.

40
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,190
When I was six, they told me
Batman was coming to my party.

41
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,719
I waited by the door for hours.

42
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:26,753
Closest thing to Batman I saw
was when a robin flew into the window.

43
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:31,233
You realize none of those things
would happen now?

44
00:02:31,559 --> 00:02:32,514
I do.

45
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,108
But why do you care
if I celebrate my birthday at all?

46
00:02:35,559 --> 00:02:36,548
Well,

47
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,036
you made my last birthday so memorable,
I wanted to return the favor.

48
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,512
You know, if you had a party now, you have
plenty of friends who would love to come.

49
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,119
And we live here, so we have no choice.

50
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,389
Yeah.

51
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,555
Very well.

52
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,273
You may celebrate my life
by throwing a party

53
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,597
with cake, presents,
and a shower of admiration and love.

54
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,437
But then you owe me big time.

55
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,269
You have any idea what
you're getting Sheldon for his birthday?

56
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,072
He's been fascinated
with dinosaurs lately.

57
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,713
Maybe we could get him a fossil.

58
00:03:06,279 --> 00:03:07,678
Just don't get anything Jurassic.

59
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:10,598
He feels like that whole chunk of time
has gone Hollywood.

60
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:17,833
You know, he told a sad story
about how his sister tricked him

61
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,474
into thinking Batman
was coming to his party.

62
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,308
That's funny, let's do that.

63
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,916
Maybe we could get Batman
to actually show up.

64
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,879
You mean, some guy in a lame suit?

65
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,194
Or a real Batman.

66
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,355
Hey, Stuart,

67
00:03:31,559 --> 00:03:33,914
didn't you try to get Adam West
to do a signing here once?

68
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,315
Yeah, but there was kind of
a scheduling conflict.

69
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,034
He wanted to know when he'd get paid,

70
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,878
and lwouldn't tell him.

71
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:44,352
Can I get his contact info?

72
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:45,469
Sure.

73
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:48,239
But just so you know, he's kind of a diva.

74
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,668
-He is?
-Oh, yeah.

75
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,996
He won't take the bus,
he won't pack his own lunch.

76
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,198
He won't let you spend the night
on his couch.

77
00:03:57,679 --> 00:04:00,113
Okay.
So, how do you feel about party balloons?

78
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,958
Mylar balloons, yes.

79
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,434
Latex balloons, no.

80
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:07,348
Water balloons, I will jump off the roof
and aim for your car.

81
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,873
All right, what about music?

82
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,834
I enjoy marching bands
and Tibetan throat singing.

83
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,715
No music it is.

84
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,428
What kind of cake do you like?

85
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:22,229
Well, my favorite is chocolate
with strawberry frosting, three layers,

86
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,749
and if there's writing on it,
make sure it's not all caps.

87
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,631
I don't need my dessert yelling at me.

88
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,754
Hey, so what was Adam West like
on the phone?

89
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:33,914
Nice guy.

90
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,917
But it was a little weird
to hear Batman say,

91
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,759
"Don't ring the doorbell
or my poodles will go crazy."

92
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,033
You know, Adam West is my favorite Batman.

93
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,959
Well, after Michael Keaton, Christian Bale

94
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,957
and Batman from The Lego Movie.

95
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:50,547
Don't say that to him.

96
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,156
What? He beat out George Clooney,
and that's something.

97
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,237
Like, I love me some Clooney.

98
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,037
Don't say that to anyone.

99
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,831
Thank you so much for helping us, Stuart.

100
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,076
l was just glad to be invited.

101
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,714
To be honest, I don't always feel
like I'm part of the group.

102
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:09,829
Okay, sweetie, we're on the clock here.

103
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:12,473
Can you hate yourself
and frost at the same time?

104
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,718
Hello. Hope I'm not too early.

105
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:16,829
Not at all. Come on in.

106
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,349
And how is the radiant mommy-to-be?

107
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,788
Doing great!

108
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:23,710
-You-- You're pregnant?
-Yeah.

109
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,674
Sounds like something
a member of the group might know.

110
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,755
Yeah.
Birthday party first, pity party later.

111
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,349
Are you crazy?

112
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,075
How can you put Michael Keaton
in front of Christian Bale?

113
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,599
Oh, please.

114
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:46,550
Even my poodles know Bale's overrated.

115
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,470
Thank you!

116
00:05:48,679 --> 00:05:50,192
That's why I say Keaton's number one.

117
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:51,912
He brought a sense of humor to the role.

118
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,759
Well, if you're gonna factor in
a sense of humor,

119
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,915
well, I should be at the top of the list.

120
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,829
It should be me, Keaton, Kilmer,

121
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,757
LEGO, Bale,

122
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,597
and that pretty boy Clooney.

123
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:09,595
Really? You're ahead of Bale?

124
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,031
The man who personified the words,
"I'm Batman"?

125
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,879
I never had to say, "I'm Batman."

126
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,231
I showed up, people knew I was Batman.

127
00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:24,109
Everywhere I went,
on the TV show, mall openings,

128
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,269
Julie Newmar's bungalow.

129
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,910
-l'm sold. You're ahead of Bale.
-(ALL CHUCKLING)

130
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:35,589
There's another reason
I should be higher on the list.

131
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:40,238
All those other guys
had muscles built into their costumes.

132
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:45,832
All I had in my batsuit
was 100% grade A West.

133
00:06:48,679 --> 00:06:50,795
Can we just all agree
we're worried about Affleck?

134
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,797
-Sure.
-Yeah. Of course.

135
00:06:55,119 --> 00:06:56,074
What's an Affleck?

136
00:06:59,399 --> 00:07:01,674
Is there a reason
I had to leave my own apartment?

137
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,877
Well, I think theyjust want you to see it
for the first time all decorated.

138
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:08,272
But who's gonna tell them
they're doing it wrong?

139
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,393
Well, I'm sure they'll ask you
to give a speech,

140
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,989
and that's when
you just tear them a new one.

141
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:18,509
l have to say, you--
You do look good in that suit.

142
00:07:18,719 --> 00:07:19,993
Oh. Thank you.

143
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,236
Maybe later I'll get to see you
in your birthday suit.

144
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:30,196
But this is my birthday suit.

145
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:34,316
Are you having a stroke?

146
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,149
Because that's the kind of thing
that just ruins a birthday party.

147
00:07:41,119 --> 00:07:44,031
So, Mother, I'm surprised you came
all this way for Sheldon's birthday.

148
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,195
l was happy to.

149
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:47,071
He did come to my 60th.

150
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,792
Oh! You had a party for your 60th?

151
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,033
I wouldn't call it a party.

152
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,718
Just a few close friends.

153
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,992
And your sister and brother.

154
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,631
You know, to be fair, we did get married
in Vegas and didn't invite her.

155
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,354
And I never did thank you for that, dear.

156
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:11,032
-(CELL PHONE BEEPS)
-Oh!

157
00:08:11,719 --> 00:08:13,675
Penny says everyone's there.
Are you ready?

158
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,230
(EXHALES)

159
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:16,554
I am.

160
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,715
Oh!

161
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,398
-Wait.
-Are you all right?

162
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,874
No, ljust... I got a little lightheaded.

163
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,478
Oh. Do you need a minute?

164
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:30,794
(EXHALES)

165
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,155
No.

166
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,920
No, if I can walk past that pet shop
with the parrot in the window,

167
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,838
I suppose I can do this.

168
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:44,109
ALL: Happy birthday!

169
00:08:44,439 --> 00:08:45,474

170
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,955
Speech, speech!

171
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,279
Come on, Sheldon. Say something.

172
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,430
Why, thank you all so much for coming.

173
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:56,391
Beverly, Wil Wheaton,

174
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,795
Adam West, for some reason.

175
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,758
Batman finally came to your party.

176
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,349
Happy birthday, Sherman.

177
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:09,914
SHELDON: Thank you.

178
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,077
This is all so thoughtful.

(HEARTBEAT THUMPING)

180
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,469
Excuse me.

181
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,672
I still get paid, don't I?

182
00:09:37,319 --> 00:09:39,275
Okay.
I'd better go in there and talk to him.

183
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,232
Well, don't you think
I'm the one who should go in?

184
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,875
No offense, but I've known the guy
a really long time.

185
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:47,313
Well, I've, you know,
seen him without pants on.

186
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:51,469
Again, no offense, but so have I.

187
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,273
Well, he's seen me without pants on.

188
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:57,107
-Again, no offense--
-Okay, this is ridiculous!

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

190
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,118
PENNY: Sheldon? Can I come in?

191
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,990
How do you know
I'm not using the facilities?

192
00:10:06,199 --> 00:10:08,554
Because you email me
your bathroom schedule once a week

193
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:11,478
even though I've clicked "unsubscribe"
like a thousand times.

194
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:20,718
So, what's going on?

195
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:22,233
I don't know.

196
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:26,398
I looked around the room
and I saw all the faces and the presents,

197
00:10:26,599 --> 00:10:27,793
and it was just too much.

198
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,189
| get that.

199
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,916
Hey, you wannajust bring
a few people in here?

200
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,954
You know, Wil Wheaton in the bathtub,
Batman on the toilet.

201
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:41,070
It'll be like the weirdest Comic-Con ever.

202
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,672
I know that you worked hard
to put this together.

203
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,437
I'm sorry I'm ruining it.

204
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,590
Oh... You're not ruining it.

205
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,439
Look, at some point, Raj will try
to get everyone to do the Electric Slide.

206
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:53,311
Now that will ruin it.

207
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,352
I don't think I can go back out there.

208
00:10:58,759 --> 00:10:59,794
That's fine.

209
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,550
You know, I hate that your sister
and her friends used to torture you.

210
00:11:16,199 --> 00:11:18,554
But what I hate even more is,
if I was there,

211
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:20,351
I would have tortured you, too.

212
00:11:23,199 --> 00:11:25,554
Based on this pep talk,
I'd say you're still doing it.

213
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,277
My point is, there was a time

214
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,152
I never would have been friends
with someone like you,

215
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,193
and now,
you are one of my favorite people.

216
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:38,110
So, if what you need
is to spend your birthday in a bathroom,

217
00:11:38,439 --> 00:11:39,758
I'm happy to do it with you.

218
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:44,591
Well, everyone will think I'm weird.

00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,551
Sweetie, you are weird.

220
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,559
Everyone knows you're weird.

221
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:00,513
But they're all still here
because they care about you so much.

BARRY: Hello?
Some of us need to check our hair

223
00:12:03,439 --> 00:12:06,795

the last time we talked.

So much has changed!

00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:20,388
Has it?

Yeah. Penny and I got married.

you'd be living with Sheldon forever.

Yeah, well...

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,515
Don't be a stranger.

234
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,395
Okay, everybody.

Sheldon is gonna come back out,

236
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,513
but I think he's a little embarrassed,
so let's all be extra nice, okay?

I'm a saint. (LAUGHS)

a damper on the party.

for the birthday boy to receive presents,

250
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:19,269
but I feel like I got the greatest gift
the day he was born.

-Hear, hear. Yes.

and call you my friend.

Sheldon, I know that we have had
our ups and downs,

but I can honestly say

265
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:57,548
that my life is so much more interesting
because you are in it.

266
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:00,874
We may have met
because you are a fan of Star Trek,

267

but I have become a fan of Sheldon Cooper.

you weren't in my life.

Happy birthday, dear Sheldon

329
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,356
Uh, Professor Hawking,
if you just give us one second,

330
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,790
we'll light the candles
and we could all sing together.

331
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,869
I was crushing it, but all right.

332
00:16:44,439 --> 00:16:46,794
Okay. While they get the cake,
Sheldon, I just wanna say,

333

I hope you didn't think you were
gonna get through tonight without a hug.
