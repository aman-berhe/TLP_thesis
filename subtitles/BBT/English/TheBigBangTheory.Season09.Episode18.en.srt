00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,679
PENNY: Previously on
The Big Bang Theory...

2
00:00:04,199 --> 00:00:06,633
I guess I'm still wondering
if Emily and I are right for each other.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,589
Does this have to do with that girl
you had coffee with?

4
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:13,355
You mean the strong, sexy angel
I can't stop thinking about? Who can say?

5
00:00:15,319 --> 00:00:17,674
I need to come up with a big idea
to make some money.

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,950
-There's no reason you can't.
-That's easy for you to say.

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,310
You and Sheldon already came up
with your supen‘luid helium model.

8
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:24,987
That's just research,
we're never gonna make any money from it.

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,714
Forget helium. The real supen‘luid
is the fruit punch in this mug.

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,112
Reminds me of my daddy's
secret don't-tell-mamajuice.

11
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:38,556
Maybe that's an idea.
Guidance systems for drunk people.

12
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:40,556
They have that, it's called Uber.

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,274
Hey, in your super-cooled
helium experiments,

14
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:46,390
did you create quantum vortices?

15
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,591
-Yeah, Why?
-Well, if you made a guidance system,

16
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,029
couldn't you use those vortices
as a gyroscope?

17
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:53,394
Never thought about that.

18
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,672
And since it's in a quantum state,
it would maintain an infinite persistence.

19
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,519
Groundbreaking revelations,
tropical drinks, tell me

20
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,553
this isn't like the best episode
of Sex and the City.

21
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,277
Okay, I gotta ask.
Why are you wearing a bow tie?

22
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:14,835
Well, I've never applied
for a patent before.

23
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:16,757
I wanted to make a good impression.

24
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:20,109
Is the impression
that your first name is Pee-wee?

25
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,275
(CHUCKLES)

26
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,395
Yeah, well, you're an engineer.
End ofjoke, burn.

27
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:33,198
Come on in, fellas.

28
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:34,832
See, he's not wearing a tie.

29
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:36,995
Well, he's a patent attorney,
maybe his tie is pending.

30
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:41,070
So, I've reviewed your paperwork.

31
00:01:41,279 --> 00:01:43,110
It seems like we've got everything we need

32
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,959
to file a patent
for your infinite persistence gyroscope.

33
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,387
-That's great!
-Exce||ent.

34
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:48,554
So what happens next?

35
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:51,353
Well, the legal team needs to review
existing patents to avoid overlap.

36
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,959
Oh, I don't think there will be.

37
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,639
Yes, we did our own search, so...

38
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,753
That's nice, but I think ours
might be a bit more thorough.

39
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,752
(CHUCKLES) Get a load of this guy.

40
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,512
Can you imagine
if we make money with this?

41
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:07,553
Well, if we do, I am splurging
on the best sinus irrigator money can buy.

42
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,758
That old sad story, guy gets
a little money,

43
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,187
-goes straight up his nose.
-(CHUCKLES)

44
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:16,631
Just need you to review
and sign this document

45
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,231
acknowledging that you understand
the university will own 75% of the patent.

46
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,631
Seventy-five percent?

47
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,829
That's outrageous.

48
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,429
I mean, this is our idea
based on our research.

49
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,552
How can you possiblyjustify
owning a majority share?

50
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,034
It's university policy.

51
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,233
I know when I'm beat.

52
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:38,877
Hold on, hold on.
So the three of us do all the work

53
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,752
and only end up with 25%?

54
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,949
Dr. Hofstadter, this university's been
paying your salaries for over ten years.

55
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:47,150
Do you think we do that
out of the goodness of our hearts?

56
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:50,631
Well, until you just said
that mean thing, kind of.

57
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,270
And as far as Mr. Wolowitz is concerned,

58
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,119
I'm afraid as a federal employee
on loan from NASA,

59
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:59,150
your name can be on the patent, but...

60
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:01,915
You're not entitled to an ownership share.

61
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:06,911
Wait, so this can turn out to be
a financial success and | get nothing?

62
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:10,717
Well, sometimes they give you a plaque.

63
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,992
Well, that's not fair.
We should all get plaques.

64
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,398
Sorry, but we can't sign this.

65
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,952
Come on, let's go.

66
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,638
Thank you for your time.

67
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,631
A couple of questions about the plaque--

68
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:30,430
(THEME SONG PLAYS)

69
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,509
So, have you been having
any morning sickness?

70
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:58,956
A little, and it doesn't help that I have
this heightened sense of smell.

71
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,478
What, is that a pregnancy thing?

72
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,275
Yeah. The other day | sniffed out
where Howie hid the Girl Scout Cookies.

73
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,431
No more Tagalongs, my ass.

74
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:13,431
But now you'll be able to make
your own milk to eat the cookies with.

75
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,513
Hey, guys. Hey, Penny,

76
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,598
I really appreciate you helping me
with this. I don't know what to do.

77
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,392
-Sure, let me see it.
-See what?

78
00:04:22,599 --> 00:04:24,510
I hadn't spoken to Emily
since I broke up with her,

79
00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:26,471
and she left this
on my doorstep with a note.

80
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,272
"Raj, I got you this before we split up
but couldn't return it

81
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,789
"and thought you'd like to have it.
Happy belated Valentine's Day, Emily."

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,149
That's nice.

83
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:36,872
"Nice," or is she trying
to manipulate him?

84
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,230
I know. I mean, do | open it?
Do | return it?

85
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,509
Why wouldn't you open it?

86
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,314
Well, she was pretty mad,
for all I know it's a voodoo doll of me

87
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,192
with afork stuck in myjunk.

88
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,068
You don't think she'd actually send you
something gross or dangerous, do you?

89
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,350
I know one way to find out. Sniff this.

90
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,711
She's pregnant, she's not a bloodhound.

91
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,193
Although I am getting
a little machine oil, I think it's metal.

92
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:03,188
Come on, just open it.

93
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:05,753
You know, on Game of Thrones

94
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,872
Balon Greyjoy received
his son's genitals in a box.

95
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,919
Oh, never hurts to have a spare.

-BERNADETTE: What is that?
-Wow!

98
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:19,554
It's an antique sextant.

99
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,512
Sailors used these
to find their positions by the stars.

100
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,751
What a nice gift for an astrophysicist.

101
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,995
I know, she's so thoughtful.

102
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,632
See, she's trying to get you back.

103
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,159
Now that is exactly
what I would've gotten you

104
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,271
if I had any idea
what it is or what you do.

105
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,549
You know, I...

106
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:35,874
I have too much self-esteem

107
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,469
to let this girl guilt me
into getting back together with her.

108
00:05:39,359 --> 00:05:41,668
You don't need to be pregnant
to smell that load of crap.

109
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:45,714
(SIGHS)

110
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,955
Well...

111
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,549
What if we go around the university
and just get the patent ourselves?

112
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,829
We can't. It says on their website
as long as we work there,

113
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:54,314
they have a controlling ownership
of anything we come up with.

114
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,199
Great. So they own my idea for a T-shirt
that says "Dumb as a Bag of Geologists."

115
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:05,795
Well, our choices are
we do this with the university

116
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,910
or we don't do it at all.

117
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,031
Either way, I get nothing.

118
00:06:09,559 --> 00:06:12,198
Or if we end up making money from this,

119
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,549
Sheldon and I could
split our shares with you.

120
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,790
To be clear,
Leonard's referring to the gyroscope,

121
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,513
not the T-shirt and mugs.

122
00:06:20,239 --> 00:06:21,194
Oh!

123
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,549
Now they own the mugs.

124
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,232
I guess that is a way around this.
You guys would be cool doing it like that?

125
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:30,430
Of course,
we would split any profits three ways.

126
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,789
-l'm fine with that.
-Okay, great.

127
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,550
It sounds like a contract
might be in order.

128
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,318
Sure, we could write something up.

129
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:43,271
But which one of us
should be the party who--

130
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,390
You can do it, Sheldon.

131
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,715
So stipulated!

132
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:51,715
Once I found a stash of contracts
under his bed, it was weird.

133
00:06:56,719 --> 00:06:58,118
I wonder how much she spent on this.

134
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,594
Ooh! Let's find out.

135
00:07:00,679 --> 00:07:02,749
It doesn't matter,
it's the thought that counts.

136
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,191
Yeah, yeah, and beauty's on the inside,
size doesn't matter. How much she spend?

137
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,431
Seriously, guys, I don't wanna know.

138
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:10,788
Oh, my.

139
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,668
Well, come on, you can't say,
"Oh, my" and then not tell me!

140
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,189
These things go for $500 and up.

141
00:07:17,799 --> 00:07:20,393
Damn. All I got for Valentine's Day
was a postcard saying

142
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,477
my Vermont Teddy Bear was back-ordered.

143
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,231
Okay, so she drops off a $500 gift

144
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,998
and she's not trying
to get back together with you?

145
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,510
Maybe you're right.

146
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,676
Or she's telling the truth
and just being nice.

147
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,519
Maybe you're right.
Wow, I am easy to manipulate.

148
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:39,715
Guys, it's Emily. What should I do?

149
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,115
Okay. Answer it.
Just be strong, and if she starts to cry,

150
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,038
don't make any promises,
and most importantly,

151
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:45,467
put it on speaker so we can hear.

152
00:07:49,119 --> 00:07:50,996
-He||o.
-EM|LY: Hey, it's Emily.

153
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,155
Is this a good time?

154
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,358
Yeah, yeah, sure. What's up?

155
00:07:56,559 --> 00:08:00,711
Was it okay I left that gift?
I'm really hoping we can be friends.

156
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,431
Maybe, maybe.

157
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:09,752
Um, you think you'd wanna
grab a cup of coffee?

158
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,754
Hello?

159
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:25,031
I'm sorry, I seem to be taking
an annoying amount of time

160
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:26,433
deciding how I feel about this!

161
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:31,713
I just... I miss hanging outwith you.

162
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,831
It's not like I lost a friend,
it's like I lost my best friend.

163
00:08:35,319 --> 00:08:38,470
(SOBBING) Is there any chance
you'd wanna come over?

164
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,834
I'm sorry.
I don't think that's a good idea.

165
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,918
Okay.
I'm just, I'm having a really hard time,

166
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,680
but that's not your problem, that's mine.

00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:53,517

but please know that you'll
always have a place in my heart.

170
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:05,149
Bye, Raj. You're a good guy.

171
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,839
Goodbye, Emily.

173
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:11,588
That was rough, you guys.

174
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,518
I know, but you did it.
I'm so proud of you.

175
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,074
(SIGHS) Well, anyway,
I'll leave you to your girls' night.

176
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:17,997
Are you sure you
don't wanna stay here with us?

177
00:09:18,199 --> 00:09:19,871
No, I kind of
feel like being alone right now.

178
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,992
Well, if you change your mind,
we'll be here.

179
00:09:22,199 --> 00:09:23,473
Thank you.

180
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,309
Say hi to Emily for us.

181
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,668
Will do.

182
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,792
Yeah, this contract looks good to me.

183
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:39,072
I'll say it looks good.
It's in my proprietary font, Shelvetica.

184
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:45,556
I wanna say something obnoxious,
but it is easy on the eyes.

185
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,272
I'm a little tired, Howie,
you ready to go?

186
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,550
Yeah, one sec.
ljust need to sign this contract.

187
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:52,669
What is it?

188
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:54,471
Well, we ran into a problem
about my share of the patent,

189
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,877
so we're forming a partnership
to split anything we make equally.

190
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,588
Sheldon, did you draft the contract?

191
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,074
You bet I did.

192
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:03,675
You're gonna make out so hard tonight.

193
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,475
So, you're just gonna sign this
without having a lawyer look at it?

194
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,468
Excuse me, I've been drafting contracts
since kindergarten.

195
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,193
Didn't need a lawyer to get me
out of finger painting,

196
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,389
don't need one now.

197
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:19,869
I know, but--

198
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,230
Bernie, the guys were nice enough to find
a way to keep me from being cut out.

199
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,718
Well, I should hope so.
The whole thing was your idea.

200
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,393
Well, to be fair,
Howard's idea was based on Sheldon's math.

201
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,989
Guys, everyone is involved in this, okay?

202
00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:36,235
Howard's invention, Sheldon's math,

203
00:10:36,439 --> 00:10:39,397
my original theory that space time
was like a super-cooled liquid,

204
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,079
which I'm sure Penny would've mentioned

205
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,236
if she wasn't working on
that hangnail right now.

206
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,469
What?

207
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,311
-Honey, this is fine.
-Okay.

208
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:53,238
You wanna sign a contract
that Sheldon whipped up, go ahead.

209
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,039
Can I talk to you in the hall?

210
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,872
-Sure.
-Excuse us.

211
00:10:59,319 --> 00:11:00,229
Hey, Leonard.

212
00:11:00,439 --> 00:11:01,428
What?

213
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:03,755
If she doesn't think
that we should apply for this patent,

214
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:06,473
she's being patently absurd.

215
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,354
Good one.

216
00:11:11,319 --> 00:11:13,753
Okay, you got it.
See, I was afraid it was a thinker.

217
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,628
What are you doing?

218
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,477
| just wanna make sure
you've thought this through.

219
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,590
What's to think about?

220
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,791
We have an invention
and wanna move forward.

221
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:27,470
Howie, you're about to form
a legal partnership with Sheldon Cooper.

222
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,554
All right, if you're gonna
calmly make excellent points

223
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,272
then I don't know if I wanna talk to you.

224
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:38,957
Okay, I get it.

225
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,914
And it's sweet that you're worried
about me, but I can take care of myself.

226
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,873
I'm not worried about you,
I'm worried about me.

227
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,037
I don't wanna go through this pregnancy
listening to you complain about Sheldon

228
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,515
driving you crazy
more than you already do.

229
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,393
Here we go with the ironclad logic again.

230
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,399
You've tried to work with him before,
it hasn't gone well.

231
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:01,796
Why is this time gonna be any different?

232
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,070
Is the fetus helping you?
'Cause that's cheating.

-He||o.
-Hey, Raj. It's Claire, how are you?

235
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,270
Hi, I'm good. Really good.

236
00:12:16,479 --> 00:12:18,834
Well, I don't know why I said
"really good," I'm just regular good.

237
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,598
| reallyjust wanted to sound confident.

238
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:22,152
And that "really" was a real really,

239
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:24,156
not a fake "really"
like the first "really."

240
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,429
Really?

241
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,313
I don't know,
I lost track and I missed my exit.

242
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:31,670
So, uh, so what's up?

243
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:35,429
Well, last time we talked I had just
gotten back together with my boyfriend

244
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:37,789
and I wanted to let you know
that things didn't work out.

245
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,673
Really?
I'm sorry, I swear I know other words.

246
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:43,633
So if you were still interested--

247
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,433
Yes! Indeed. Absolutely. Indubitably.

248
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,517
I'm not even sure what the last one means,
but it's another word and I know it.

249
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,518
So, when do you wanna meet up?

250
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,393
Um, I'm almost off work,
what are you doing now?

251
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,477
Right now? Well...

252
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,673
Well, actually, to be completely honest,

253
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,997
I'm stopping by to see my ex-girlfriend
because she's having a tough time,

254
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,951
but it's not like
we're getting back together or anything.

255
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,627
Let me guess,
the worst part about breaking up

256
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,479
is that she doesn't have
her best friend to talk to anymore?

257
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:13,273
That's exactly what she said!
How do you know that?

258
00:13:13,479 --> 00:13:16,152
I'm a girl,
that's like page one out of the playbook.

259
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:19,513
Any chance
you could send me a PDF of that playbook?

260
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,549
Been out there awhile.

261
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:24,908
Hope everything's okay.

262
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,473

263
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,636
If you guys would shut up,
I could tell you.

264
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,673
Oh, be cool, be cool, be cool.

00:13:33,719 --> 00:13:34,947
-Hey.
-He||o.

266
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:36,069
Hey. You guys all right?

267
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:40,158
Yeah. But, um, we were talking and...

268
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:44,435
I'm a little concerned about
the three of us forming a partnership.

269
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,910
Are you suggesting
a limited liability corporation?

270
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,547
'Cause I did not L-L-see that coming.

271
00:13:55,199 --> 00:14:00,478
Sheldon, my concern is not with the money
or anything, it's with how you treat me.

272
00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:03,634
Well, I believe
I'm treating you generously.

273
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,637
That's why I've stipulated
in the contract that your contributions

274
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:09,114
to our invention
are as valuable as my own.

275
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,717
Are you saying that his contributions
aren't as valuable as yours?

276
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,033
No, I'm not saying that,
because I kept saying that this morning

277
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:18,638
and Leonard said stop saying that.

278
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:23,627
See, this is what happens
every time we work together.

279
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,355
You know, hang on. What if Sheldon
had no choice but to be respectful?

280
00:14:28,719 --> 00:14:31,358
What? Is there a switch on the back
of his neck we don't know about?

281
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:35,309
No. What I'm saying is,
you could add a clause to the contract

282
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:36,714
that he can't make fun of Howard.

283
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:38,034
How would you enforce it?

284
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,310
Oh, please, any contract I sign

285
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:42,908
is enforced by my own personal code
of ethics.

286
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,315
-And his obsessive-compulsive disorder.
-Yeah, that, too.

287
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,599
And scoot over,
part of your shadow is on my spot. Move.

288
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,758
Howard, what do you think?

289
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:56,869
I'm on board.

290
00:14:57,079 --> 00:14:58,034
Good. I'll add it right now.

291

she sounded pretty upset.

00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:36,116
You mean like, "I wasjust really
looking forward to seeing you."

That's very generous, Sheldon.

334
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:10,988
Oh, I've always valued education
over money.

335
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,236
And the very fact that you needed
a written guarantee of respect

336
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:17,272
made me realize how dismissive
I've been of your contributions.

337
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,515
I appreciate that.

338
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,599
And ljust hope that this scholarship
can rescue your child

339
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:27,394
from the subpar education
and menial life of an engineer.

340
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,200
-She|don.
-What? I didn't sign it yet.

341
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,232
I hear what you're saying,
but I've known Emily a long time

342
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,510
and think she deserves
the benefit of the doubt.

343
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:49,276
All right, it's your life,
but you know how this is gonna end.

344
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,038
As a matter of fact, I do.

345
00:17:51,239 --> 00:17:53,753
I'm gonna comfort her
because I'm a caring and decent friend

346
00:17:53,959 --> 00:17:57,190
who's happy to be there
when she needs someone to talk to.

347
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,995
Good talk.

348
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:30,108
