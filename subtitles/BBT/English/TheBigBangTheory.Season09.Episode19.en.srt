it should go quicker.

these pipe fittings with Teflon tape.

you'd spoken to the guy.

Okay, that's cool.

175
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,629
Guess everybody's involved
in this project but me.

176
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,591
So, see ya.

177
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,069
I feel bad,
should we have asked him to stay?

178
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,269
RAJ: (GIRLY VOICE) Yes.

179
00:09:04,439 --> 00:09:06,475
Will you please tell me where we're going?

180
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,513
Sorry, you're on a need-to-know basis.

181
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,239
I'm driving the car, I need to know.

182
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,195
Right.

183
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:16,548
So where are we going?

184
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:18,477
No, I meant turn right and you missed it.

185
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,198
Maybe you do need to know.

-It's not a problem.
-I mean, without lying.

And now you've made it a problem.

Come on, we're a couple of smart guys,

191
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,239
I'm sure we can come up
with a way to explain this

192
00:09:36,439 --> 00:09:37,758
that doesn't make us look bad.

put the spare on before we go back.

Raj. He really wants to see this movie.

-Oh, he'll never make it in time.
-I know.

leave the room for a moment?

What's going on?

00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,833
Leonard and Howard don't have a flat.
They went to the movies. Look.

-Un-freakin'-believable!

that I'm here with you
and that they're busted.

No, you know what, don't. Don't.

Let's let them think
they're getting away with it.

they could dig for themselves.

(SIGHS) Just wait.

232
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:29,952
How long have you had it?

00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,388
Just wait.

00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,511
Do you want me to hold that computer?

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,631
Just... You know what, actually, yes,
thank you.

236
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:47,792
Welcome to my fortress of shame.

237
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:56,107
I'm sorry, what am I looking at?

238
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:59,507
Basically everything I've ever owned.

239
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,080
Um, every book, every T-shirt,

240
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,432
every piece of broken electronics,
just... All of it.

241

All of it?

I have a Ziploc bag
filled with all my old Ziploc bags.

00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,595
Okay. Well...

244
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,837
I would like to tell you

that there is nothing here
to be ashamed of.

So I'm gonna need a minute.

00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,470
All right, how are we gonna
play this when they return?

248
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,597
I know, you guys should
totally be making out with me.

249
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,276
Sweetie, I know you think
jokes like that are funny,

250
00:12:57,479 --> 00:13:00,391
but do you really think you could
handle makin' out with both of us?

251
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:03,348
(INHALES DEEPLY) No, ma'am.

252
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:08,078
Okay, okay, how about this.

253
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,510
They don't know you're here with us,
so you hide in the closet.

254
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,756
When they show up, we'll hear
whatever their dumb story is

255
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,916
about where they were,
we'll pretend to believe them,

256
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,190
and just when they think
they got away with it, you jump out.

257
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,389
Yeah, that's pretty good.

258
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:21,067
I love it! I'll be all like, "Busted!"

259
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,758
And they'll be like, "What?"

260
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,836
And then we'll all be like, "Oh, yeah!"

261
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,034
Yeah, I get it, I wouldn't make out
with me either.

262
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,349
In here is every clock radio
I've ever owned.

263
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:40,236
Calculators, VHS tapes,
yeah, sporting equipment.

264
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,552
You have sporting equipment?

265
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:48,798
Well, it's a golf ball
that my brother threw at my head.

266
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,111
You can still feel the dent.

267
00:13:52,319 --> 00:13:54,310
It's right next to the hockey-puck dent.

268
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,997
Okay, why do you have a bin of pinecones?

269
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,792
I used to collect them as a child.

The spiral of scales open
in the Fibonacci sequence.

271
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,228
A fact that, when you tell your brother,
gets a golf ball thrown at your head.

272
00:14:12,439 --> 00:14:16,318
So, why do you feel
you need to save these things?

273
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,834
I'd like to say it's nostalgia,

274
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,996
but every time I think
of throwing anything away

275
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:25,509
my ears start to ring
and I get butterflies in my stomach.

276
00:14:25,719 --> 00:14:29,155
And then it feels like
the butterflies get eaten by rats.

277
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,273
-And then the rats get eaten by--
-Okay, I get it. I get it.

278
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,671
It ends with dinosaurs.

279
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,995
I'm sorry if you think less of me.

280
00:14:42,719 --> 00:14:43,788
I don't.

281
00:14:44,319 --> 00:14:45,354
Really?

282
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:49,036
Because every time I come in here,
I think less of me.

283
00:14:49,439 --> 00:14:50,474
Why?

284
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,352
Because I'm a fraud.

285
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,429
I purport to be a man of the mind.

286
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:59,029
I've been such a vocal champion
of The Singularity,

287
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,437
but how can I leave my body behind
and become one with the Internet

288
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,517
when I've never even thrown
a toothbrush away?

289
00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:12,756
It's okay, Sheldon, you know,
I've saved a lot of weird things, too.

290
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,709
Like what?

291
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,717
Well...

292
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,435
Um, did you know I have a microscope slide
with a little bit of tissue

293
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:23,869
from the first brain I ever dissected.

294
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,875
I have an old teddy bear I secretly
wiped my nose on for years.

295
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,993
It's not a contest.

296
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,470
-Okay, here they come.
-Go hide.

297
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,355
Oh, man, when I come out of the closet
I'm gonna nail those guys.

298
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,795
Yeah, I heard it, shut up.

299
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,633
-Hey.
-Hi.

300
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,238
Hey, what's this?

301
00:15:59,439 --> 00:16:01,350
Listen, we did a stupid thing.

302
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,551
We went to a movie and lied about it,

303
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,114
but we feel bad
and wanna make it up to you.

304
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:08,150
So, these are for you,
and if you're not too mad,

305
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,839
we'd love to take you guys to dinner.

306
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,314
Yeah, anywhere you want.

307
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,592
Well, thank you for being honest.

308
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,869
Yeah, you know, I wanna be upset,

309
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:17,035
but we did kinda have fun
working on the prototype.

310
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,958
RAJ: Don't forgive them! Stay mad at them!

311
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,477
What is he doing in there?

312
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,439
Busting you!

313
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,039
It's okay, they apologized.

314
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,798
Yeah, it's fine.

315
00:16:29,999 --> 00:16:32,718
Well, this is kinda anti-climactic.

316
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,112
You know what wasn't anti-climactic?
The end of the movie! Get this.

317
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,072
No spoilers! No spoilers!

318
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,957
And he's back in the closet.

319
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,597
-Ready for dinner?
-Yeah.

320
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:51,552
Should we invite Raj?

321
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,749
RAJ: (GIRLY VOICE) Yes.

322
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,192
So, no one else knows about this?

323
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:00,154
Only you.

324
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,913
Thank you for trusting me.

325
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:06,193
What good is having a girlfriend

326
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,789
if you can't unload your
psychological sewage on her?

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,472
That's me, your emotional outhouse.

328
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,512
You know, if you ever decide
you want to do something about this,

329
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,153
I'm here for you.

330
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,475
Thank you.

331
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,671
I wouldn't even know how to begin.

332
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,228
Baby steps, I guess.

333
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,950
I suppose I could try
getting rid of the golf ball.

334
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:42,191
Oh. Okay.

335
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,710
I will always have the dent
to remember it by.

338
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,555
You did it.

339
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,668
Do you feel okay?

340
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,950

I'm glad I told you
about the storage unit.

344
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,595
Well, I feel closer to you now.

345
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,437
I feel closer to you, too.

346
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:41,107
You know, it's still a couple of hours
until my bed time.

347
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:49,831
What did you have in mind?

348
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,232
You look amazing.

349
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,996
I mean, this resolution is remarkable.

350
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,911
I really had to go home for this?

351
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,511
Yes, but it's like
you're right here in the room.

352
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,392
And yet, I'm not.

353
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:15,595
But I feel like I could just
reach out and touch you.

354
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:17,073
And yet, you can't.

355
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:20,918
I know!

00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:30,115
