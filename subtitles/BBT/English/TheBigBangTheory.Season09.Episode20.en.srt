00:00:24,759 --> 00:00:29,230

You ruined it with your actual face.

What am | smelling?

10
00:00:32,319 --> 00:00:35,755
It's car air freshener.
I was simulating the smell of the forest.

11
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:38,152
That's not what the forest smells like.

12
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:39,792
Well, how would I know?

13
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:44,715
Why are you pretending
to be outdoors? You hate it.

00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:47,634
Oh, Amy showed me a compelling study

15
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:50,797
that demonstrated the cognitive benefit
of spending time in the wilderness.

drive you into the wilderness

-What's the game?
-All right.

00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:34,876
It's called Never Have I Ever.
The rules are simple.

173
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:38,112

00:09:38,319 --> 00:09:39,308
I've never played that before.

175
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,119
Hey, now wait, have we started,
do | drink, what is happening?

176
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,038
Okay, just calm down, I'll go first.

177
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,957
All right, let's see. Never have I ever...

178
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,195
She's trying to think of something
she's never done before,

179
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,514
this could take a while.

180
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,869
Very funny.

181
00:09:56,079 --> 00:09:57,637
Okay, never have I ever...

182
00:09:59,439 --> 00:10:01,111
Yeah, you know what,
let's just circle back.

183
00:10:02,199 --> 00:10:04,997
Okay, I'll go.
Never have I ever been arrested.

184
00:10:05,199 --> 00:10:06,268
So I drink?

185
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,072
No, it's only if you've done it.

186
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,395
Got it.

187
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:14,431
I can't believe you've been arrested.

188
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:16,391
Hmm, I can't believe Penny hasn't.

189
00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:18,474
(CHUCKLING)

190
00:10:19,199 --> 00:10:20,552
Sheldon, what did you do?

191
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,514
Well, I'm not proud of it,
but... ljaywalked.

192
00:10:24,719 --> 00:10:28,553
Oh, no, it's like a horror movie,
we're trapped in a cabin with a maniac!

193
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:32,072
I'm surprised you would do that.

194
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:33,997
No, I, I crossed in
the middle of the street.

195
00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:38,477
And normally I wouldn't, but I saw
an aggressive looking girl scout and...

196
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,114
Yeah, it was the heart of cookie season.

197
00:10:41,319 --> 00:10:44,629
Anyway, there was a police officer,
and he witnessed the whole thing.

198
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:46,272
What, he arrested you for that?

199
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,708
Hmm? Uh, no, he didn't do anything.

200
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,117
So I said, "You just saw me jaywalk,
why aren't you doing yourjob? You know?

201
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,119
(STUTTERS) "Maybe I should arrest you
for, for impersonating a police officer."

202
00:10:58,279 --> 00:10:59,553
And then you got arrested.

203
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:00,828
Oh, and how.

204
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,511
lfeel like ljust made
a horrible mistake.

205
00:11:06,719 --> 00:11:07,708
Yeah.

206
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,434
But on the other hand,
I didn't kick him out of our lives.

207
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:12,789
ljust asked him to back off a little.

208
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,274
Yeah.

209
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,869
What? You gonna cry?

210
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,795
Yeah!

211
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:23,079
Baby hormones or actually sad?

212
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,317
I can't tell anymore! (SOBS)

213
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,159
I'll go get him.

214
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,079
And bring back the bear! (SOBS)

215
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,070
This game's dangerous,
I could get you in trouble.

216
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:39,268
H ow?

217
00:11:39,439 --> 00:11:43,273
Well, never have I ever used
Sheldon's toothbrush to clean the sink.

218
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:52,154
Fine. Is that how you play this?
All right.

219
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,557
Never have I ever come up
with a nickname for my own genitals.

220
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,150
Never should have told you about
Alvin and the Chipmunks.

221
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,514
Okay, my turn.

222
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,788
Um...

223
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,518
Never have I ever completely rocked
my girlfriend's world in bed.

224
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:13,668
Amy.

225
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,477
You know the rules. Drink.

226
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,951
-(CLEARS THROAT)
-Yeah, go ahead.

227
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,915
That's right.

228
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,591
All right, my turn. Um...

229
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:29,278
Oh! I know.

230
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,631
Never have I ever kept
a secret bank account

231
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,638
because I think
my wife can't handle money.

232
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,831
Did lwin? | feel like I won.

233
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,993
I can't believe this.

234
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,838
You realize I make more money than you.

235
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,917
Yeah, I know. But this isn't a big deal.

236
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,712
It's just a little savings I put aside.

237
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,150
We're married.
We're supposed to share everything.

238
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,920
What? You mean, like,
your massive credit card debt?

239
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,669
(DOOR SLAMS)

240
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,558
I'm calling it, lwon.

241
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:10,151
I appreciate the apology,
but it's really not necessary.

242
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,679
l overstepped my bounds.

243
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:13,028
No, Raj. You've been great.

244
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,435
ljust need to start doing my part
around here.

245
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:16,628
BERNADETTE: I hear that.

246
00:13:19,479 --> 00:13:21,947
Well, if that's the case,
is there anything I can do to help?

247
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:25,432
Well, not right now, but we could
try out that microphone you got us

248
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:26,754
and listen to the baby's heartbeat.

249
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,628
Really? (STUTTERS)
It's okay if I listen with you?

250
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,909
Of course.

251
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,953
(GASPS) Can I squirt the ultrasound jelly
on your stomach?

252
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:38,110
Hey, look at that, it's weird again.

253
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,595
(DOOR OPENING)

254
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,437
Okay, you have every right to be mad.

255
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:47,630
And what you said is true,
you do make more money than me.

256
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,114
Sol had no right to do what I did.

257
00:13:50,319 --> 00:13:52,310
And I'm so sorry.
I hope you can forgive me.

258
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,273
How long have you had this secret account?

259
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,712
A couple years, but I just put a few bucks
aside every month for emergencies.

260
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,148
Well, how much you got in there?

261
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,555
$6,427,

262
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,876
$47 once my nana's
birthday check gets here.

263
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,474
My God, Leonard, do you know what
I could do with that kind of money?

264
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,591
No, I do, and that's why! hid it.

265
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,712
What good is it if you don't use it?

266
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,912
Uh, you have shoes you love
but never wear.

267
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,314
l have money I love but never spend.

268
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,431
We're kind of a cute couple that way.
(CHUCKLES)

269
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,958
Again, I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have kept it a secret.

270
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,995
Well, l have a secret
I've been keeping from you, too.

271
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,397
Is it a secret bank account?
'Cause that would be awesome. (CHUCKLES)

272
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,713
I hate myjob.

273
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,952
Really? Why?

274
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,754
Because I don't feel good
flirting with doctors for sales.

275
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:42,871
I mean, I know! make a lot of money,
but I haven't been happy for a while.

276
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:44,948
(SIGHS) Why didn't you tell me?

277
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,549
Because I know how important it is to you
that I'm having some success.

278
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,749
That's not true.

279
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,074
Okay, really? So you'd be fine

280
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,316
if I went back to acting
and waiting tables again?

281
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:54,111
If that's what you wanna do, yes.

282
00:14:54,319 --> 00:14:57,277
-Well, it's not what I wanna do.
-Oh, yes! (CHUCKLES)

283
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,715
Doesn't matter what I want.

284
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,478
Look, this job
is gonna get me out of debt,

285
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,591
so I'm gonna do the grown-up thing
and see it through.

286
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:06,956
Wow. That is the grown-up thing.

287
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:08,388
I guess.

288
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,515
I love you.

289
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,189

in the forest while it was raining.
