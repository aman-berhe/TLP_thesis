I have a question about Batman.

2
00:00:06,679 --> 00:00:09,352
Batman is a man who dresses up like a bat.

3
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:10,469
Yeah.

Man-Bat is a part-man, part-bat hybrid.

5
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:19,158
Now, if Man-Bat dressed up as a man
to fight crime,

6
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,475
would he be Man-Batman?

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,071
No, he'd be Bat-Man-Bat.

8
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:30,990
But wouldn't Man-Batman just be a Batman
that was bitten by a radioactive man?

9
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,871
But Batman is a man.

10
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,878
You're talking about a man
who would have the powers of a man.

11
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,751
That's just Man-Man.

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,838

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,473
But what if Man-Man dressed as a bat?

14
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:43,589
Well, that's just Batman.

15
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:46,074
No, if a man dresses as a bat,
that's Batman,

16
00:00:46,279 --> 00:00:48,713
but if Man-Man dresses as a bat,
that's Bat-Man-Man.

00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,950

No, I'm fine.

Because usually we walk side by side,

-Oh...

Please. What could you possibly have
that I would be jealous of?

It's not always because they die.

it's because they've become involved

00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,474
How come your head has your face on it?

344
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,793
They don't wear bicycle helmets
in Game of Thrones.

345
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:10,515
You're thematically inaccurate,
but I applaud your commitment to safety.

346
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,596
Don't you guys have anything better to do?

347
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,519
Better than watching a guy in a fur cloak
ride a girl's bike?

348
00:16:17,719 --> 00:16:18,788
-Nope.
-(ALL CHUCKLE)

349
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:21,354
That's it!

350
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,950
You just lost bathroom privileges
at the comic book store.

351
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,475
Horse has a basket on its stupid...

352
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,635
(SCREAMS)

353
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:35,794

-SHELDON: Leonard.

355
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,875
Leonard.

356
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:47,188
Leonard.

357
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,595
What?

358
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:51,638
I never got to ask my question
about Batman.

359
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,475
What is it?

360
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,956
If Batman were bitten by a radioactive
Man-Bat,

361
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,271
and then fought crime
disguised as Man-Bat,

362
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,199
would he be Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Man

363
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,756
or, simply, Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Batman?

364
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:15,198
Is he still wearing the Batman suit
under the Man-Bat suit?

365
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:18,994
I'll be back.
