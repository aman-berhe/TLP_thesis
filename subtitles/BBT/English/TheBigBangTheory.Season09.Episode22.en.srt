00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:05,237
Oh, hey, if you guys are free
this weekend,

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:06,998
I won a night of wine tasting from work.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,469
-That sounds fun.
-Mmm-hmm.

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:11,717
Like, how come scientists
don't win free stuff like sales people do?

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,957
'Cause we're not in it for the stuff.
(CHUCKLES) We're in it for the groupies.

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,914
Personally, I find the notion
of external rewards demeaning.

7
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,078
I pursue science
for the intrinsic joy of discovery.

8
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:25,949
But you always say
that you wanna win a Nobel Prize.

9
00:00:26,839 --> 00:00:28,352
I also say, "Don't contradict me
in front of my friends,"

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,549
but that you don't remember.

11
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,347
All right. Well, let me know
if you guys wanna go.

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,470
I would love to.

13
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:36,512
I do enjoy the complexity
of an aged Pinot Noir.

14
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,473
I'm sure that would pair nicely
with your five nuggets of chicken.

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,317
Well, it sounds like a nice night.
We should go.

16
00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:45,510
Wine again? Yeah, no, thank you.

17
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,553
I like my grapes the old-fashioned way,
in ajuice box.

18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,875
Well, I'm going.

19
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,832
You couldn't stop me
from getting a massage at the mall,

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,267
and you're not stopping me now.

21
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,950
I shouldn't have to see my girlfriend
get groped in public by another man.

22
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,069
And I shouldn't have to see

23
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,748
my boyfriend riding on a train
for children, around the mall.

24
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,238
The little choo-choo for toddlers?

25
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:08,191
And now you know whyl needed the massage.

26
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:10,629
Well, we're out.

27
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,717
Bernie can't drink, 'cause she's pregnant.

28
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,879
And she's pregnant because we had sex,
and we had sex because, well... (CHUCKLES)

29
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:18,034
Come on.

30
00:01:20,199 --> 00:01:21,598
It's okay, you should go.

31
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:23,278
-You sure?
-Of course.

32
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,232
Yeah, give her a break from...

33
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,713
Well, come on.

34
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:31,034
Well, Bernadette, looks like
Saturday night, it's you and me.

35
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,595
Me? How? Why?

36
00:01:34,199 --> 00:01:35,268
Well, it makes perfect sense.

37
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:38,789
Look, because you're an expectant mother,
you can't drink alcohol, I don't like to.

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,036
You can't have sushi, and I don't like to.

39
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,639
You can't go in hot tubs.

40
00:01:42,839 --> 00:01:45,307
I consider them
vats of sweaty-people soup.

41
00:01:47,279 --> 00:01:48,473
Gee, Sheldon, I don't know.

42
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,150
Oh, come on. Well, roller coasters,
caffeine, runny eggs.

43
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,998
I've been avoiding these things
all my life.

44
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,077
And now, because you're pregnant,
you have to.

45
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,236
The difference is,
she's bringing life into the world,

46
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,394
and you sucked it out.

47
00:02:02,679 --> 00:02:03,794
I guess we could give it a try.

48
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,316
Well, little lady,
you've heard of party hardy.

49
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:08,032
Get ready to party hardly.

50
00:02:10,279 --> 00:02:11,678
I bet you'd like a drink right now.

(THEME SONG PLAYING)

52
00:02:39,999 --> 00:02:42,194
Hey, you think it'd be okay
if I brought Claire to the wine tasting?

53
00:02:42,399 --> 00:02:43,434
Sure, I'd like to meet her.

54
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,358
Oh, that's great. I've been wanting
her to meet you guys, too.

55
00:02:45,559 --> 00:02:47,072
So, this seems
like the perfect opportunity.

56
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:48,548
But I won't be there.

57
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,749
Funny how that worked out.

58
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,679
Does this mean
Emily's not in the picture anymore?

59
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:54,868
No, I'm still dating her.

60
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,275
Okay, help me out.

61
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,835
How are you doing this?
Do they know about each other?

62
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,635
They know that we're not exclusive,
and we just don't ask too many questions.

63
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,308
You know what, it's like howl play
Warlords of Ka'a with you,

64
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,987
and Elder Sign with Frank and Alicia.

65
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,355
Who's Frank and Alicia?

66
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,988
You and I spend a lot of time together.
Can there be a little mystery between us?

67
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,512
Okay, everything's hooked up, we're ready.
(CHUCKLES)

68
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,190
I am going to record this for posterity.

69
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,958
All right, here goes nothing.

70
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:25,234
"Here goes nothing"?

71
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,998
This is the initial test
for our prototype.

72
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,555
-Can we give it a little more gravitas?
-Fine.

87
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:10,035
if you're free Saturday night. (CHUCKLES)

88

All my friends
are going to a wine tasting.

89
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,715
Sure.

90
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:16,956
I guess. If you don't think
meeting your friends is too big a step.

91
00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:19,430
Why would it be too big a step?

92
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,229
I don't know,
I just don't want things to get weird.

93
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:25,236
Nothing to worry about.

94
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,954
People meet people all the time,
and it isn't weird.

95

I met Bon Jovi once,

96
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,113
which you'd think might be weird.
Turns out, total sweetheart.

97
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,710
Okay, but you and l
have been keeping things casual.

98
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,514
Will you introduce me as your friend
or as your girlfriend?

99
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,037
What if I like them
and they don't like me?

100
00:04:43,239 --> 00:04:45,150
What if they like me
and I don't like them?

101
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:47,995
Boy, it wasn't this hard with Bon Jovi.

102
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:50,838
I said, "You rock!"
He said, "Thanks, man." And that was that.

What are you doing?

Oh, I found a scratch-and-sniff book
about wine tasting.

107

It teaches
the different flavor notes to look for.

-| mostlyjust smell my nasal spray.

with Bernadette tonight?

we don't need alcohol to enjoy ourselves.

-Yeah. Hey, buddy.
-Hello.

182
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:29,758
Hey, did you two get married?

183

when you broke up with him and dated me,

187
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,036

and then dated me one more time

Thanks.

So, how's the science world?
What're you guys up to?

192
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,512
We've actually been working on a prototype
for a navigation system we invented.

193
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,835
But we won't bore you with the details.

194
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,996
Are you kidding? I love science.

195
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,397
Einstein, Stephen Hawking,
Mike deGrasse Tyson.

196
00:09:01,319 --> 00:09:02,638
Mike deG rasse Tyson?

197
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:06,195
Yeah, you know, the boxer who grew
a mustache and became a scientist.

198
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:08,954
So, what's your invention?

199
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:14,155
Well, we're using quantum vortices
to replace gyroscopes in guidance systems.

200
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,272
And what's neat is that they can
maintain angular momentum indefinitely.

201
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:20,439
Angular momentum.
l was wondering about that.

202
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,068
You could put it in a satellite
or a rocket, and it'll run forever.

203
00:09:27,319 --> 00:09:28,434
Cool.

204
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:30,675
Could it be used
for missiles and war stuff?

205
00:09:31,439 --> 00:09:33,999
Yeah, but we didn't create it for weapons.

206
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,952
And I doubt the military would be
interested in our little guidance system.

207
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,478
Is it better than the one they use now?

208
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,907
-A lot!
-Way better!

209
00:09:41,439 --> 00:09:42,394
Huh.

You sure you guys are smart?

I'm sorry, I have to ask.

216
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,674
When I was five,
I ingested a Z gauge locomotive.

217
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:11,198
I spent the next three days saying,

218
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,437
"I think I can pass it, lthink
I can pass it, I think I can pass it."

that you like so much?

220
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:21,310
(SIGHS) Interesting question.

221
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:25,838
When I was a child,
life was confusing and chaotic for me,

222
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,519
and trains represented order.

223
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,429
I could line them up,
categorize them, control them.

224
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,875
I guess you could say

225
00:10:33,319 --> 00:10:36,072
that they gave me
a sense of calm in a world that didn't.

-Yeah.

l have to admit, I've been worried

230
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,079
about the military applications
since we started talking about this.

231
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:51,394
Me, too.

Why didn't you say something?

Same reason I don't talk about ass cancer,
it's not a pleasant topic.

Hey, you can't let this stop you.

235

Almost any scientific advancement
can be used for destructive purposes.

236
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:04,955
That's true.
Even Einstein's theory of relativity

237

was later applied
to the development of nuclear weapons.

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,238
E equals MC squared.

and "C" for the speed of light.

00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:17,468
I can't risk getting amniotic fluid
on my spot.

339
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,800
Hey, dude, you're killing me with Claire.

340
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:24,954
What're you talkin' about?

341
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,350
Oh, I mean, come on, look at you.

342
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,313
You're classically handsome,
you've got a swimmer's body.

343
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,391
Next to you, I look like me.

344
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:36,155
Oh, man, I didn't mean to do that.

345
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,875
But I do appreciate you recognizing
my swimmer's body.

346
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,552
Which, incidentally, I got from playing
Marco Polo at the YMCA.

347
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,509
Yeah, okay.

348
00:16:47,719 --> 00:16:51,598
Just do me a favor, and stop
talking about how great Claire is.

349
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,072
Anything for you,
my little foreign friend.

350
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,993
So I gotta ask,
does Raj bring around other girls?

351
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,592
Uh, you know,
I'm not really around that much.

352
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,074
-Amy knows much more than I do.
-(SPUTTERS)

353
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,313
I don't think
you have anything to worry about.

354
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,988
Raj is a terrific guy, loyal to a fault.

355
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,078
Yeah, I mean, he still has an AOL address.

356
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:16,878
I see what you're sayin'.

357
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:18,788
She's not so great.

358
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,034
Don't listen to him.
He says crazy things all the time.

359
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,593
-Watch. Marco.
-Polo.

360
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,793
So, uh, what are you guys talking about?

361
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,912
Your friends were just telling me
about all the other girls you're dating.

362
00:17:39,199 --> 00:17:42,714
Why would you do that?
I specifically asked you not to do that.

363
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:45,035
-We didn't.
-You just did.

364
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,036
Wow. Maybe none of you guys are smart.

365
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,472
-Morning.
-Morning.

366
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:03,110
Ugh. Too much wine.

367
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,517
Oh, I overdid it myself last night.
Hair of the dog.

368
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,479
Hey, did you ever think about

369
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:12,909
the military applications
for the guidance system?

370
00:18:13,199 --> 00:18:14,473
Of course.

371
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,715
Does it bother you?

372
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:18,518
No. It did at first.

373
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,678
But then I talked it through
with Frank and Alicia,

374
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,109
and they really helped
put things into perspective.

375
00:18:27,879 --> 00:18:29,312
Who are these people?

376
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,075
Leonard.

377
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:33,837
Friends are like toilet paper.

378
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,072
It's good to have extras under the sink.

379
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,389
English - SDH
