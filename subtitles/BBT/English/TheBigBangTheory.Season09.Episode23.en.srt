-Kh|oé? Ah!
-Yes!

00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:30,070
See, I remember because
if it looks like Kim, it's Kim,

7
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:31,758
if it looks kind of like Kim,
it's Kourtney,

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,518
if it looks nothing like Kim, it's Khloé.

00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:36,993
Oh, that's a Venn diagram,

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,599
and I remember
because I thought to myself,

11
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:40,755
"Venn is he gonna stop talking
about this diagram?"

12
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,795
What're you guys doing?

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,355

Oh, hey, Penny, do you wanna go
to the airport with me later

20
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,875
to pick up my mother?

21
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:06,068
-Sure.
-LEONARD: Thanks.

22
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,190
No problem.

23
00:01:07,399 --> 00:01:09,867
Hey, Penny, since you're already
gonna be at the airport, do I need to go?

24
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,198
Why don't you wanna
get your mother from the airport?

25
00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:15,435
I can do without the 40-minute car ride

where she criticizes
every aspect of my life.

27
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,078
She can cover it in a car ride?

28
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,275
I can do 40 minutes on your posture alone.

29
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,836
You really want me
to pick up your mother all by myself?

30

ljust feel like it would be
a good chance for you to bond.

31
00:01:30,199 --> 00:01:31,632
Or a way for you to avoid her?

I don't know what he's putting on those
cards, but you are smarter than ever.

33
00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:39,073
Fine, if you really want me to,
I will pick your mom up.

34

Seriously?

35
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:41,752
Yeah, you know what,
she is my mother-in-law,

36
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,632
and I'd like for us to have
a good relationship.

37
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:48,068
That is very mature of you,
so I'm gonna go ahead and say, suckah!

-Okay.

Did you guys see
there's an Avengers screening?

46
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:29,274
Joss Whedon's gonna show
some deleted scenes

47
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,833
and do a question and answer session.

48
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,077
Well, l have a few questions for him
about the last Avengers movie,

49

and a whole lot of answers.

50
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,829
When's the screening?

51
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,712
lt's tonight,
but it's first come, first served,

52
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:42,637
so we should probably
get there early and wait in line.

53
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,034
Let's do it.

54
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,037
Penny's busy with my mother, so I'm in.

55
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,277
Bad news, Amy's making me
go shopping with her later,

56
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,391
so it looks like none of us can go.

00:02:54,279 --> 00:02:56,873
You do realize we're allowed
to have fun without you?

In fact, that's usually the trick to it.

59

What time do we need to get there?

60
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,039
Uh, I'd say by 3:00.

61
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,798
You're really going without me?

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,390
It's not a big deal. Go shopping with Amy,
and we'll save a spot in line for you.

63
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,273
You don't have the authority
to save places in the line.

to avoid picking me up.

He's battled intimacy issues
his whole life.

Does he have difficulty
maintaining erections?

make it out of the parking lot.

Dear, I'm a psychiatrist.

82

You don't have to avoid having
intimate conversations with me.

83
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,270
Well, I'd actually like
for us to be close,

84
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,118
but maybe we start with our favorite books

85
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,709
and work our way up
to my husband's sex organs.

86
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,996
Very well. What's the last book you read?

Uh, does Pottery Barn Spring count?

88
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:24,429
Penny, it's only natural to want
your mother-in-law to like you,

89
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,393
and I acknowledge
I can be an intimidating person.

90
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,879
So, what can I do
to make this process easier for you?

91
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,277
For starters, maybe you can
not psychoanalyze everything I say?

92
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,750
And how does it make you feel when
l psychoanalyze everything you say?

93
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,588
Uncomfortable.

94
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,789
That was ajoke, dear.

95
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,399
Oh, sorry.

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,279

Or do | invite a few girlfriends?

101
00:04:57,039 --> 00:04:59,758
'Cause hearing you say "the two of us"
just sent a chill right down my spine.

You're not Sheldon.

104
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,153
I thought that might come up.

105
00:05:12,799 --> 00:05:14,596
Sheldon hired me to go shopping with you.

106
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,195
Hold on, he paid you
to get out of spending time with me?

107
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,470
No, it's not like that.

108
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,352
There's a long line he'd rather stand in.

109
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,434
So, what're we doing, Old Navy,
Build-A-Bear, | get paid either way.

110
00:05:30,799 --> 00:05:32,755
We're not going shopping together.

111

You sure? I'm happy to hold your bag,

112
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:36,829

for Hot Dog on a Stick.

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,350
Can you understand
whyl might be annoyed right now?

114
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:44,113
(CHUCKLING) Look, lady, ljust work here.

115
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:51,154
We've waited in a lot of lines together,
haven't we?

116
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,272
Remember when we camped out
for the Doctor Who panel at Comic-Con?

117
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,879
Yeah, sleeping under the stars

118
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,832
with other fans who love the show
as much as we do.

119
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,952
Waking up wondering
which of those fans stole our wallets.

120
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,867
Stuart, what're you doing here?

121
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:08,834
Sheldon, you are the most inconsiderate
person I have ever met in my entire life!

122
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,159
Where do you get off
sending me to shop with your girlfriend?

123
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:16,747
I don't understand. You were happy
to do this when I hired you.

124
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,678
Why are you upset with me now?

125
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,314
I'm not upset with you,
but Amy's pretty bent out of shape,

126
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:24,591
so she hired me to let you have it.

127
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,076
Well, I suppose turnabout is fair play.

128
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,840
You're darn right it's fair play,
you selfish jerk!

129
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,468
You know, just when I think we're
making progress in our relationship,

130
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,831
we revert to our old patterns where
thoughts and feelings go unexpressed.

131
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,918
I mean, if he didn't wanna go shopping
with me, why didn't he just say so?

132
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,831
Maybe he couldn't get a word in edgewise.

133
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,919
Sorry, I've been going on and on.

134
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,314
No, it's all right, dear.

135
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:57,397
Sheldon has a brilliant
and complicated mind.

136
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,513
lt's understandable that being in
a relationship with him could be trying.

137
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,188
I called him "babe" once.
He asked me to get a drug test.

138
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:10,556
Well, I do admire your resolve.
You're an extraordinary woman.

139
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,749
Thank you.

140
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:15,476
You know what, she's my mother-in-law,
why can't I bond with her like that?

141
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,628
Amy's with Sheldon
who she loves like a son.

142
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:21,399
You're with her son, who she doesn't.

143
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,913
Do you realize it took me five years
to get a massage from him?

144
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,396
Well, that still could be
a big step for Sheldon.

145
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,956
Three minutes.
And he used a kitchen timer.

146
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,833
I felt like a soft-boiled egg.

147
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,956
You know, being in a relationship
with Leonard

148
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,071
also comes with its challenges.

149
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,996

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

151
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,710
Maybe it's Sheldon,
here to say he's sorry.

00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,353
Sheldon says he's sorry.

153

Bernadette,
I'll give you $5 to slam the door.

154
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,909
I would've done it for $3.

155
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,797
Boy, all this standing's making me tired.

156
00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:12,957
Good thing I brought
my collapsible stick chair.

157
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,553
The stick chair.
You look like an idiot on that thing.

158
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,912
Sticks and stones may break my bones,
but chairs on sticks are comfy.

159
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,155
H ey.

160
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,157
Hey, is everything smoothed out with Amy?

161
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,998
Uh, no, she's still pretty mad.

162
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,272
Did you make the apology
as sincere as I would have?

163
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,675
I said, "Sheldon says he's sorry."

164
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:36,790
Yeah, well,
that's laying it on a little thick.

165
00:08:40,199 --> 00:08:42,394
Think it's time
you apologize to her yourself.

166
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:45,477
I suppose so, but if I get out of line,
l'll lose my spot.

167
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,910
I'm happy to hold your place
till you get back.

168
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,189
You would do that?

169
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,072
Consider it my way
of getting more of your money.

170
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,509
You're a good man.

171
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,675
So, Beverly, did you know
Penny is the number three sales rep

172
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:00,914
at our pharmaceutical company?

173
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,917
I didn't realize you two work together.

174
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,193
Well, we don't exactly, I'm
a microbiologist for the research team.

175
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,628
What are you currently developing?

176
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,956
BERNADETTE: Some exciting
new anti-anxiety drugs.

177
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:14,152
That's interesting. ljust attended
a lecture on pediatric anxiety.

178
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,033
Oh, was it Dr. Jenofski?
ljust saw his TED Talk.

179
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,355
BEVERLY: It was.

180
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,629
Well, let's get back to Penny.

181
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,798
Hey, weren't you telling me something
great about your company car?

182
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,071
Um... (CLEARING THROAT)

183
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:28,518
It has seat warmers.

184
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,635
(INTERMITTENT KNOCKING ON DOOR)

185
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,308
SHELDON: Amy, Amy, Amy.

186
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:35,668
Come in.

187
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,995
Hello, everyone.
Oh, Beverly, good to see you.

188
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,760
I'd love to chat, but there's a line
that could start moving any minute,

189
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,517
so let's do this.

190
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,517
Amy, a proper apology
requires three steps.

191
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,473
Step one, an admission of wrongdoing.
Amy, I was wrong.

192
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,353
Step two, a promise
never to repeat said action.

193
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,233
Amy, that action will never be repeated,
and that's a promise.

194
00:09:53,439 --> 00:09:55,157
Step three,
an earnest request for forgiveness.

195
00:09:55,359 --> 00:09:57,793
Amy, I hope you can forgive me,
and I hope you do it right now

196
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,194
'cause there's an Uber waiting downstairs,

197
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,039
and I don't wanna repeat this apology
nonsense with my driver, Ganesh.

198
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,155
Fine.

199
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,588
Oh, thanks, you're a peach.

200
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,789
And Beverly, we'll catch up soon.

201
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:11,638
Bernadette, it's a pleasure, as always.
Penny, you have spinach in your teeth.

202
00:10:14,999 --> 00:10:16,591
How long have I had spinach in my teeth?

203
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,028
Since the airport, dear.

204
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,113
You look like you come with a kickstand.

205
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,113
You can't make me feel bad.

206
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,392
Maybe not. Leonard?

207
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,029
So, when the aliens brought you back,
theyjust left the probe in?

208
00:10:36,439 --> 00:10:37,838
-l'm back.
-Hey, how'd it go?

209
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,029
It went well.

210
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,878
You know, I've learned that
if you never say you're sorry,

211
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:43,149
the times you do
really puts them on their heels.

212
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,751
Stuart, l relieve you of your line duties.

213
00:10:47,319 --> 00:10:48,877
Anyone else need anything before I go?

214
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:51,354
I'll give you a dollar
if you make fun of Raj.

215
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,033
-That's mean.
-Five.

216
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,470
You look like Tigger
if Tigger looked like ajackass.

217
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:01,199
If you ever need a reference
or anything, just let me know.

218
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:04,594
Hey, guys.

219
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,908
Did you see that?

220
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,394
He just cut the line.

221
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,953
He's just joining his friends, it's fine.

222
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:14,515
No, it's not fine.
It is a breach of line etiquette.

223
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,359
We're near the front of the line.
We'll get in either way.

224
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,278
What if every person in front of us
lets someone cut?

225
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,435
We'd still get in.

226
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:21,674
What if each of those people
let someone cut?

227
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:22,868
Still get in.

228
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,069
Then each of those people let someone cut?

229
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:27,316
We'd still get in, but first l'd hit you
over the head with his stick chair.

230
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,118
-Excuse me.
-Oh, please don't.

231
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,788
I couldn't help but notice
that you cut the line.

232
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,231
Oh, uh, I'm with my friends. It's cool.

233
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,954
No, it's not cool.

234
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,873
If there were reserved seating,
we all had tickets, that'd be fine,

235
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,353
but this line is first-come, first-served.

236
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,199
Not "show up tardy
and nevertheless be first-served."

237
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,753
-Right here.
-No.

238
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,279
You need to go to the back of the line.

239
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,836
(SCOFFS) Who made you line monitor?

240
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,951
Mrs. Wunch in fourth grade.

241
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,514
And my slogan was, "A line
this straight is a line that's great."

242
00:12:05,999 --> 00:12:06,988
Is this guy for real?

243
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,270
Boy, lwish I could say no.

244
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,388
That was very nice of Sheldon
to apologize.

245
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,750
Well, he's come a long way,

246
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:20,953
or a short way very slowly,
so it feels like a long way.

247
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,789
Your relationship with him is fascinating.

248
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,673
I'm preparing to write a book
on high-achieving couples,

249
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,472
and lwould love to interview
the both of you.

250
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,638
Oh, sure, I'll talk to Sheldon about it.

251
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:34,511
You know, Bernadette's husband's
a former astronaut.

252
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,789
Really?

253
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,468
Do you think he would be interested
in being interviewed as well?

254
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,193
Do I think he'd be interested?

255
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,037
Sometimes I hear him
pretending to be interviewed

256
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,593
when he's alone in the bathroom.

257
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,713
Wonderful, I'll give you
my contact information.

258
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,874
Um, you should
probably talk to Penny, too.

259
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,189
About what?

260
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,597
Okay, you know what, this is ridiculous.

261
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,597
I've been trying to make
a connection with you all day,

262
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,278
and clearly I'm getting nowhere.

263
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:06,395
Well, are you seeking a connection
orjust some form of validation?

264
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,792
What I was seeking was
some sort of friendship,

265
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,309
but at this point I'll take you
not insulting me to my face.

266
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,476
My intention was never to insult you.

267
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,399
You've been doing it all day.
Do you even know what an insult is?

268
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,636
Well, it's not a clinical term,

269
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,957
but one example would be
your marrying my son and not inviting me

270
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,071
or even telling me
the wedding was taking place.

271
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,714
Okay, good example.

272
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,473
What about Joss Whedon's work
makes you think he'd be okay

273
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,318
with rule-breakers and line-cutters?

274
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,991
The Avengers are rule-breakers, being
vengeful is in theirjob description.

275
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,714
They work for S.H.l.E. L. D.,

276
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,990
which is a sanctioned department
of the US government.

277
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,032
Now, do you work for a sanctioned
department of the US government?

278
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,559
As a matter of fact I do,

279
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:54,398
at a little place called the DMV.

280
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,597
He's got him there.
The "D" even stands for department.

281
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,920
Excuse me,
can I please see a show of hands?

282
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,873
Who here takes issue
with this person cutting the line?

283
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:10,428
Told you.

284
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,076
Well, what a sad state of affairs.

285
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,555
Now that you've all been
so ground down by life,

286
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:17,431
you don't even notice
when someone disrespects you.

287
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,108
I can't believe we're gonna get beat up,
and it's not because of your chair.

288
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:21,638
SHELDON: It's time for you to wake up.

289
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,591
You know, right now,
at the back of this line,

290
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,314
there's a movie fan like you
who's not going to get in

291
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,828
because this person simply doesn't care.

292
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,314
Yeah, well, 61 years ago,

293
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,238
there was another person
at the back of the line,

294
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:35,395
and her name was Rosa Parks.

295
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,237
Okay, you may have to pretend you're black
to get us out of here.

296
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,278
Let's all follow in that brave woman's
footsteps and stand up for ourselves.

297
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,040
Now, and I realize that
she stood up by remaining seated,

298
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,878
but now is not the time
to enjoy the irony of that.

299
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:56,594
Now, | ask you again,
who here takes issue with this person--

300
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,597
Why should we listen to you?
You cut the line yourself.

301
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,791
| most certainly did not.

302
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,638
I saw you.

303
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:07,229
If you're feeling dizzy,
it's because the tables have turned.

304
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,392
Excuse me, I paid someone
to wait in line for me,

305
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,431
and then when I arrived, he left.

306
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,029
So what you saw, my good woman,
was swapsies, not cutsies.

307
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,389
No, no, no, no, no, wait.

308
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,716
| ask you again, show of hands,
who here takes issue with--

309
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,194
Stop moving! He's gonna get in!

310
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,755
-Buddy, let it go.
-No, I can't, this isn't right.

311
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,871
-You did everything you could.
-No, I could've done more.

312
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:31,148
N ow, n ow.

313
00:15:31,359 --> 00:15:33,350
You denigrated the memory
of a great civil rights pioneer.

314
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,595
That's all anyone could ask.

315
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,351
To be honest, I'm surprised
you cared about the wedding at all.

316
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,551
I'm still human, Penny.

317
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,990
Not getting invited to my own
son's wedding is difficult to ignore.

318
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,158
I know how you feel.
She didn't invite any of us.

319
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,839
It was spur of the moment.

320
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,508
Well, we did get to see
a live stream of it on the Internet.

321
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,836
I could've watched it on the Internet?

322
00:15:59,479 --> 00:16:00,468
(WHISPERING) Thank you.

323
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,715
So, if we would've asked you
to come to Vegas to see us get married,

324
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,909
you would've come?

325
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,989
No, I would've said
you're making a huge mistake,

326
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:12,110
but an invitation would've been nice.

327
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,912
You really think we made a mistake?

328
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,271
At the time I did,
but I've never seen Leonard so happy,

329
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:22,912
so perhaps I was wrong.

330
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:25,674
Wow.

331
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,833
Okay, well, how about this?

332
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:33,715
Maybe while you're still in town, Leonard
and I can have another small ceremony,

333
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,239
