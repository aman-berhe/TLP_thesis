1
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,397
-Hey.
-Hi, how was the screening?

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,591
Oh, Sheldon invoked Rosa Parks

3
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:10,909
to make somebody, who cut the line,
feel bad,

4
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:13,632
but only the white people felt bad.

5
00:00:15,999 --> 00:00:17,227
I should have never
bought him that coloring book

6
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:18,991
that explains Black History Month.

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,395
How'd it go with my mother?

8
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,916
You know, it started a little rocky,
but I think we got to a good place.

9
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:26,912
Wow. Well done. (CHUCKLES)

10
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:28,228
Yeah, and when I dropped her off
at the hotel,

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,469
she even gave me a hug.

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,029
Did she think you were choking?

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,236
I'm sorry, that's great.
Thank you for spending time with her.

14
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:36,468
No problem.

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,113
So, listen, I don't know
if you have any plans next weekend,

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,113
but I kind of promised your mom
we'd have another wedding ceremony

17
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,759
so she could attend this time.

18
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:49,387
Wait, we're gonna get married again?

19
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,074
Yeah, kind of, but now
we can invite our friends and family.

20
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:53,878
Seems like a lot of trouble for a hug.

21
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:57,589
Come on, it'll be fun. And you know,
your mom was genuinely hurt

22
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,079
we didn't invite her to the first one.

23
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,391
Well, in our defense,
it was kind of a spur-of-the-moment thing.

24
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,834
And also, we don't like her.

25
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,995
Leonard, come on, she's your mom.

26
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,912
If we can do something to make her happy,
why wouldn't we?

27
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:10,910
ljust said why. We don't like her.

28
00:01:11,679 --> 00:01:13,590
Okay, look, forget about her,
let's do it for us.

29
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,672
We can keep it small and informal,
and this time we can invite our families.

30
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,108
Is your brother out of prison?

31
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,599
Thanks to overcrowding, yeah.

32
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,115
I'd love it if my dad could come.

33
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,748
Oh! You have to invite him.
I haven't seen him since the divorce.

34
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,911
Oh, he is like a different man.

35
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:30,718
He stopped twitching,
and I think he grew an inch and a half.

36
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,434
Well, then it's settled.

37
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:34,714
Yay!

38
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,913
God, it's so funny, I never thought
my second marriage would be to you.

39
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:43,195
(THEME SONG PLAYING)

40
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,832
Okay, so, it's not a legal ceremony,

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,274
it's just a chance for us
to redo our vows

42
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,919
so everyone can be part of it.

43
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,279
So, there's no maid of honor?

44
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,197
-No.
-Hmm.

45
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:21,431
But if I were to, say,
wear a purple satin dress

46
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,397
with a sweetheart neckline
and stand near you,

47
00:02:23,559 --> 00:02:25,629
you wouldn't be able to stop me, right?

48
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,872
-I don't see howl could.
-(LAUGHS)

49
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:30,913
Then I graciously accept. (CHUCKLES)

50
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,034
Who's going to officiate?

51
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,633
l was kind of hoping you would.

52
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:38,228
Wait, now I'm just
some lousy maid of honor? What?

53
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,836
Hey, good news. ljust got off the phone
with my mother.

54
00:02:41,999 --> 00:02:43,034
She is coming to the wedding.

55
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,353
Okay, you're inviting people
to ourwedding?

56
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,080
Yes, I'm inviting people to ourwedding.

57
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:53,312
Yeah, I've already asked Stephen Hawking
and Robert Downey, Jr.,

58
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:56,471
and now, don't get your hopes up,
'cause he's pretty busy, but Erno Rubik.

59
00:02:58,279 --> 00:02:59,234
Who's Erno Rubik?

60
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,474
Seriously?

61
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,072
He invented the Rubik's Cube.

62
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,595
Okay, fine, but why would you invite him
to our wedding?

63
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,596
Because despite his fame and fortune,
he strikes me as a lonely man.

64
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,591
Well, it's very sweet of you
to go to all this trouble

65
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,795
for Leonard's mother.

66
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:16,994
You know, I'm also doing it for Leonard.

67
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,990
I think
this could really help their relationship.

68
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,232
How dare you invite your father
without consulting me?

69
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:26,629
I'm sorry,
but I don't think I need your permission

70
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,391
to have my father at my wedding.

71
00:03:28,559 --> 00:03:31,710
You do understand our marriage ended
because he had an affair.

72
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,434
I know, and there's no excuse for that.

73
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,518
He claimed l was cold, emasculating,

74
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,399
and hadn't shown him
any physical affection for years.

75
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,670
l was wrong,
there's three excuses for that.

76
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,875
Oh, my God, it's working.

77
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,792
-You sure?
-Look.

78
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,872
The system is maintaining
its own stability.

79
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,918
The quantum vortex apparatus
is now controlling the orientation.

80
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,917
You're right. You realize what this means?

81
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,474
Yeah.

82
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:11,754
I do.

83
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:14,394
lt's proof of concept.

84
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,193
We've got a workable guidance system.

85
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:20,074
Congratulations. (CHUCKLES)

86
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,832
-Thanks.
-(BOTH LAUGH)

87
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:24,594
(BEEPS)

88
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:28,237
Hey, ljust got an email
from the US Air Force.

89
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,835
Open it.

90
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,312
"We request a meeting
at your earliest convenience

91
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:39,473
"regarding your quantum guidance system,
provisional patent 62/295118."

92
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,395
That's weird.

93
00:04:42,719 --> 00:04:44,835
Is there a window around here
we don't know about?

94
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,398
No, I'm sure it's just a coincidence.

95
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,199
Yeah, of course, what else could it be?

96
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,078
Boy, do I love America!

97
00:04:57,359 --> 00:04:58,792
Thank you for picking me up.

98
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:00,233
Oh, you're welcome.

99
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:03,635
l was speaking to your young lady.

100
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:05,188
My pleasure, Mrs. Cooper.

101
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,469
Oh, please, call me Mary.

102
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,194
Okay, Mary.

103
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,589
You know, that doesn't work for me,
let's stay with "Mrs. Cooper."

104
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,434
Sheldon, don't be silly.

105
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:18,591
What? That's what I called you
until I got to know you better.

106
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,154
It was so nice of Leonard and Penny
to invite me.

107
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:24,877
-Well, actually--
-It sure was!

108
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:29,394
I've always had a special place
in my heart for Leonard,

109
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,993
taking care of my baby all these years.

110
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:33,669
Excuse me, I take care of him.

111
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,319
Sure you do.

112
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,035
So, who else is coming to this shindig?

113
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,317
Oh, well, the usual gang.
Penny's family's coming tomorrow.

114
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:43,832
Yeah, Leonard's mother's already here.

115
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,196
Oh, Beverly, how nice.

116
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:48,954
You've met her, right?

117
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,834
Yes, l have.

118
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,748
Mother, she's an atheist, not a vampire.

119
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,590
Either way,
let's stop and get some garlic.

120
00:06:13,359 --> 00:06:14,508
So, Mary, how have you been?

121
00:06:14,679 --> 00:06:16,909
Thank you so much for asking.
I've been well, and you?

122
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,148
-Very good.
-Good.

123
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:23,629
I don't know what we were worried about,
they're getting along great.

124
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:27,397
Sheldon tells me your husband's coming.

125
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,515
My ex-husband.

126
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,635
Oh, I'm so sorry.

127
00:06:29,799 --> 00:06:30,914
-Don't be.
-All right.

128
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,268
Ooh. Chilly.

129
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,589
I think I can see my breath.

130
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:36,754
We can hear you.

131
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:37,874
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

132
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,116
I can't believe I was so nai've.

133
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,034
The military is just gonna take over
the whole project.

134
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,430
And you know what happens if we object.

135
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:50,034
We disappear.

136
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,274
(HOWARD CHUCKLES)

137
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:52,514
Like, off the map!

138
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:54,397
Like every American Idol winner
since season four.

139
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,033
Come on, Howard, you're overreacting.

140
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,191
(YELLS) Am I?
(WHISPERS) Am I?

141
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,109
I mean, what do you wanna bet

142
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,999
some black-ops guy
is reprinting my high school yearbook,

143
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,275
and I'm no longer in it.

144
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,669
That chess club picture is nowjust
David Zimmerman and Elaine Cho.

145
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,477
Okay, look, I'm on the Air Force website,

146
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:21,273
and the department that emailed you
is in charge of acquisitions.

147
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:23,634
So, maybe they just wanna give you
a lot of money for your invention.

148
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,911
Oh, please, that's not how it works.

149
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:32,348
You saw E. T., Avatar, Jurassic World.
The militaryjust shows up and takes over.

150
00:07:32,999 --> 00:07:35,035
You do realize
those weren't documentaries, right?

151
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:37,394
(LAUGHS)

152
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,193
I'm sorry, you find this funny?

153
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,635
No, lwasjust thinking
about Jurassic World.

154
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:43,073
Boy, that was terrible.

155
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,075
Oh, we have to use the stairs.

156
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,834
When are they gonna fix your elevator?

157
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,592
I don't... Any day now.

158
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,315
Well, the stairs are fine.

159
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,871
ALFRED: Besides,
your mother's up there.

160
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,231
Maybe I'll have a heart attack
and not have to see her.

161
00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:12,916
Hey, I know things are a little rough
with you and Mom,

162
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:14,990
but I'm really glad you're here.

163
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:16,148
Me, too.

164
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,757
I should never have had that angioplasty,
because I feel fine.

165
00:08:26,679 --> 00:08:28,078
Penny's really looking forward
to seeing you.

166
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:29,951
Ah, she's a sweetie.

167
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,156
You got a good one there, Leonard.

168
00:08:32,319 --> 00:08:33,468
Thanks, Dad.

169
00:08:35,199 --> 00:08:36,393
How the hell did you do that?

170
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,075
(CRUNCHES)

171
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,595
(CRUNCHES)

172
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:01,588
Isn't this nice?

173
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,954
Hey, we're here.

174
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,429
-Alfred, thank you for coming!
-Oh!

175
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:09,232
-Well, happy to be here.
-Thanks.

176
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,515
-And congratulations.
-Thank you.

177
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,874
Dad, you remember Sheldon.

178
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,598
-Dr. Hofstadter.
-Dr. Cooper.

179
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,113
This is Sheldon's mother, Mary.

180
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,872
-How do you do?
-Nice to meet you.

181
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,189
And his girlfriend, Amy.

182
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,429
-A pleasure.
-Hi.

183
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,669
And of course, Mom.

184
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:22,352
Hello, my hateful shrew.

185
00:09:26,439 --> 00:09:28,509
Hello to you, you wrinkled old bastard.

186
00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:34,030
All right, now I'm starting to sense
a little tension.

187
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,471
All right, you two, don't start.

188
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:44,152
Penny and l
are throwing this second wedding

189
00:09:44,319 --> 00:09:45,308
for your benefit.

190
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,595
Can you please not ruin it?

191
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,278
Of course. I'm sorry.

192
00:09:48,439 --> 00:09:49,758
Look at that, you can apologize.

193
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:51,238
-Mom!
-l'm sorry.

194
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,633
You know, the Bible says forgiveness--

195
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:55,027
-Mom!
-l'm sorry.

196
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,717
Who's hungry? We have a reservation
at the best restaurant in town.

197
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:01,637
That only got
three and a half stars on Yelp.

198
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,313
-Sheldon.
-l'm not sorry, that's true.

199
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,596
I don't know what to do.
It's the Air Force.

200
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:11,559
I mean, should I respond to their email?
lgnore it?

201
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:12,994
You can't ignore it.

202
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,549
It's not that postcard that says
it's time to go back to the dentist.

203
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,153
Guys, come on,
we're meeting everyone for dinner.

204
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:23,073
One sec. I'm just afraid ifl respond,
then they'll know I got it.

205
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,879
Dude, the minute you opened that email,
they knew you got it.

206
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,190
I mean, they're probably looking at you
through the camera right now.

207
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,634
Damn.

208
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,429
I love America.

209
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,275
Are you done with this nonsense?

210
00:10:36,439 --> 00:10:39,556
It's not nonsense.
This is how the US military works.

211
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:40,868
If it's even the US military.

212
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,873
It could be foreign military
pretending to be American.

213
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,151
You're right. We turn our guidance system
over to them,

214
00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:48,037
next thing we know,
they're using it against us.

215
00:10:50,599 --> 00:10:52,829
I also love the enemies of America.

216
00:11:01,439 --> 00:11:05,591
Penny, I hope the example
of my failed marriage to Leonard's father

217
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,752
doesn't discourage you from the commitment
you've made to one another.

218
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,553
No, of course not.

219
00:11:12,319 --> 00:11:15,356
Although, Alfred and I had a lot more
going for us than you two.

220
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,108
Mom, please save something for the toast.

221
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,271
So, Alfred,
what is it that you do for a living?

222
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,637
Oh, I'm an anthropologist.
I study ancient peoples and cultures.

223
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,394
My goodness!
So, all the way back to the Flood.

224
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,192
(LAUGHS)

225
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:37,910
Don't laugh, she wasn'tjoking.

226
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,948
Play with your phone.

227
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,830
Well, on that note,
there are many cultures

228
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:49,752
that have an apocalyptic flood
as part of their mythology.

229
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:52,952
I don't have a mythology,
l have the unerring word of God.

230
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,111
-But that's very interesting.
-Oh!

231
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:59,155
I didn't mean to disparage your faith.
Actually, I admire it.

232
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,435
-Really?
-Yes.

233
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,999
I'm an agnostic, myself,

234
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,280
but I have prayed many times to God
to turn my wife into a pillar of salt.

235
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,512
Well, he came close. He turned her
into a giant block of ice.

236
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:13,795
(BOTH LAUGHING)

237
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,274
Howard, there must be someone
at the university you can go to for help.

238
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,995
Are you kidding?

239
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,993
They're probably the ones who leaked it
to the military in the first place.

240
00:12:25,319 --> 00:12:28,117
What about the guy on the Channel 4 news?

241
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,596
You know? "Four on your side."
Maybe he can be on your side.

242
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,592
I'm being harassed by the government.

243
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,115
I'm not trying to get to
the bottom of a dog-walking scam.

244
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:41,791
Ugh. Stop.

245
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:43,278
You know what's really happening?

246
00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:45,794
All the movies you've watched,
the TV shows, the comic books,

247
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,712
they've completely twisted your thinking.

248
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:49,153
No one's after you,
no one's listening to you,

249
00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:50,638
no one cares about you.

250
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,275
I'd like to think

251
00:12:54,439 --> 00:12:56,077
the "Four on your side" guy
cares about me.

252
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,238
You know, Beverly, I know you and Alfred
have your differences.

253
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,197
But if you think about it,
if you hadn't married him,

254
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,839
-there'd be no Leonard.
-(CHUCKLES)

255
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,473
So, that's good, right?

256
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,109
Yeah.

257
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,709
(SIGHING)

258
00:13:15,999 --> 00:13:17,751
Is that Howard in front of us?

259
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,151
Oh, maybe. Hey, get closer.

260
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,472
God, I think someone's following us.

261
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:28,628
You're being ridiculous.

262
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,030
I'm not being ridiculous. He's right
on my tail. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

263
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,708
Turn left here
and see if he turns with us.

264
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,629
Oh! Why is he turning here?
The restaurant's the other way.

265
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,792
I don't know. He uses that traffic app,
maybe there's an accident.

266
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,398
Oh! So follow him.

267
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,393
Oh, no!

268
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,909
I told you.

269
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,993
lt's probablyjust a coincidence.

270
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,238
Speed up a little,
see if he stays with you.

271
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,992
Well, go faster, you're losing him.

272
00:13:58,159 --> 00:13:59,194
What is his hurry?

273
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,873
You know what? Flash your lights,
let him know it's you.

274
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,630
He's flashing his lights.
What's that mean?

275
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,517
I think he wants us to pull over.

276
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,114
Do not pull over!
I'm not raising this baby alone!

277
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,229
Hang on!

278
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,358
So, after your husband passed,
you never remarried?

279
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,273
No. Just focused on work and the church.

280
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:23,878
Ah! And what do you do?

281
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,075
| work at the church.

282
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,915
Well, they're lucky to have you.

283
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,475
Well, thank you.

284
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:32,674
You're welcome.

285
00:14:33,359 --> 00:14:34,838
Do you realize what's happening here?

286
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,469
Yeah, I do.

287
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,636
They're filling up on bread
and ruining their meal.

288
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:44,349
-Hey.
-Hey, what took you guys so long?

289
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,669
We were following Howard,
but for some reason

290
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,274
he turned off his headlights
and went up a one-way street.

291
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,275
So, what did we miss?

292
00:14:52,439 --> 00:14:54,509
Oh, just Mary and |
getting to know each other a little.

293
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,438
Leonard, your father's just charming.

294
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:58,511
He's also broke. Did he mention that?

295
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,790
Okay, Mom, you sit over there.

296
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,756
You know, I'm gonna call Bernadette
and see what's keeping them.

297
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,717
Well, if I'd known you were broke,

298
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:12,835
I wouldn't have made a big deal
about the bread.

299
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:19,194
Hey, Penny.

300
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,549
What are you talking about?

301
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,919
Oh, that was you?

302
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,195
(CHUCKLES)

303
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,790
Long story.
Why don't you go ahead and eat?

304
00:15:29,999 --> 00:15:31,114
We're gonna be a while.

305
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:38,749
I'm telling ya, I'm not on drugs.
The government's out to get me!

306
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,715
Now, one of the more exciting things
we found recently

307
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:50,191
is that Neanderthals and Homo Sapiens
frequently mated with each other.

308
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,552
Well, that certainly explains
my marriage to Sheldon's father.

309
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,795
(LAUGHING)

310
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,709
That's funny because my father
was not a very clever man.

311
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:02,073
I'd be lost without you.

312
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,715
(CLINKING)

313
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,708
I would like to propose a toast
to my wife and bride-to-be.

314
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,036
-Now, see, that's funny because--
-Back to your phone.

315
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:16,034
Penny,

316
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,512
I've always known I loved you.

317
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:23,151
But this last year has shown me
that I also love being married to you.

318
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:25,393
Thank you for saying yes.

319
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,632
Thanks for asking until I did.

320
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:31,515
-Hear, hear.
-Cheers.

321
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,796
I would also like to make a toast.

322
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,995
Aww.

323
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,756
Leonard, I am so happy
that you have found a woman

324
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,114
who loves and cares for you.

325
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,872
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

326
00:16:46,999 --> 00:16:47,988
Why don't you take a pill?

327
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,513
Like you did before sex?

328
00:16:50,999 --> 00:16:52,796
What I really needed was a blindfold.

329
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,713
All right, everyone, calm down.

330
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:57,949
Let's all remember
what it says in the Bible,

331
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,351
"He who is slow to anger
is better than the mighty."

332
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,637
Oh, dear woman,
can you please read another book?

333
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,229
When God writes one, lwill.

334
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,634
(CLEARS THROAT)

335
00:17:15,239 --> 00:17:16,194
Um...

336
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:19,989
If we wanna order the soufflé,
we might wanna get on that.

337
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,315
Leonard, if you don't mind,
I think I'm a little tired.

338
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,192
I'm gonna call it a night.

339
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,749
-Sure, Dad.
-l'm a little tuckered out myself.

340
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,592
I will see you all in the morning.

341
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,191
-Would you like to share a cab?
-That would be fine.

342
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,918
-Where you staying?
-l'm at the Westin.

343
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:40,388
Well, so am I.
Could I interest you in a nightcap?

344
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,753
I think that you could.

345
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:48,833
What is happening there?

346
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:51,312
I think it's pretty obvious.

347
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,830
They don't want dessert
'cause they filled up on bread.

348
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,753
She's still not answering.

349
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,432
My father's not texting me back.

350
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,353
'Cause they both turned their phones off.

351
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:19,313
I don't like this at all.

352
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,108
I don't like it, either.

353
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:23,268
Really?

354
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,158
(LAUGHS) Because I love it.

355
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:29,191
(LAUGHING)

356
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,275
