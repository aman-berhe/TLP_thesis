1
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,390
I should've known that you would
be here. Professor McGonagall.

2
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,197
Good evening. Professor Dumbledore.

3
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,478
Are the rumors true. Albus?

4
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:47,713
I'm afraid so. professor.
The good and the bad.

5
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,037
-And the boy?
-Hagrid is bringing him.

6
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,034
Is it wise to trust Hagrid
with something so important?

7
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:00,229
Professor. I would trust Hagrid
with my life.

8
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,279
Professor Dumbledore. sir.
Professor McGonagall.

9
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,189
-No problems. I trust. Hagrid?
-No. sir.

10
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,678
Little tyke fell asleep
as we were flying over Bristol.

11
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,829
Try not to wake him.

12
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,591
There you go.

13
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,157
Do you really think it's safe.
leaving him with these people?

14
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,388
I've watched them all day.
They're the worst sort of Muggles.

15
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:55,427
-They really are--
-The only family he has.

16
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,390
He'll be famous. Every child
in our world will know his name.

17
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:02,277
Exactly.

18
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,598
He's far better off growing up
away from all of that.

19
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,599
Until he's ready.

20
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,399
There. there. Hagrid.
It's not really goodbye. after all.

21
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,193
Good luck...

22
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,229
...Harry Potter.

23
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,958
Up. Get up!

24
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,913
Now!

25
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:24,270
Wake up. cousin!
We're going to the zoo!

26
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,074
-Here he comes. the birthday boy.
-Happy birthday. son.

27
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,877
Cook breakfast.
And try not to burn anything.

28
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:49,834
-Yes. Aunt Petunia.
-I want everything to be perfect...

29
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,837
...for my Dudley's special day!

30
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:57,829
-Hurry up! Bring my coffee. boy.
-Yes. Uncle Vernon.

31
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,992
Aren't they wonderful. darling?

32
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:07,435
-How many are there?
-36. Counted them myself.

33
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,712
36?! But last year I had 37!

34
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,629
-But some are bigger than last year's.
-I don't care!

35
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,229
This is what we're going to do.

36
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,638
We're going to buy you two
new presents. How's that. pumpkin?

37
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:28,912
It should be a lovely day at the zoo.
I'm really looking forward to it.

38
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,832
l'm warning you now. boy.

39
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:37,395
Any funny business. any at all...

40
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:40,511
...and you won't have
any meals for a week.

41
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,912
Get in.

42
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,109
Make it move.

43
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:56,317
Move!

44
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,915
-Move!
-He's asleep!

45
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,554
He's boring.

46
00:06:03,879 --> 00:06:05,278
Sorry about him.

47
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:09,028
He doesn't understand
what it's like. lying there...

48
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:13,228
...watching people press
their ugly faces in on you.

49
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,440
Can you hear me?

50
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,719
It's just. I've never talked
to a snake before.

51
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,513
Do you...?

52
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,679
Do you talk to people often?

53
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,911
You're from Burma. aren't you?
Was it nice there?

54
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,315
Do you miss your family?

55
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:44,595
| see. That's me as well.
I never knew my parents either.

56
00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:49,589
Mummy. Dad. you won't believe
what this snake is doing!

57
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,671
Thanks.

58
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,233
Anytime.

59
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,271
Snake!

60
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,317
Mum! Mummy! Help me!

61
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,552
My darling boy!
How did you get in there?

62
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,909
Who did this? How did you get
in there? Is there a snake?

63
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:56,674
It's all right. sweetheart.
We'll get you out of these cold clothes.

64
00:07:58,359 --> 00:08:01,157
-What happened?
-I swear. I don't know!

65
00:08:01,359 --> 00:08:05,068
The glass was there
and then it was gone. like magic.

66
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,993
There's no such thing as magic.

67
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,840
Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.

68
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,112
-Dad. look! Harry's got a letter!
-|t's mine!

69
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,959
Yours? Who'd be writing to you?

70
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:30,316
No more mail through this letterbox.

71
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:44,718
Have a lovely day at the office. dear.

72
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,040
Shoo! Go on.

73
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,632
Fine day. Sunday.

74
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,711
In my opinion. best day of the week.
Why is that. Dudley?

75
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,152
-Because there's no post on Sundays?
-Right you are. Harry!

76
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,999
No post on Sunday.

77
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,114
No blasted letters today! No. sir.

78
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:39,435
Not one single bloody letter. Not one!

79
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,229
No. sir. not one blasted. miserable--

80
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,396
Make it stop. please!

81
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,951
Stop it!

82
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,753
Mummy. what's happening?

83
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:22,191
Give me that! Give me that letter!

84
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,392
Get off!

85
00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:33,992
They're my letters! Let go of me!

86
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,678
That's it! We're going away!

87
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,835
Far away. where they can't find us!

88
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:45,156
Daddy's gone mad. hasn't he?

89
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,834
Make a wish. Harry.

90
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,236
Who's there?

91
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,229
Sorry about that.

92
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:03,230
I demand that you leave at once.
You are breaking and entering.

93
00:13:05,999 --> 00:13:08,718
Dry up. Dursley. you great prune.

94
00:13:13,719 --> 00:13:17,075
I haven't seen you
since you was a baby. Harry.

95
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,637
You're a bit more along than I expected.
Particularly in the middle.

96
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,559
I'm not Harry.

97
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:29,868
-I am.
-Well. of course you are.

98
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,152
Got something for you.

99
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,718
Afraid | sat on it. but I imagine
it'll taste fine just the same.

100
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,396
Baked it myself. words and all.

101
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,709
Thank you.

102
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:53,918
It's not every day your young man
turns 11. is it?

103
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,439
Excuse me. but who are you?

104
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,349
Rubeus Hagrid. Keeper of Keys
and Grounds at Hogwarts.

105
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,149
-Of course. you know about Hogwarts.
-Sorry. no.

106
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,430
Didn't you ever wonder where
your mum and dad learned it all?

107
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,999
Learned what?

108
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,634
You're a wizard. Harry.

109
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,756
-|'m a what?
-A wizard.

110
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,872
A good one. I'd wager.
once you're trained up.

111
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,873
No. you've made a mistake.
I mean...

112
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,958
...I can't be a wizard.

113
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:48,150
I mean. I'm just Harry. Just Harry.

114
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,034
Well. Just Harry. did you ever
make anything happen?

115
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,711
Anything you couldn't explain.
when you were angry or scared?

116
00:15:13,439 --> 00:15:16,431
IIDear Mr. Potter.
We are pleased to accept you...

117
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,756
...at Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry.II

118
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:24,714
He will not be going! We swore
we'd put a stop to all this rubbish.

119
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,959
You knew? You knew all along
and you never told me?

120
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,118
Of course we knew.
How could you not be?

121
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:35,868
My perfect sister being who she was.

122
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:41,790
My mother and father were so proud
the day she got her letter.

123
00:15:41,999 --> 00:15:45,992
IIWe have a witch in the family.
Isn't it wonderful?II

124
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,715
l was the only one to see her
for what she was.

125
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,592
A freak!

126
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,633
Then she met that Potter.
and then she had you...

127
00:15:54,839 --> 00:16:00,311
...and I knew you would be the same.
Just as strange. just as abnormal.

128
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:05,309
And then she got herself blown up.
and we got landed with you.

129
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:09,354
Blown up? You told me
my parents died in a car crash.

130
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,718
A car crash? A car crash killed
Lily and James Potter?

131
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,674
-We had to say something.
-|t's an outrage! A scandal!

132
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:20,234
He'll not be going.

133
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:23,636
A great Muggle like you
is going to stop him?

134
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:24,788
Muggle?

135
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,954
Non-magic folk. This boy's had
his name down since he were born.

136
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,869
He's going to the finest school
of witchcraft and wizardry.

137
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:38,756
He'll be under the finest headmaster
Hogwarts has seen. Albus Dumbledore.

138
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:43,555
I will not pay to have a crackpot
old fool teach him magic tricks.

139
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,116
Never insult Albus Dumbledore...

140
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:50,275
...in front of me.

141
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,467
I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell
anyone at Hogwarts about that.

142
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,633
-|'m not allowed to do magic.
-Okay.

143
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,758
We're a bit behind schedule.
Best be off.

144
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,752
Unless you'd rather stay. of course.

145
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,630
IIAll students must be equipped with...

146
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:49,637
...one standard size 2
pewter cauldron...

147
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:55,391
...and may bring. if they desire.
either an owl. a cat or a toad.II

148
00:17:55,639 --> 00:17:58,107
Can we find all this in London?

149
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,595
If you know where to go.

150
00:18:22,439 --> 00:18:25,272
Ah. Hagrid! The usual. I presume?

151
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:29,188
No. thanks. Tom.
I'm on official Hogwarts business.

152
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,358
Just helping Harry buy
his school supplies.

153
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,990
Bless my soul.
lt's Harry Potter!

154
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,430
Welcome back. Mr. Potter.
Welcome back.

155
00:18:43,639 --> 00:18:47,791
Doris Crockford. I can't believe
I'm meeting you at last.

156
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,268
Harry Potter. Can't tell you
how pleased I am to meet you.

157
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:55,913
Hello. professor. I didn't see you.

158
00:18:56,119 --> 00:19:00,909
Professor Quirrell will be your
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

159
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,429
Oh. nice to meet you.

160
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,637
Fearfully fascinating subject.

161
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:11,277
Not that you need it. eh. Potter?

162
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:16,152
Yes. well. must be going now.
Lots to buy.

163
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:18,031
Goodbye.

164
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,076
-See. Harry? You're famous.
-But why am | famous?

165
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:27,589
All those people.
how is it they know who I am?

166
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,429
I'm not sure I'm the right person
to tell you that.

167
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,355
Welcome. Harry. to Diagon Alley.

168
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,428
Here. you get your quills and ink.

169
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,433
Over there. all your bits and bobs
for doing wizardry.

170
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:39,429
It's a world-class racing broom.

171
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,349
Look at it! The new Nimbus 2000!

172
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:46,750
It's the fastest model yet.

173
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:54,710
But how am | to pay for all this?
I haven't any money.

174
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,151
There's your money.
Gringotts. the wizard bank.

175
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:03,639
Ain't no safer place. not one.
Except perhaps Hogwarts.

176
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,594
Hagrid. what exactly
are these things?

177
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:24,827
They're goblins. Clever as they come.
but not the most friendly of beasts.

178
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,916
Best stay close.

179
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,314
Mr. Harry Potter wishes
to make a withdrawal.

180
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:41,396
And does Mr. Harry Potter
have his key?

181
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,392
Wait a minute.
Got it here somewhere.

182
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,839
Ha! There's the little devil.

183
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,792
And there's something else as well.

184
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,197
Professor Dumbledore gave me this.

185
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:06,948
It's about You-Know-What
in vault you-know-which.

186
00:22:08,199 --> 00:22:10,076
Very well.

187
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:17,798
Vault 687.

188
00:22:19,639 --> 00:22:21,834
Lamp. please.

189
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,274
Key. please.

190
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,355
Did you think your parents
would leave you with nothing?

191
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:02,148
-Vault 713.
-What's in there. Hagrid?

192
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:06,352
Can't tell you.
Hogwarts business. Very secret.

193
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,079
Stand back.

194
00:23:35,199 --> 00:23:37,872
Best not to mention this to anyone.

195
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:49,713
I still need a wand.

196
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,195
You want Ollivanders.
There ain't no place better.

197
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,795
Run along there and wait.
I got one more thing to do.

198
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:17,791
Hello?

199
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,392
Hello?

200
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,878
I wondered when
I'd be seeing you. Mr. Potter.

201
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:39,475
It seems only yesterday...

202
00:24:39,719 --> 00:24:45,316
...that your mother and father were
in here buying their first wands.

203
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,915
Here we are.

204
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,593
Give it a wave.

205
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,233
Apparently not.

206
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,476
Perhaps...

207
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,150
...this.

208
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:37,356
No. no. definitely not.
No matter.

209
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,837
I wonder....

210
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,035
Curious.

211
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,038
Very curious.

212
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,232
Sorry. but what's curious?

213
00:26:23,879 --> 00:26:27,030
I remember every wand
I've ever sold. Mr. Potter.

214
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,879
It so happens that the phoenix...

215
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,596
...whose tail feather resides
in your wand. gave another feather.

216
00:26:34,999 --> 00:26:37,957
Just one other.

217
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,311
It is curious that you should
be destined for this wand...

218
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:47,998
...when its brother
gave you that scar.

219
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:52,831
And who owned that wand?

220
00:26:53,639 --> 00:26:55,948
We do not speak his name.

221
00:26:56,399 --> 00:26:59,755
The wand chooses
the wizard. Mr. Potter.

222
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,838
It's not always clear why.

223
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,556
But I think it is clear...

224
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:10,513
...that we can expect
great things from you.

225
00:27:10,719 --> 00:27:14,792
After all. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named . ..

226
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,600
...did great things.

227
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:19,710
Terrible...

228
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,276
...yes. but great.

229
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:30,635
Harry! Harry!

230
00:27:30,999 --> 00:27:33,274
Happy birthday.

231
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:43,475
You all right. Harry?
You seem very quiet.

232
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:49,198
He killed my parents. didn't he?
The one who gave me this.

233
00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:52,869
You know. Hagrid. I know you do.

234
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,957
First. and understand this
because it's very important:

235
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:03,593
Not all wizards are good.

236
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:06,188
Some of them go bad.
A few years ago...

237
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:11,190
...there was a wizard who went as bad
as you can go. His name was V--

238
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:14,869
-His name was V--
-Maybe if you wrote it down?

239
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,877
No. I can't spell it.

240
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:21,153
-All right. Voldemort.
-Vo|demort?

241
00:28:24,959 --> 00:28:27,109
It was dark times. Harry.

242
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,312
Voldemort started
to gather some followers.

243
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,757
Brought them over to the Dark Side.

244
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:40,071
Anyone that stood up to him
ended up dead.

245
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:44,071
Your parents fought against him.

246
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:47,908
But nobody lived once
he decided to kill them.

247
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:54,587
Nobody, not one.

248
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,074
Except you.

249
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:02,958
Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?

250
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:07,393
Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut
on your forehead. Harry.

251
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:13,197
A mark like that only comes from being
touched by a curse. an evil curse.

252
00:29:13,399 --> 00:29:16,869
What happened to V--?
To You-Know-Who?

253
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,191
Well. some say he died.

254
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,709
Codswallop. in my opinion.

255
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,037
Nope. I reckon he's out there still...

256
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,073
...too tired to carry on.

257
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:35,479
But one thing's certain. Something
about you stumped him that night.

258
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,793
That's why you're famous.
That's why everybody knows your name.

259
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,755
You're the boy who lived.

260
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,314
What are you looking at?

261
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,911
Blimey. is that the time?

262
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:02,953
I'm gonna have to leave you.
Dumbledore will be wanting his--

263
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:07,836
Well. he'll be wanting to see me.
Your train leaves in 10 minutes.

264
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:13,159
Here's your ticket. Stick to your ticket.
that's very important.

265
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,069
IIPlatform 9 3I4"?

266
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:22,876
But. Hagrid. there must be a mistake.
This says platform 9 3I4.

267
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,277
There's no such thing. is there?

268
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:45,552
Sorry.

269
00:30:46,999 --> 00:30:49,638
Excuse me. Excuse me.

270
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,319
On your left.

271
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:55,188
Can you tell me where
I might find platform 9 3I4?

272
00:30:55,399 --> 00:30:57,833
Think you're being funny. do you?

273
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:01,236
It's the same every year.
packed with Muggles.

274
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,910
-Mugg|es?
-Platform 9 3I4. this way.

275
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,397
All right. Percy. you first.

276
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,109
Fred. you next.

277
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,869
-He's not Fred. I am.
-You call yourself our mother?

278
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:29,956
I'm sorry. George.

279
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,228
I'm only joking. lam Fred.

280
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,268
Excuse me.

281
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,993
Could you tell me how to...?

282
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,590
How to get onto the platform?
Not to worry. dear.

283
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:54,154
lt's Ron's first time
to Hogwarts as well.

284
00:31:54,360 --> 00:32:00,037
All you do is walk straight at the wall
between platforms 9 and 10.

285
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,550
-Best to run if you're nervous.
-Good luck.

286
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:02,872
Excuse me. Do you mind?
Everywhere else is full.

287
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,196
Not at all.

288
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,468
l'm Ron. by the way.
Ron Weasley.

289
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,234
l'm Harry. Harry Potter.

290
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,516
So it's true!

291
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,393
I mean. do you really have the...?

292
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,713
-The what?
-The scar?

293
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:27,875
Wicked!

294
00:33:30,239 --> 00:33:35,188
-Anything off the trolley. dears?
-No. thanks. I'm all set.

295
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,275
We'll take the lot.

296
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:56,155
-Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans?
-They mean every flavor.

297
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,791
There's chocolate
and peppermint and also...

298
00:33:59,999 --> 00:34:03,674
...spinach. liver and tripe.

299
00:34:03,879 --> 00:34:07,872
George sweared he got
a booger-flavored one once.

300
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:17,480
-Are they real frogs?
-|t's a spell. You want the cards.

301
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:22,913
Each pack's got a famous witch
or wizard. I've got about 500 meself.

302
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,555
Watch it!

303
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,109
That's rotten luck. They've only
got one good jump in them.

304
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,634
-|'ve got Dumbledore!
-I got about six of him.

305
00:34:40,319 --> 00:34:41,798
Hey. he's gone!

306
00:34:41,999 --> 00:34:45,309
You can't expect him to
hang around all day. can you?

307
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,912
This is Scabbers.
Pathetic. isn't he?

308
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,235
A little.

309
00:34:50,439 --> 00:34:53,636
Fred gave me a spell
to turn him yellow. Want to see?

310
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,795
Yeah.

311
00:35:02,279 --> 00:35:03,837
Has anyone seen a toad?

312
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:06,759
-A boy named Neville's lost one.
-No.

313
00:35:07,319 --> 00:35:11,471
Oh. are you doing magic?
Let's see. then.

314
00:35:12,479 --> 00:35:16,631
Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow

315
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,838
Turn this stupid, lat rat yellow

316
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,873
Are you sure that's a real spell?
Well. it's not very good. is it?

317
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,196
I've only tried
a few simple ones myself...

318
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,914
...but they've all worked for me.

319
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,356
For example:

320
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:42,392
Oculus Reparo.

321
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,914
That's better. isn't it?

322
00:35:48,039 --> 00:35:51,793
Holy cricket. you're Harry Potter!

323
00:35:51,999 --> 00:35:55,435
l'm Hermione Granger.
And you are...?

324
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,192
-|'m Ron Weasley.
-P|easure.

325
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:04,269
You two better change into robes.
I expect we'll be arriving soon.

326
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:11,549
You've got dirt on your nose.
Did you know?

327
00:36:11,759 --> 00:36:13,636
Just there.

328
00:36:25,479 --> 00:36:29,108
Right. then.
First years. this way. please!

329
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:34,313
Come on. first years. don't be shy.
Come on now. hurry up.

330
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,873
-Hello. Harry.
-Hi. Hagrid.

331
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:49,072
Right. then. This way to the boats.
Come on now. follow me.

332
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,638
Wicked.

333
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:03,789
Welcome to Hogwarts.

334
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,834
Shortly. you'll pass through
these doors and join your classmates.

335
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:12,874
But before you take your seats.
you must be sorted into your houses.

336
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:16,072
They are Gryffindor. Hufflepuff...

337
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:20,558
...Ravenclaw and Slytherin.

338
00:38:20,959 --> 00:38:25,794
While you're here. your house
will be like your family.

339
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,756
Your triumphs will earn you points.

340
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:33,918
Any rule-breaking
and you will lose points.

341
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:39,194
At the end of the year. the house
with the most points wins the house cup.

342
00:38:39,439 --> 00:38:40,667
Trevor!

343
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:50,797
Sorry.

344
00:38:50,999 --> 00:38:54,787
The Sorting Ceremony
will begin momentarily.

345
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:59,277
It's true then.
what they're saying on the train.

346
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,194
Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.

347
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,753
Harry Potter?

348
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,920
This is Crabbe and Goyle.

349
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,315
And I'm Malfoy.

350
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:11,869
Draco Malfoy.

351
00:39:13,759 --> 00:39:17,195
Think my name's funny. do you?
I've no need to ask yours.

352
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:22,952
Red hair and a hand-me-down robe?
You must be a Weasley.

353
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:27,719
You'll find out some wizarding families
are better than others.

354
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,549
You don't want to go making friends
with the wrong sort.

355
00:39:31,759 --> 00:39:33,829
I can help you there.

356
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:39,634
I think I can tell the wrong sort
for myself. thanks.

357
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,156
We're ready for you now.
Follow me.

358
00:40:04,999 --> 00:40:09,311
The ceiling isn't real. lt's bewitched
to look like the night sky.

359
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,393
| read about it
in Hogwarts, A History.

360
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,838
Will you wait along here. please?

361
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:31,872
Now. before we begin...

362
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:35,197
...Professor Dumbledore would like
to say a few words.

363
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,996
l have a few start-of-term notices
| wish to announce.

364
00:40:40,359 --> 00:40:42,395
The first years. please note...

365
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:48,437
...that the Dark Forest is
strictly forbidden to all students.

366
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:53,959
Also. our caretaker. Mr. Filch.
has asked me to remind you...

367
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,597
...that the third-floor corridor
is out of bounds...

368
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,919
...to everyone who does not wish
to die a most painful death.

369
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:06,116
Thank you.

370
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,713
When I call your name.
you will come forth.

371
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,390
I shall place the Sorting Hat
on your head...

372
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,672
...and you will be sorted
into your houses.

373
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,394
Hermione Granger.

374
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:26,073
Oh. no. Okay. relax.

375
00:41:26,439 --> 00:41:29,670
Mental. that one. I'm telling you.

376
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:38,629
Right. then. Right.

377
00:41:38,839 --> 00:41:42,275
Okay. Gryffindor!

378
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:53,392
Draco Malfoy.

379
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:59,875
Slytherin!

380
00:42:00,799 --> 00:42:03,597
Every wizard who went bad
was in Slytherin.

381
00:42:03,799 --> 00:42:06,233
Susan Bones.

382
00:42:14,439 --> 00:42:16,475
Harry. what is it?

383
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:19,313
Nothing. Nothing. I'm fine.

384
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:20,912
Let's see....

385
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:25,312
I know! Hufflepuff!

386
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,309
Ronald Weasley.

387
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:47,390
Another Weasley!
I know just what to do with you.

388
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:50,275
Gryffindor!

389
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:58,628
Harry Potter.

390
00:43:15,959 --> 00:43:18,837
Difficult. very difficult.

391
00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:22,827
Plenty of courage. | see.
Not a bad mind. either.

392
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,235
There's talent. oh. yes.

393
00:43:25,439 --> 00:43:29,114
And a thirst to prove yourself.

394
00:43:29,319 --> 00:43:31,389
But where to put you?

395
00:43:31,959 --> 00:43:34,348
Not Slytherin. not Slytherin!

396
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:38,069
Not Slytherin. eh? Are you sure?

397
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:42,956
You could be great. you know.
It's all here. in your head.

398
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:48,280
And Slytherin will help you on the way
to greatness. no doubt about that.

399
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:53,037
No? Well. if you're sure.

400
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:54,911
Better be...

401
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:56,996
...Gryffindor!

402
00:44:21,479 --> 00:44:24,152
Your attention. please.

403
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:28,714
Let the feast begin.

404
00:44:44,959 --> 00:44:46,438
l'm half and half.

405
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,757
Me dad's a Muggle. Mum's a witch.

406
00:44:49,959 --> 00:44:53,315
Bit of a nasty shock for him
when he found out.

407
00:44:54,279 --> 00:44:57,908
Percy. who's that teacher
talking to Professor Ouirrell?

408
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:01,231
Professor Snape.
head of Slytherin house.

409
00:45:01,439 --> 00:45:03,270
-What's he teach?
-Potions.

410
00:45:03,479 --> 00:45:08,837
But he fancies the Dark Arts.
He's been after Ouirrell's job for years.

411
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,390
Hello! How are you?

412
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,871
Welcome to Gryffindor.

413
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,948
It's the Bloody Baron!

414
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,073
Hello. Sir Nicholas.
Have a nice summer?

415
00:45:38,279 --> 00:45:43,478
Dismal. Once again. my request to join
the Headless Hunt has been denied.

416
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,198
I know you.
You're Nearly Headless Nick.

417
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,039
I prefer Sir Nicholas.
if you don't mind.

418
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:55,595
IINearlyII headless?
How can you be nearly headless?

419
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,797
Like this.

420
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:11,075
Gryffindors. follow me. please.
Keep up. Thank you.

421
00:46:11,279 --> 00:46:15,431
Ravenclaw. follow me. This way.

422
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,877
This is the most direct path
to the dormitories.

423
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:23,072
Keep an eye on the staircases.
They like to change.

424
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:37,392
Keep up. please. and follow me.
Ouickly now. come on. Come on.

425
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:40,159
That picture's moving.

426
00:46:40,359 --> 00:46:43,715
-Look at that one.
-I think she fancies you.

427
00:46:45,399 --> 00:46:47,629
-Look!
-Who's that girl?

428
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,274
Welcome to Hogwarts.

429
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,153
Password?

430
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:10,272
Caput Draconis.

431
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:21,436
Follow me. everyone. Keep up.
Ouickly. come on.

432
00:47:24,039 --> 00:47:26,348
Gather around here.

433
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:31,150
Welcome to the Gryffindor common room.

434
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:35,591
Boys' dormitory is upstairs to the left.
Girls. the same on your right.

435
00:47:35,799 --> 00:47:38,791
Your belongings have
already been brought up.

436
00:48:44,199 --> 00:48:45,757
Made it!

437
00:48:45,959 --> 00:48:50,191
Can you imagine the look on old
McGonagall's face if we were late?

438
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:58,075
-That was bloody brilliant!
-Thank you for that assessment.

439
00:48:58,279 --> 00:49:02,397
It'd be better if I transfigured
Mr. Potter and you into a watch.

440
00:49:02,599 --> 00:49:05,671
-Then one of you might be on time.
-We got lost.

441
00:49:05,879 --> 00:49:11,397
Then perhaps a map? I trust you
don't need one to find your seats.

442
00:49:19,239 --> 00:49:24,677
There will be no foolish wand-waving
or silly incantations in this class.

443
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,350
As such. I don't expect
many of you to appreciate...

444
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:32,149
...the subtle science and exact art
that is potion-making.

445
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:35,318
However. for those select few...

446
00:49:36,199 --> 00:49:39,396
...who possess the predisposition...

447
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:46,071
...I can teach you
how to bewitch the mind...

448
00:49:46,279 --> 00:49:49,077
...and ensnare the senses.

449
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,714
I can tell you how to bottle fame...

450
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:57,597
...brew glory and even
put a stopper in death.

451
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:06,156
Then again. maybe some of you have
come to Hogwarts with abilities...

452
00:50:06,359 --> 00:50:12,070
...so formidable that
you feel confident enough...

453
00:50:12,279 --> 00:50:15,112
...to not pay attention.

454
00:50:20,839 --> 00:50:23,307
Mr. Potter.

455
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:28,154
Our new celebrity.

456
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:35,791
What would I get if I added root
of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?

457
00:50:38,919 --> 00:50:41,228
You don't know? Let's try again.

458
00:50:41,439 --> 00:50:45,876
Where would you look
if I asked you to find a bezoar?

459
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,439
I don't know. sir.

460
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:52,394
What is the difference
between monkshood and wolfsbane?

461
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,990
I don't know. sir.

462
00:50:58,039 --> 00:50:59,267
Pity.

463
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:04,959
Clearly. fame isn't everything...

464
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,353
...is it. Mr. Potter?

465
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:15,833
Eye of rabbit, harp string hum
Turn this water into rum

466
00:51:16,999 --> 00:51:18,478
Eye of rabbit....

467
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,360
What's Seamus trying to do
to the water?

468
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:26,116
Turn it to rum. Actually managed
a weak tea yesterday. before--

469
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:34,391
Mail's here.

470
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:08,193
Can I borrow this? Thanks.

471
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,076
Look. Neville's got a Remembrall.

472
00:52:14,279 --> 00:52:19,558
I've read about those. The smoke turns
red when you've forgotten something.

473
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:23,117
The problem is. I can't remember
what I've forgotten.

474
00:52:23,399 --> 00:52:26,675
Somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen.

475
00:52:26,879 --> 00:52:30,394
IIBelieved to be the work
of Dark wizards or witches...

476
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:36,112
...Gringotts goblins acknowledge
the breach but insist nothing was taken.

477
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:41,792
The vault in question. number 713.
had been emptied earlier that same day.II

478
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,073
That's odd. That's the vault
Hagrid and I went to.

479
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:58,235
-Good afternoon. class.
-Good afternoon. Madam Hooch.

480
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:01,113
Good afternoon. Amanda.
Good afternoon.

481
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:04,715
Welcome to your first flying lesson.

482
00:53:04,919 --> 00:53:08,673
What are you waiting for?
Step up to your broomstick.

483
00:53:08,879 --> 00:53:14,237
Come on now. hurry up. Stick your hand
over the broom and say. IIUp.II

484
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,317
Up!

485
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,470
Up.

486
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,672
Up.

487
00:53:22,279 --> 00:53:23,837
Up. Up!

488
00:53:24,039 --> 00:53:25,950
With feeling.

489
00:53:34,279 --> 00:53:36,315
Shut up. Harry.

490
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:40,997
Now. once you've got hold of
your broom. I want you to mount it.

491
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:45,033
Grip it tight. You don't wanna be
sliding off the end.

492
00:53:45,399 --> 00:53:50,154
When I blow my whistle. I want you
to kick off from the ground. hard.

493
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:54,035
Keep your broom steady.
hover for a moment...

494
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:58,357
...then lean forward slightly
and touch back down.

495
00:53:58,599 --> 00:54:01,591
On my whistle. Three. two....

496
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:05,239
Mr. Longbottom.

497
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,433
-Mr. Longbottom!
-Down. down!

498
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:13,834
Neville!

499
00:54:17,399 --> 00:54:19,959
Come back down this instant!

500
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,035
Everyone out of the way!

501
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,430
Is he all right?

502
00:54:57,799 --> 00:55:03,237
Oh. dear. it's a broken wrist.
Poor boy. Come on now. up you get.

503
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,951
Keep your feet on the ground
while I take him to the hospital wing.

504
00:55:09,159 --> 00:55:12,674
Understand? If I see
a single broom in the air...

505
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:17,908
...the one riding it will be expelled
before they can say Ouidditch.

506
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:19,950
Did you see his face?

507
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:23,835
If he had squeezed this. he'd have
remembered to fall on his arse.

508
00:55:24,039 --> 00:55:26,428
Give it here. Malfoy.

509
00:55:27,239 --> 00:55:30,788
No. I'll leave it somewhere
for Longbottom to find.

510
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,155
How about on the roof?

511
00:55:38,279 --> 00:55:41,954
What's the matter. Potter?
Bit beyond your reach?

512
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:48,035
Harry. no way!
You heard what Madam Hooch said.

513
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:51,038
Besides. you don't know how to fly.

514
00:55:51,319 --> 00:55:53,150
What an idiot.

515
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:59,750
Give it here or I'll
knock you off your broom!

516
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:01,996
Is that so?

517
00:56:04,999 --> 00:56:07,194
Have it your way. then.

518
00:56:38,599 --> 00:56:42,069
-Nice going. Harry.
-That was wicked. Harry!

519
00:56:42,279 --> 00:56:44,235
Harry Potter!

520
00:56:45,159 --> 00:56:47,070
Follow me.

521
00:56:58,279 --> 00:57:00,429
You wait here.

522
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:07,194
Professor Ouirrell. excuse me.
Could I borrow Wood for a moment?

523
00:57:07,399 --> 00:57:09,151
Yes. of course.

524
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:20,118
Potter. this is Oliver Wood.
Wood. l have found you a Seeker.

525
00:57:22,119 --> 00:57:25,475
Have you heard? Harry Potter's
the new Gryffindor Seeker.

526
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:27,836
| always knew he'd do well.

527
00:57:28,279 --> 00:57:32,158
Seeker? But first years
never make the house teams.

528
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:36,672
-You must be the youngest player in--
-A century. McGonagall says.

529
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:39,394
Well done. Harry.
Wood's just told us.

530
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,989
Fred and George are on the team.
Beaters.

531
00:57:42,199 --> 00:57:45,748
Our job is to make sure you
don't get bloodied up too bad.

532
00:57:45,959 --> 00:57:48,519
Can't make any promises.
Rough game. Ouidditch.

533
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:52,507
But no one's died in years.
Someone vanishes occasionally.

534
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,359
But they'll turn up in a month or two.

535
00:57:55,600 --> 00:58:00,993
Go on. Ouidditch is great. Best game
there is. and you'll be great too.

536
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,272
I've never played.
What if I make a fool of myself?

537
00:58:04,679 --> 00:58:09,275
You won't make a fool of yourself.
It's in your blood.

538
00:58:17,479 --> 00:58:21,154
You never told me your father
was a Seeker too.

539
00:58:21,959 --> 00:58:24,075
I didn't know.

540
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:32,791
I'm telling you. it's spooky.
She knows more about you than you do.

541
00:58:32,999 --> 00:58:35,194
Who doesn't?

542
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,116
What's happening?

543
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:42,359
The staircases change. remember?

544
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:51,878
-Let's go this way.
-Before the staircase moves again.

545
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:02,476
Does anybody feel like
we shouldn't be here?

546
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,756
We're not supposed to be here.

547
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:08,714
This is the third floor.
lt's forbidden.

548
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:11,353
Let's go.

549
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:16,233
-|t's Filch's cat!
-Run!

550
00:59:19,879 --> 00:59:23,076
Ouick. let's hide through that door!

551
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,956
-|t's locked!
-We're done for!

552
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,230
Move over!

553
00:59:33,159 --> 00:59:35,195
Alohomora.

554
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:37,870
Get in.

555
00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:40,114
Alohomora?

556
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:42,753
Standard Book of Spells,
chapter seven.

557
00:59:42,959 --> 00:59:46,190
Anyone here. my sweet?

558
00:59:52,199 --> 00:59:53,154
Come on.

559
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,355
-Fi|ch is gone.
-He thinks this door's locked.

560
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:00,070
-It was locked.
-And for good reason.

561
01:00:24,719 --> 01:00:29,952
What are they doing. keeping a thing
like that locked up in a school?

562
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:33,675
Didn't you see what
it was standing on?

563
01:00:33,879 --> 01:00:37,872
I wasn't looking at its feet!
I was preoccupied with its heads.

564
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:40,832
Or maybe you didn't notice.
There were three!

565
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,555
It was standing on a trap door.
It wasn't there by accident.

566
01:00:44,759 --> 01:00:48,149
-|t's guarding something.
-Guarding something?

567
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:52,155
That's right. Now. if you two don't mind.
I'm going to bed...

568
01:00:52,359 --> 01:00:55,829
...before you come up with another idea
to get us killed.

569
01:00:56,039 --> 01:00:59,031
Or worse. expelled.

570
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:06,232
She needs to sort out her priorities.

571
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:14,719
Ouidditch is easy to understand.
Each team has seven players.

572
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:20,392
Three Chasers. two Beaters.
one Keeper and a Seeker. That's you.

573
01:01:25,279 --> 01:01:29,238
There are three kinds of balls.
This one's called the Ouaffle.

574
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:35,151
The Chasers handle the Ouaffle and try
to put it through one of those hoops.

575
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:39,558
The Keeper. that's me.
defends the hoops. With me so far?

576
01:01:39,759 --> 01:01:44,037
I think so. What are those?

577
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,310
You better take this.

578
01:01:57,959 --> 01:02:00,632
Careful now. it's coming back.

579
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:10,430
Not bad. Potter.
You'd make a fair Beater.

580
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,595
What was that?

581
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:32,915
Bludger. Nasty little buggers.

582
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:36,476
But you are a Seeker.

583
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:44,311
The only thing I want you
to worry about is this.

584
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:46,948
The Golden Snitch.

585
01:02:47,159 --> 01:02:50,037
-I like this ball.
-You like it now.

586
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:54,074
Just wait. lt's wicked fast
and damn near impossible to see.

587
01:02:54,279 --> 01:02:56,156
What do I do with it?

588
01:02:56,359 --> 01:02:59,476
You catch it.
Before the other team's Seeker.

589
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:02,075
You catch this. the game's over.

590
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:06,067
You catch this. Potter.
and we win.

591
01:03:14,759 --> 01:03:19,879
One of a wizard's most rudimentary
skills is levitation...

592
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:23,868
...or the ability to make objects fly.

593
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:26,388
Do you have your feathers? Good.

594
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:31,555
Now. don't forget the nice wrist
movement we've been practicing.

595
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:34,957
The swish and flick. Everyone.

596
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:40,873
The swish and flick. Good.
Oh. and enunciate.

597
01:03:41,559 --> 01:03:45,677
Wingardium l.eviosa.
Off you go. then.

598
01:03:46,679 --> 01:03:49,068
Wingardium l. e viosa .

599
01:03:49,319 --> 01:03:51,549
Wingardium l. e viosa .

600
01:03:55,239 --> 01:03:59,312
No. stop. stop. stop! You're going
to take someone's eye out.

601
01:03:59,559 --> 01:04:05,270
Besides. you're saying it wrong.
It's l.eviosa, not l.eviosar.

602
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:09,879
You do it then. if you're so clever.
Go on. go on.

603
01:04:11,079 --> 01:04:14,037
Wingardium L e viosa .

604
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:26,633
Well done! See here. everyone.
Miss Granger's done it!

605
01:04:26,839 --> 01:04:28,431
Splendid!

606
01:04:29,959 --> 01:04:32,075
Well done. dear.

607
01:04:36,119 --> 01:04:40,032
I think we're going to need
another feather over here.

608
01:04:46,279 --> 01:04:50,352
IIlt's Leviosa, not Leviosar. "

609
01:04:50,599 --> 01:04:55,719
She's a nightmare. honestly!
No wonder she hasn't got any friends.

610
01:04:56,359 --> 01:04:58,793
I think she heard you.

611
01:05:26,279 --> 01:05:28,270
Where's Hermione?

612
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:31,472
Parvati said she wouldn't
come out of the bathroom.

613
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:35,593
She said that she'd been in there
all afternoon. crying.

614
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:43,355
Troll in the dungeon!

615
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:46,796
Troll in the dungeon!

616
01:05:49,479 --> 01:05:51,709
Thought you ought to know.

617
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:01,039
Silence!

618
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:06,439
Everyone will please not panic!

619
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:08,593
Now...

620
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:13,156
...prefects will lead their house
back to the dormitories.

621
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:18,435
Teachers will follow me
to the dungeons.

622
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:32,077
Gryffindors. keep up. please.
and stay alert.

623
01:06:32,279 --> 01:06:33,951
How could a troll get in?

624
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:39,109
Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid.
Probably people playing jokes.

625
01:06:39,319 --> 01:06:43,153
-What?
-Hermione! She doesn't know.

626
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:57,877
I think the troll's left the dungeon.

627
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:03,669
It's going into the girls' bathroom.

628
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,715
Hermione. move!

629
01:07:38,959 --> 01:07:42,918
Help! Help!

630
01:07:44,839 --> 01:07:46,830
Hey. pea brain!

631
01:07:58,759 --> 01:08:00,556
Help!

632
01:08:20,839 --> 01:08:23,114
Do something!

633
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:28,267
-What?
-Anything!

634
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:31,189
-Hurry up!
-Swish and flick.

635
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:33,630
Wingardium L e viosa .

636
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,031
Cool.

637
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:12,159
Is it dead?

638
01:09:12,359 --> 01:09:16,113
I don't think so. Just knocked out.

639
01:09:22,119 --> 01:09:24,349
Troll boogers.

640
01:09:26,759 --> 01:09:30,149
Oh. my goodness!
Explain yourselves. both of you!

641
01:09:30,359 --> 01:09:34,796
-Well. what it is--
-|t's my fault. Professor McGonagall.

642
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,029
Miss Granger?

643
01:09:38,879 --> 01:09:43,748
I went looking for the troll.
I thought I could handle it.

644
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:45,757
But I was wrong.

645
01:09:45,959 --> 01:09:50,794
lf Harry and Ron hadn't come
and found me. I'd probably be dead.

646
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:55,992
Be that as it may. it was
an extremely foolish thing to do.

647
01:09:56,199 --> 01:10:01,637
I expected more rational behavior
and am very disappointed in you.

648
01:10:01,839 --> 01:10:04,717
Five points will be taken
from Gryffindor...

649
01:10:04,919 --> 01:10:08,355
...for your serious lack of judgment.

650
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,711
As for you two gentlemen...

651
01:10:10,919 --> 01:10:14,195
...| just hope you realize
how fortunate you are.

652
01:10:14,399 --> 01:10:17,675
Not many first-year students
could take on a troll...

653
01:10:17,879 --> 01:10:20,393
...and live to tell the tale.

654
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:22,949
Five points...

655
01:10:24,279 --> 01:10:27,271
...will be awarded to each of you...

656
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,758
...for sheer dumb luck.

657
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:40,715
Perhaps you ought to go.
It might wake up.

658
01:10:48,199 --> 01:10:50,838
Take a bit of toast. mate. Go on.

659
01:10:51,039 --> 01:10:54,111
Ron's right.
You'll need your strength today.

660
01:10:54,319 --> 01:10:56,435
I'm not hungry.

661
01:10:56,999 --> 01:11:02,392
Good luck today. Potter.
You've proven yourself against a troll.

662
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:05,637
A game of Ouidditch
should be easy work.

663
01:11:05,839 --> 01:11:08,831
Even if it is against Slytherin.

664
01:11:16,199 --> 01:11:19,475
-That explains the blood.
-B|ood?

665
01:11:19,879 --> 01:11:23,838
Last night. I'm guessing Snape let
the troll in as a diversion...

666
01:11:24,039 --> 01:11:26,599
...so he could get past that dog.

667
01:11:26,799 --> 01:11:29,438
But he got bit.
that's why he's limping.

668
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:31,796
But why would anyone go near that dog?

669
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:35,557
At Gringotts. Hagrid took
something out of the vault.

670
01:11:35,759 --> 01:11:38,876
Said it was Hogwarts business.
very secret.

671
01:11:39,079 --> 01:11:40,148
You're saying--

672
01:11:40,359 --> 01:11:44,671
That's what the dog's guarding.
That's what Snape wants.

673
01:11:57,279 --> 01:12:01,067
-Bit early for mail. isn't it?
-But I never get mail.

674
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:03,079
Let's open it.

675
01:12:12,839 --> 01:12:14,033
It's a broomstick.

676
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:18,759
That's not just a broomstick.
it's a Nimbus 2000!

677
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:22,116
But who--?

678
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:45,269
-Scared. Harry?
-A little.

679
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:48,995
It's all right. I felt the same way
before my first game.

680
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:52,555
-What happened?
-I don't really remember.

681
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:55,400
I took a Bludger to the head
two minutes in.

682
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:58,319
Woke up in hospital a week later.

683
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,831
Welcome to Hogwarts' first
Ouidditch game of the season.

684
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:27,556
Today's game.
Slytherin versus Gryffindor!

685
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,955
The players take their positions...

686
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:02,789
...as Madam Hooch steps onto
the field to begin the game!

687
01:14:02,999 --> 01:14:06,196
Now. I want a nice. clean game...

688
01:14:06,799 --> 01:14:09,108
...from all of you!

689
01:14:14,039 --> 01:14:16,837
The Bludgers are up.
followed by the Golden Snitch.

690
01:14:17,039 --> 01:14:19,633
Remember. the Snitch
is worth 150 points.

691
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:23,469
The Seeker who catches the Snitch
ends the game.

692
01:14:29,359 --> 01:14:33,318
The Ouaffle is released
and the game begins!

693
01:14:51,239 --> 01:14:55,835
Angelina Johnson scores!
Ten points for Gryffindor!

694
01:15:00,799 --> 01:15:02,027
Well done!

695
01:15:06,239 --> 01:15:11,711
Slytherin takes the Ouaffle.
Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.

696
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:45,113
Another 10 points to Gryffindor!

697
01:15:58,359 --> 01:16:00,156
Give me that!

698
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:32,833
Take that side!

699
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:23,397
What's going on
with Harry's broomstick?

700
01:17:31,959 --> 01:17:34,075
lt's Snape.
He's jinxing the broom!

701
01:17:34,279 --> 01:17:38,477
-Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
-Leave it to me.

702
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:00,839
Come on. Hermione!

703
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:17,955
Lacarnum Inflamarae.

704
01:18:24,759 --> 01:18:27,671
Fire! You're on fire!

705
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,870
Go. go. go. go!

706
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:38,990
Looks like he's gonna be sick.

707
01:19:40,039 --> 01:19:41,438
He's got the Snitch!

708
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:45,553
Harry Potter receives 150 points
for catching the Snitch!

709
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:47,352
Gryffindor wins!

710
01:20:29,159 --> 01:20:33,232
Nonsense! Why would Snape
put a curse on Harry's broom?

711
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:37,194
Who knows? Why was he trying
to get past that three-headed dog?

712
01:20:37,399 --> 01:20:39,708
-Who told you about Fluffy?
-F|uffy?

713
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:43,435
-That thing has a name?
-Of course he has a name. He's mine.

714
01:20:43,640 --> 01:20:48,714
I bought him off an Irishman.
l lent him to Dumbledore to guard--

715
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:53,311
Shouldn't have said that.
No more questions! That's top-secret.

716
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:57,714
But whatever Fluffy's guarding.
Snape's trying to steal it.

717
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:01,230
Codswallop. Professor Snape
is a Hogwarts teacher.

718
01:21:01,719 --> 01:21:06,588
Teacher or not. I know a spell when
| see one. I've read all about them.

719
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:10,236
You've got to keep eye contact.
and Snape wasn't blinking.

720
01:21:10,439 --> 01:21:12,589
Exactly.

721
01:21:13,239 --> 01:21:15,878
Now. you listen to me.
all three of you.

722
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:20,551
You're meddling in things that ought
not to be meddled in. It's dangerous.

723
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:25,629
What that dog is guarding is
between Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.

724
01:21:25,839 --> 01:21:27,192
Nicholas Flamel?

725
01:21:28,159 --> 01:21:32,675
I shouldn't have said that.
I should not have said that.

726
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:36,793
Nicholas Flamel.
Who's Nicholas Flamel?

727
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,911
I don't know.

728
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,719
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas

729
01:21:59,959 --> 01:22:02,632
Ring the Hogwart bell

730
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:05,513
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas

731
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:08,518
Cast a Christmas spell

732
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:24,757
Knight to e5.

733
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:34,190
Queen to e5.

734
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:40,953
That's totally barbaric!

735
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:44,950
That's wizard's chess.
| see you've packed.

736
01:22:45,159 --> 01:22:46,558
| see you haven't.

737
01:22:46,919 --> 01:22:51,834
Change of plans. My parents went
to Romania to visit my brother Charlie.

738
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:55,715
-He's studying dragons there.
-Good. You can help Harry.

739
01:22:55,919 --> 01:22:59,150
He's going to the library
to look up Nicholas Flamel.

740
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:02,716
We've looked a hundred times!

741
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:08,348
Not in the restricted section.
Happy Christmas.

742
01:23:10,479 --> 01:23:13,277
I think we've had
a bad influence on her.

743
01:23:15,719 --> 01:23:19,871
Harry. wake up!
Come on. Harry. wake up!

744
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:32,517
-Happy Christmas. Harry.
-Happy Christmas. Ron.

745
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:34,836
What are you wearing?

746
01:23:35,399 --> 01:23:38,948
Oh. my mum made it.
Looks like you've got one too.

747
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:42,349
-|'ve got presents?
-Yeah.

748
01:23:49,479 --> 01:23:51,470
There they are.

749
01:24:02,039 --> 01:24:05,395
IIYour father left this
in my possession before he died.

750
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:09,599
It is time it was returned to you.
Use it well.II

751
01:24:25,719 --> 01:24:29,268
-What is it?
-Some kind of cloak.

752
01:24:29,560 --> 01:24:32,358
Well. let's see. then. Put it on.

753
01:24:37,559 --> 01:24:38,787
My body's gone!

754
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,436
I know what that is.
That's an invisibility cloak!

755
01:24:42,959 --> 01:24:44,790
l'm invisible?

756
01:24:45,239 --> 01:24:49,471
They're really rare.
I wonder who gave it to you.

757
01:24:49,919 --> 01:24:54,515
There was no name.
It just said. IIUse it well.II

758
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:27,072
Famous Fire-Eaters.
Filteenth- Century Fiends.

759
01:25:27,279 --> 01:25:32,876
Flamel. Nicholas Flamel.
Where are you?

760
01:25:50,919 --> 01:25:52,750
Who's there?

761
01:25:58,640 --> 01:26:04,033
I know you're in there.
You can't hide.

762
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:14,715
Who is it? Show yourself.

763
01:26:59,959 --> 01:27:01,278
Severus. l....

764
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:05,629
You don't want me
as your enemy. Ouirrell.

765
01:27:05,839 --> 01:27:10,355
-I don't know what you mean.
-You know perfectly well what I mean.

766
01:27:26,879 --> 01:27:29,951
We'll have another little chat soon.

767
01:27:30,159 --> 01:27:35,392
When you've had time to decide
where your loyalties lie.

768
01:27:35,639 --> 01:27:39,871
Professors. I found this
in the restricted section.

769
01:27:40,399 --> 01:27:45,234
It's still hot. That means
there's a student out of bed.

770
01:29:13,559 --> 01:29:15,311
Mum?

771
01:29:18,439 --> 01:29:20,350
Dad?

772
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:58,434
Ron. you've really gotta see this!
Ron. you've gotta see this!

773
01:30:00,199 --> 01:30:02,952
Ron. come on. get out of bed!

774
01:30:03,159 --> 01:30:06,595
-Why?
-There's something you've got to see!

775
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:17,158
Come on! Come!
Come look. it's my parents!

776
01:30:18,559 --> 01:30:20,436
| only see us.

777
01:30:20,679 --> 01:30:23,876
Look in properly.
Go on. stand there.

778
01:30:24,079 --> 01:30:29,756
-There. You see them. don't you?
-That's me! Only l'm head boy.

779
01:30:30,239 --> 01:30:32,469
And I'm holding the Ouidditch Cup.

780
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:36,713
And bloody hell!
I'm Ouidditch captain too!

781
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:40,155
I look good.

782
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:44,435
Harry. do you think this mirror
shows the future?

783
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:49,395
How can it?
Both my parents are dead.

784
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:13,670
Back again. Harry?

785
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:19,029
| see that you.
like many before you...

786
01:31:19,239 --> 01:31:23,232
...have discovered the delights
of the Mirror of Erised.

787
01:31:23,559 --> 01:31:27,552
I trust by now
you realize what it does.

788
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:31,234
Let me give you a clue.

789
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:33,796
The happiest man on earth...

790
01:31:33,999 --> 01:31:37,230
...would look in the mirror
and see only himself...

791
01:31:37,439 --> 01:31:39,669
...exactly as he is.

792
01:31:39,879 --> 01:31:44,714
So then. it shows us what we want.
Whatever we want.

793
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:47,559
Yes. And no.

794
01:31:48,559 --> 01:31:50,914
It shows us nothing more or less...

795
01:31:51,119 --> 01:31:56,830
...than the deepest and most desperate
desires of our hearts.

796
01:31:57,039 --> 01:32:01,555
Now you. Harry. who have
never known your family...

797
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:05,469
...you see them standing beside you.

798
01:32:05,679 --> 01:32:07,988
But remember this. Harry.

799
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:13,872
This mirror gives us
neither knowledge...

800
01:32:14,079 --> 01:32:16,115
...or truth.

801
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:22,831
Men have wasted away in front of it.
Even gone mad.

802
01:32:23,840 --> 01:32:27,799
That is why tomorrow
it will be moved to a new home.

803
01:32:27,999 --> 01:32:29,830
And I must ask you...

804
01:32:30,759 --> 01:32:34,468
...not to go looking for it again.

805
01:32:35,199 --> 01:32:38,191
It does not do to dwell on dreams...

806
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:41,513
...and forget to live.

807
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:39,438
I had you looking in the wrong section.
How could I be so stupid?

808
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:42,637
I checked this out weeks ago
for a bit of light reading.

809
01:33:42,839 --> 01:33:44,750
This is light?

810
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:51,469
Of course! Here it is!

811
01:33:51,679 --> 01:33:55,513
Nicholas Flamel is the only known
maker of the Philosopher's Stone.

812
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:56,875
The what?

813
01:33:57,519 --> 01:34:00,397
Honestly. don't you two read?

814
01:34:00,599 --> 01:34:04,911
IIThe Philosopher's Stone is a legendary
substance with astonishing powers.

815
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:07,634
lt'll transform any metal
into pure gold...

816
01:34:07,839 --> 01:34:11,673
...and produces the Elixir of Life
which will make the drinker immortal.II

817
01:34:11,879 --> 01:34:13,949
-|mmorta|?
-It means you'll never die.

818
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:16,151
I know what it means!

819
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:21,516
IIThe only Stone currently in existence
belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel...

820
01:34:21,719 --> 01:34:26,668
...the noted alchemist who last year
celebrated his 665th birthday.II

821
01:34:28,319 --> 01:34:30,389
That's what Fluffy's guarding.

822
01:34:30,599 --> 01:34:35,115
That's what's under the trap door.
The Philosopher's Stone.

823
01:34:51,199 --> 01:34:54,828
Don't wish to be rude.
but I'm in no state to entertain.

824
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:57,634
We know about the Philosopher's Stone.

825
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:07,075
-We think Snape's trying to steal it.
-Are you still on about him?

826
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:09,953
We know he's after it.
We don't know why.

827
01:35:10,319 --> 01:35:14,312
Snape is one of the teachers
protecting the Stone. He won't steal it.

828
01:35:14,559 --> 01:35:15,594
What?

829
01:35:15,759 --> 01:35:19,035
You heard. Come on.
I'm a bit preoccupied today.

830
01:35:19,239 --> 01:35:21,799
Wait a minute.
IIOne of the teachers"?

831
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,709
There are other things
defending the Stone. aren't there?

832
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:28,434
-Spe|ls. enchantments.
-Right.

833
01:35:28,679 --> 01:35:31,591
Waste of bloody time. if you ask me.

834
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:33,791
Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy.

835
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,515
Ain't a soul knows how.
except for me and Dumbledore.

836
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:41,196
I shouldn't have told you that.
I should not have told you that.

837
01:35:54,479 --> 01:35:59,348
-Hagrid. what exactly is that?
-That? lt's....

838
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:01,511
I know what that is!

839
01:36:01,719 --> 01:36:04,233
But. Hagrid. how did you get one?

840
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:07,717
I won it. Off a stranger
I met down at the pub.

841
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:11,833
Seemed quite glad to be rid of it.
as a matter of fact.

842
01:36:33,159 --> 01:36:35,275
Is that...

843
01:36:36,039 --> 01:36:37,154
...a dragon?

844
01:36:37,359 --> 01:36:41,591
That's not just a dragon.
That's a Norwegian Ridgeback.

845
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:44,553
My brother works
with these in Romania.

846
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:49,436
lsn't he beautiful? Oh. bless him.
Look. he knows his mummy.

847
01:36:50,079 --> 01:36:51,751
Hello. Norbert.

848
01:36:52,079 --> 01:36:56,197
-Norbert?
-He's gotta have a name. don't he?

849
01:36:56,919 --> 01:36:59,274
Don't you. Norbert?

850
01:37:05,959 --> 01:37:08,951
He'll have to be trained up a bit.
of course.

851
01:37:12,679 --> 01:37:14,670
Who's that?

852
01:37:16,319 --> 01:37:18,310
Malfoy.

853
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:20,393
Oh. dear.

854
01:37:22,040 --> 01:37:26,636
Hagrid always wanted a dragon.
Told me so the first time I met him.

855
01:37:26,839 --> 01:37:30,718
It's crazy.
And worse. Malfoy knows.

856
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:34,833
-I don't understand. Is that bad?
-|t's bad.

857
01:37:35,120 --> 01:37:37,190
Good evening.

858
01:37:40,679 --> 01:37:43,477
Nothing. I repeat. nothing...

859
01:37:43,719 --> 01:37:47,075
...gives a student the right
to walk about at night.

860
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:51,956
Therefore. as punishment for your actions.
50 points will be taken.

861
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:54,390
-50?!
-Each.

862
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:57,675
To ensure it doesn't happen again...

863
01:37:57,879 --> 01:38:01,076
...all four of you
will receive detention.

864
01:38:01,959 --> 01:38:04,792
Excuse me. professor.
perhaps I heard you wrong.

865
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,230
I thought you said the four of us.

866
01:38:07,439 --> 01:38:09,828
No. you heard me correctly.

867
01:38:10,040 --> 01:38:14,830
Honorable as your intentions were.
you too were out of bed after hours.

868
01:38:15,279 --> 01:38:18,112
You will join your classmates
in detention.

869
01:38:28,880 --> 01:38:32,714
A pity they let
the old punishments die.

870
01:38:32,919 --> 01:38:37,435
Was a time detention found you
hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons.

871
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:40,359
God. I miss the screaming.

872
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:45,951
You'll be serving detention
with Hagrid tonight.

873
01:38:46,160 --> 01:38:51,280
He's got a little job to do
inside the Dark Forest.

874
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:56,113
A sorry lot. this. Hagrid.

875
01:38:57,519 --> 01:39:02,309
Good God. you're not still on
about that bloody dragon. are you?

876
01:39:04,479 --> 01:39:06,470
Norbert's gone.

877
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:10,390
Dumbledore sent him off to Romania
to live in a colony.

878
01:39:10,679 --> 01:39:13,796
That's good. isn't it?
He's with his own kind.

879
01:39:13,959 --> 01:39:16,189
What if he don't like Romania?

880
01:39:16,400 --> 01:39:20,473
What if the other dragons are mean
to him? He's only a baby.

881
01:39:21,079 --> 01:39:26,107
For God's sake. pull yourself together.
You're going into the Forest.

882
01:39:26,319 --> 01:39:28,594
Got to have your wits about you.

883
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:34,238
The Forest? I thought that was a joke.
We can't go in there.

884
01:39:34,679 --> 01:39:38,354
Students aren't allowed.
And there are...

885
01:39:39,839 --> 01:39:41,033
...werewolves.

886
01:39:41,439 --> 01:39:44,590
There's more than werewolves
in those trees.

887
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:47,360
You can be sure of that.

888
01:39:49,239 --> 01:39:50,592
Nighty-night.

889
01:39:53,079 --> 01:39:55,798
Right. Let's go.

890
01:40:32,439 --> 01:40:34,748
Hagrid. what is that?

891
01:40:34,959 --> 01:40:38,190
What we're here for.
See that?

892
01:40:38,679 --> 01:40:43,833
That's unicorn blood. that is.
I found one dead a few weeks ago.

893
01:40:44,360 --> 01:40:48,751
Now. this one's been hurt bad
by something.

894
01:40:55,959 --> 01:41:01,477
So. it's our job to go
and find the poor beast.

895
01:41:01,679 --> 01:41:04,671
Ron. Hermione. come with me.

896
01:41:05,120 --> 01:41:08,271
And. Harry. you'll go with Malfoy.

897
01:41:09,479 --> 01:41:11,674
Okay. Then I get Fang.

898
01:41:11,839 --> 01:41:17,357
Fine. Just so you know.
he's a bloody coward.

899
01:41:20,879 --> 01:41:25,669
Wait till my father hears about this.
This is servant's stuff.

900
01:41:25,880 --> 01:41:29,634
If I didn't know better.
I'd say you were scared.

901
01:41:29,839 --> 01:41:32,307
I'm not scared. Potter.

902
01:41:33,400 --> 01:41:35,277
Do you hear that?

903
01:41:37,719 --> 01:41:39,072
Come on. Fang.

904
01:41:39,279 --> 01:41:40,712
Scared!

905
01:42:04,679 --> 01:42:06,749
What is it. Fang?

906
01:43:14,240 --> 01:43:19,519
Harry Potter. you must leave.
You are known to many creatures here.

907
01:43:19,719 --> 01:43:23,553
The Forest is not safe at this time.
Especially for you.

908
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:26,399
What was that thing you saved me from?

909
01:43:26,600 --> 01:43:31,720
A monstrous creature.
It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn.

910
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:37,233
Drinking its blood will keep you alive
even if you are an inch from death.

911
01:43:37,439 --> 01:43:42,308
But at a terrible price. For you
have slain something so pure...

912
01:43:42,519 --> 01:43:47,149
...that the moment the blood touches
your lips. you will have a half-life.

913
01:43:47,360 --> 01:43:49,078
A cursed life.

914
01:43:49,280 --> 01:43:53,068
-Who would choose such a life?
-Can you think of no one?

915
01:43:53,280 --> 01:43:58,035
Do you mean to say that
that thing that killed the unicorn...

916
01:43:58,359 --> 01:44:02,113
...that was drinking its blood.
that was Voldemort?

917
01:44:02,319 --> 01:44:07,268
Do you know what is hidden
in the school at this very moment?

918
01:44:08,079 --> 01:44:09,558
The Philosopher's Stone.

919
01:44:10,839 --> 01:44:12,750
Harry!

920
01:44:13,319 --> 01:44:17,631
Hello there. Firenze.
See you've met our young Mr. Potter.

921
01:44:17,839 --> 01:44:19,909
You all right there. Harry?

922
01:44:20,999 --> 01:44:25,117
Harry Potter.
this is where I leave you.

923
01:44:25,959 --> 01:44:29,634
You're safe now. Good luck.

924
01:44:36,959 --> 01:44:40,918
You mean. You-Know-Who is out there
right now in the Forest?

925
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:43,793
But he's weak.
He's living off the unicorns.

926
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,798
Don't you see? We had it wrong.

927
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:51,198
Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself.
He wants it for Voldemort.

928
01:44:51,399 --> 01:44:55,756
With the Elixir of Life.
Voldemort will be strong again.

929
01:44:55,960 --> 01:44:57,473
He'll come back.

930
01:44:57,680 --> 01:44:59,352
But if he comes back...

931
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:03,388
...you don't think he'll try
to kill you. do you?

932
01:45:04,360 --> 01:45:07,750
lf he'd had the chance.
he might have tried tonight.

933
01:45:07,960 --> 01:45:11,396
And to think I've been worrying
about my Potions final.

934
01:45:11,600 --> 01:45:15,036
Hang on a minute.
We're forgetting one thing.

935
01:45:15,399 --> 01:45:20,075
Who's the one wizard
Voldemort always feared?

936
01:45:20,799 --> 01:45:25,714
Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore
is around. Harry. you're safe.

937
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:29,799
As long as Dumbledore is around.
you can't be touched.

938
01:45:35,319 --> 01:45:40,518
I'd heard Hogwarts' final exams were
frightful. but I found that enjoyable.

939
01:45:40,720 --> 01:45:44,235
Speak for yourself.
All right there. Harry?

940
01:45:44,439 --> 01:45:49,388
-My scar. It keeps burning.
-|t's happened before.

941
01:45:49,599 --> 01:45:52,159
-Not like this.
-You should see the nurse.

942
01:45:52,360 --> 01:45:55,716
I think it's a warning.
It means danger's coming.

943
01:46:03,039 --> 01:46:05,394
-Of course!
-What is it?

944
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:09,195
Isn't it odd that what Hagrid wants
more than anything is a dragon...

945
01:46:09,399 --> 01:46:12,357
...and a stranger just happens
to have one?

946
01:46:12,559 --> 01:46:15,119
How many people wander around
with dragon eggs?

947
01:46:15,319 --> 01:46:17,469
Why didn't I see it before?

948
01:46:22,839 --> 01:46:26,195
Who gave you the egg?
What did he look like?

949
01:46:26,399 --> 01:46:29,038
I never saw his face.
He kept his hood up.

950
01:46:29,240 --> 01:46:31,708
You and this stranger
must have talked.

951
01:46:32,279 --> 01:46:35,669
He wanted to know what sort
of creatures I looked after.

952
01:46:35,880 --> 01:46:39,714
I said. IIAfter Fluffy.
a dragon's gonna be no problem.II

953
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:44,198
-Was he interested in Fluffy?
-Of course he was interested.

954
01:46:44,600 --> 01:46:48,593
How often do you come across
a three-headed dog?

955
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:54,193
But I told him. IIThe trick with any beast
is to know how to calm him.II

956
01:46:54,399 --> 01:46:59,632
Take Fluffy. for example. Play him
music and he falls straight to sleep.

957
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:03,794
I shouldn't have told you that.

958
01:47:04,040 --> 01:47:06,156
Where are you going?

959
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:15,519
We have to see Dumbledore.
Immediately!

960
01:47:15,960 --> 01:47:18,474
I'm afraid he's not here.

961
01:47:18,680 --> 01:47:22,798
He received an urgent owl
from the Ministry of Magic and left.

962
01:47:23,199 --> 01:47:25,633
He's gone?
But this is important!

963
01:47:25,880 --> 01:47:27,996
This is about the Philosopher's Stone!

964
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:33,389
-How do you know--?
-Someone's going to try and steal it.

965
01:47:33,999 --> 01:47:38,993
I don't know how you know.
but I assure you it is well protected.

966
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:43,318
Now would you go back
to your dormitories? Ouietly.

967
01:47:51,279 --> 01:47:53,952
That was no stranger Hagrid met.
It was Snape.

968
01:47:54,159 --> 01:47:56,719
Which means he knows
how to get past Fluffy.

969
01:47:56,920 --> 01:48:00,629
-And with Dumbledore gone--
-Good afternoon.

970
01:48:02,600 --> 01:48:05,558
What would three young Gryffindors...

971
01:48:05,799 --> 01:48:09,917
...be doing inside on a day like this?

972
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:17,870
-We were just--
-You ought to be careful.

973
01:48:18,399 --> 01:48:20,276
People will think you're...

974
01:48:24,399 --> 01:48:26,993
...up to something.

975
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:38,791
Now what do we do?

976
01:48:38,999 --> 01:48:42,594
We go down the trap door. Tonight.

977
01:48:55,799 --> 01:48:57,198
Trevor.

978
01:48:57,519 --> 01:49:00,795
Trevor. go! You shouldn't be here!

979
01:49:01,039 --> 01:49:06,238
Neither should you.
You're sneaking out again. aren't you?

980
01:49:06,439 --> 01:49:10,227
-Nevi|le. listen. We were--
-No. I won't let you!

981
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:14,871
You'll get Gryffindor into trouble again.
I'll fight you.

982
01:49:15,079 --> 01:49:19,197
Neville. I'm really sorry about this.
Petrificus Totalus.

983
01:49:26,839 --> 01:49:30,468
You're a little scary sometimes.
you know that?

984
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:34,190
Brilliant. but scary.

985
01:49:34,839 --> 01:49:36,795
Let's go.

986
01:49:36,999 --> 01:49:41,072
-Sorry.
-|t's for your own good. you know.

987
01:49:46,279 --> 01:49:50,067
-You stood on my foot!
-Sorry.

988
01:49:53,799 --> 01:49:55,755
Alohomora.

989
01:50:07,279 --> 01:50:09,747
Wait a minute. He's...

990
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:12,990
...snoring.

991
01:50:15,399 --> 01:50:20,712
Snape's already been here.
He's put a spell on the harp.

992
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:25,118
It's got horrible breath.

993
01:50:27,599 --> 01:50:29,590
-We have to move its paw.
-What?

994
01:50:29,799 --> 01:50:31,152
Come on!

995
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:37,031
Okay. Push.

996
01:50:59,240 --> 01:51:02,710
I'll go first. Don't follow
until I give you a sign.

997
01:51:02,920 --> 01:51:07,710
If something bad happens.
get yourselves out.

998
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:11,790
Does it seem a bit quiet to you?

999
01:51:12,480 --> 01:51:14,232
The harp.

1000
01:51:14,880 --> 01:51:17,474
lt's stopped playing.

1001
01:51:27,120 --> 01:51:28,189
Jump!

1002
01:51:41,799 --> 01:51:45,269
Lucky this plant thing's here. really.

1003
01:51:59,120 --> 01:52:02,078
Stop moving. both of you.
This is Devil's Snare.

1004
01:52:02,280 --> 01:52:05,829
You have to relax. If you don't.
it will only kill you faster.

1005
01:52:06,039 --> 01:52:10,829
Kill us faster?
Oh. now I can relax!

1006
01:52:12,999 --> 01:52:14,273
Hermione!

1007
01:52:14,839 --> 01:52:18,468
-Now what are we gonna do?
-Just relax!

1008
01:52:18,679 --> 01:52:22,991
-Hermione. where are you?
-Do what I say! Trust me.

1009
01:52:29,799 --> 01:52:32,996
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. I'm fine.

1010
01:52:33,200 --> 01:52:36,112
-He's not relaxing. is he?
-Apparently not.

1011
01:52:36,319 --> 01:52:38,753
-We've gotta do something.
-What?

1012
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:41,758
I remember reading something
in Herbology.

1013
01:52:42,599 --> 01:52:46,274
Devil's Snare. Devil's Snare.
lt's deadly fun...

1014
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:50,678
...but will sulk in the sun!
That's it! It hates sunlight.

1015
01:52:50,920 --> 01:52:52,876
Lumus Solem.

1016
01:53:00,639 --> 01:53:03,107
-Ron. you okay?
-Yeah.

1017
01:53:05,720 --> 01:53:08,075
Lucky we didn't panic.

1018
01:53:08,799 --> 01:53:12,155
Lucky Hermione pays attention
in Herbology.

1019
01:53:13,720 --> 01:53:15,153
What is that?

1020
01:53:15,359 --> 01:53:18,908
I don't know. Sounds like wings.

1021
01:53:31,519 --> 01:53:34,829
Curious. I've never seen
birds like these.

1022
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:38,510
They're not birds.
They're keys.

1023
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:42,030
And I'll bet one of them
fits that door.

1024
01:53:45,359 --> 01:53:49,796
-What's this all about?
-I don't know.

1025
01:53:55,440 --> 01:53:57,396
Strange.

1026
01:53:57,799 --> 01:53:59,994
Alohomora!

1027
01:54:02,839 --> 01:54:04,989
Well. it was worth a try.

1028
01:54:05,200 --> 01:54:08,317
What will we do?
There must be a thousand keys.

1029
01:54:08,519 --> 01:54:12,273
We want a big. old-fashioned one.
Probably rusty.

1030
01:54:12,480 --> 01:54:15,756
| see it!
The one with the broken wing.

1031
01:54:19,200 --> 01:54:21,430
What's wrong?

1032
01:54:22,279 --> 01:54:23,712
It's too simple.

1033
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:28,471
Go on! If Snape could catch it
on that old broomstick. you can.

1034
01:54:28,680 --> 01:54:32,070
You're the youngest Seeker
in a century.

1035
01:54:48,240 --> 01:54:51,118
This complicates things a bit.

1036
01:55:11,519 --> 01:55:13,350
Catch the key!

1037
01:55:17,600 --> 01:55:19,431
Hurry up!

1038
01:55:50,599 --> 01:55:55,070
I don't like this.
I don't like this at all.

1039
01:55:55,279 --> 01:55:58,316
Where are we? A graveyard.

1040
01:55:58,679 --> 01:56:01,193
This is no graveyard.

1041
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:11,198
It's a chessboard.

1042
01:56:22,679 --> 01:56:24,510
There's the door.

1043
01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:37,513
Now what do we do?

1044
01:56:37,880 --> 01:56:41,839
It's obvious. isn't it? We've got
to play our way across the room.

1045
01:56:42,400 --> 01:56:45,995
Harry. you take
the empty bishop's square.

1046
01:56:46,319 --> 01:56:50,358
Hermione. you'll be
the queen-side castle.

1047
01:56:50,599 --> 01:56:54,478
As for me. I'll be a knight.

1048
01:57:01,359 --> 01:57:02,997
What happens now?

1049
01:57:03,759 --> 01:57:06,637
Well. white moves first.

1050
01:57:06,839 --> 01:57:08,636
And then...

1051
01:57:10,319 --> 01:57:11,513
...we play.

1052
01:57:21,680 --> 01:57:26,515
Ron. you don't suppose
this is going to be like...

1053
01:57:26,759 --> 01:57:30,149
...real wizard's chess. do you?

1054
01:57:30,519 --> 01:57:33,352
You there. d5.

1055
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:48,873
Yes. Hermione.

1056
01:57:49,080 --> 01:57:53,949
I think this is gonna be
exactly like wizard's chess.

1057
01:57:59,640 --> 01:58:02,029
Castle to e4!

1058
01:58:05,519 --> 01:58:07,714
Pawn to c3!

1059
01:58:50,519 --> 01:58:54,353
-Wait a minute.
-You understand right. Harry.

1060
01:58:54,600 --> 01:58:59,116
Once I make my move.
the queen will take me.

1061
01:58:59,720 --> 01:59:01,950
Then you're free to check the king.

1062
01:59:02,160 --> 01:59:04,754
-No. Ron. no!
-What is it?

1063
01:59:05,359 --> 01:59:09,830
-He's going to sacrifice himself.
-No. there must be another way!

1064
01:59:10,039 --> 01:59:13,634
Do you wanna stop Snape
from getting that Stone or not?

1065
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:17,276
Harry. it's you that has to go on.
I know it.

1066
01:59:17,759 --> 01:59:20,398
Not me. Not Hermione. You.

1067
01:59:30,240 --> 01:59:33,038
Knight to h3.

1068
01:59:53,120 --> 01:59:55,031
Check.

1069
02:00:22,999 --> 02:00:24,717
Ron!

1070
02:00:24,920 --> 02:00:30,472
No. don't move!
Don't forget. we're still playing.

1071
02:00:44,920 --> 02:00:46,148
Checkmate.

1072
02:01:05,279 --> 02:01:07,668
Take care of Ron.
Then go to the owlery.

1073
02:01:07,880 --> 02:01:11,589
Send a message to Dumbledore.
Ron's right.

1074
02:01:11,800 --> 02:01:13,597
l have to go on.

1075
02:01:14,080 --> 02:01:19,757
You'll be okay. Harry.
You're a great wizard. You really are.

1076
02:01:19,960 --> 02:01:22,349
Not as good as you.

1077
02:01:23,160 --> 02:01:27,790
Me? Books and cleverness.
There are more important things.

1078
02:01:28,959 --> 02:01:34,352
Friendship and bravery.
And. Harry. just be careful.

1079
02:02:10,879 --> 02:02:12,471
You?

1080
02:02:13,240 --> 02:02:16,915
No. it can't be.
Snape. he was the--

1081
02:02:17,119 --> 02:02:20,031
Yes. he does seem the type.
doesn't he?

1082
02:02:20,240 --> 02:02:23,232
Next to him. who would suspect...

1083
02:02:23,439 --> 02:02:27,193
...poor. stuttering
Professor Ouirrell?

1084
02:02:27,400 --> 02:02:32,554
But that day. during the Ouidditch match.
Snape tried to kill me.

1085
02:02:32,759 --> 02:02:35,432
No. dear boy. I tried to kill you!

1086
02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:39,913
lf Snape's cloak hadn't caught
fire and broken my eye contact...

1087
02:02:40,120 --> 02:02:42,236
...I would have succeeded.

1088
02:02:42,439 --> 02:02:45,317
Even with Snape muttering
his countercurse.

1089
02:02:45,519 --> 02:02:47,635
Snape was trying to save me?

1090
02:02:47,839 --> 02:02:52,959
I knew you were a danger to me.
especially after Halloween.

1091
02:02:53,160 --> 02:02:57,233
-Then you let the troll in!
-Very good. Potter. yes.

1092
02:02:57,439 --> 02:03:00,317
Snape. unfortunately. wasn't fooled.

1093
02:03:00,880 --> 02:03:05,635
While everyone ran about.
he went to the third floor to head me off.

1094
02:03:06,520 --> 02:03:09,876
He. of course. never trusted me again.

1095
02:03:10,840 --> 02:03:15,868
He rarely left me alone.
But he doesn't understand.

1096
02:03:16,079 --> 02:03:19,958
I'm never alone. Never.

1097
02:03:20,160 --> 02:03:24,073
Now. what does this mirror do?

1098
02:03:25,599 --> 02:03:27,635
| see what I desire.

1099
02:03:28,159 --> 02:03:32,391
| see myself holding the Stone.
But how do | get it?

1100
02:03:32,600 --> 02:03:34,670
Use the boy.

1101
02:03:35,439 --> 02:03:39,193
Come here. Potter! Now!

1102
02:03:50,799 --> 02:03:54,633
Tell me. what do you see?

1103
02:04:18,760 --> 02:04:21,069
What is it? What do you see?

1104
02:04:21,279 --> 02:04:26,228
l'm shaking hands with Dumbledore.
I've won the house cup.

1105
02:04:26,440 --> 02:04:27,919
He lies.

1106
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:31,949
Tell the truth! What do you see?

1107
02:04:32,160 --> 02:04:36,358
-Let me speak to him.
-Master. you are not strong enough.

1108
02:04:36,600 --> 02:04:40,434
l have strength enough for this.

1109
02:04:57,880 --> 02:05:00,633
Harry Potter...

1110
02:05:00,840 --> 02:05:03,070
...we meet again.

1111
02:05:03,279 --> 02:05:04,632
Voldemort.

1112
02:05:04,840 --> 02:05:08,628
Yes. You see what I've become?

1113
02:05:08,879 --> 02:05:12,315
See what I must do to survive?

1114
02:05:12,520 --> 02:05:16,479
Live off another. A mere parasite.

1115
02:05:17,119 --> 02:05:20,316
Unicorn blood can sustain me...

1116
02:05:20,520 --> 02:05:24,035
...but it cannot give me
a body of my own.

1117
02:05:24,240 --> 02:05:27,630
But there is something that can.

1118
02:05:27,839 --> 02:05:33,277
Something that. conveniently enough.
lies in your pocket.

1119
02:05:33,640 --> 02:05:35,119
Stop him!

1120
02:05:39,960 --> 02:05:42,599
Don't be a fool.

1121
02:05:43,080 --> 02:05:46,072
Why suffer an horrific death...

1122
02:05:46,279 --> 02:05:49,749
...when you can join me and live?

1123
02:05:49,959 --> 02:05:50,994
Never!

1124
02:05:52,920 --> 02:05:57,516
Bravery. Your parents had it too.

1125
02:05:58,239 --> 02:06:01,390
Tell me. Harry...

1126
02:06:01,639 --> 02:06:05,348
...would you like to see
your mother and father again?

1127
02:06:05,599 --> 02:06:07,590
Together...

1128
02:06:07,799 --> 02:06:10,233
...we can bring them back.

1129
02:06:10,640 --> 02:06:15,156
All | ask is for something in return.

1130
02:06:21,599 --> 02:06:24,591
That's it. Harry.

1131
02:06:25,440 --> 02:06:29,149
There is no good and evil.

1132
02:06:29,359 --> 02:06:32,237
There is only power...

1133
02:06:32,439 --> 02:06:36,398
...and those too weak to seek it.

1134
02:06:37,040 --> 02:06:41,875
Together. we'll do
extraordinary things.

1135
02:06:42,280 --> 02:06:44,430
Just give me the Stone!

1136
02:06:46,960 --> 02:06:48,075
You liar!

1137
02:06:48,280 --> 02:06:50,316
Kill him!

1138
02:07:12,879 --> 02:07:17,999
-What is this magic?
-Fool. get the Stone!

1139
02:08:58,959 --> 02:09:01,348
Good afternoon. Harry.

1140
02:09:03,400 --> 02:09:07,712
-Tokens from your admirers?
-Admirers?

1141
02:09:07,920 --> 02:09:13,677
What happened in the dungeons between
you and Professor Ouirrell is a secret.

1142
02:09:13,880 --> 02:09:18,476
So. naturally. the whole school knows.

1143
02:09:20,719 --> 02:09:24,189
| see that your friend Ronald
has saved you the trouble...

1144
02:09:24,399 --> 02:09:27,118
...of opening your Chocolate Frogs.

1145
02:09:27,320 --> 02:09:30,198
Ron was here? Is he all right?
What about Hermione?

1146
02:09:30,399 --> 02:09:35,075
Fine. They're both just fine.

1147
02:09:35,640 --> 02:09:38,313
-What happened to the Stone?
-Re|ax. dear boy.

1148
02:09:38,639 --> 02:09:41,358
The Stone has been destroyed.

1149
02:09:41,599 --> 02:09:45,638
My friend Nicholas and l
have had a little chat...

1150
02:09:45,839 --> 02:09:49,627
...and agreed it was best all around.

1151
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:53,515
But then. Flamel.
he'll die. won't he?

1152
02:09:55,479 --> 02:10:00,758
He has enough Elixir
to set his affairs in order.

1153
02:10:00,960 --> 02:10:04,032
But yes. he will die.

1154
02:10:04,240 --> 02:10:06,595
How is it I got the Stone. sir?

1155
02:10:06,799 --> 02:10:09,233
One minute I was staring
in the mirror and--

1156
02:10:09,439 --> 02:10:13,352
You see. only a person...

1157
02:10:13,639 --> 02:10:17,393
...who wanted to find the Stone.
find it...

1158
02:10:17,640 --> 02:10:21,997
...but not use it.
would be able to get it.

1159
02:10:22,920 --> 02:10:26,276
That is one of my more brilliant ideas.

1160
02:10:26,479 --> 02:10:31,314
And between you and me.
that is saying something.

1161
02:10:32,719 --> 02:10:37,713
Does that mean. with the Stone gone.
that Voldemort can never come back?

1162
02:10:37,920 --> 02:10:40,150
I'm afraid...

1163
02:10:41,519 --> 02:10:45,398
...there are ways
in which he can return.

1164
02:10:46,079 --> 02:10:48,547
Harry. do you know why...

1165
02:10:48,760 --> 02:10:52,594
...Professor Ouirrell couldn't bear
to have you touch him?

1166
02:10:52,799 --> 02:10:57,236
It was because of your mother.
She sacrificed herself for you.

1167
02:10:57,759 --> 02:11:00,831
And that kind of act leaves a mark.

1168
02:11:01,039 --> 02:11:04,668
No. this kind of mark cannot be seen.

1169
02:11:04,879 --> 02:11:09,589
-|t lives in your very skin.
-What is it?

1170
02:11:10,399 --> 02:11:13,994
Love. Harry. Love.

1171
02:11:21,719 --> 02:11:25,678
Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

1172
02:11:25,880 --> 02:11:30,351
l was most unfortunate in my youth
to come across a vomit-flavored one.

1173
02:11:30,600 --> 02:11:33,751
And since then.
I've lost my liking for them.

1174
02:11:33,959 --> 02:11:37,190
But I think I could be safe...

1175
02:11:37,399 --> 02:11:39,674
...with a nice toffee.

1176
02:11:43,599 --> 02:11:45,078
Alas!

1177
02:11:45,759 --> 02:11:47,795
Earwax.

1178
02:12:02,400 --> 02:12:05,437
-All right there. Ron?
-All right. You?

1179
02:12:06,520 --> 02:12:09,114
All right. Hermione?

1180
02:12:09,759 --> 02:12:11,511
Never better.

1181
02:12:26,680 --> 02:12:29,035
Another year gone.

1182
02:12:29,759 --> 02:12:34,116
And now. as I understand it.
