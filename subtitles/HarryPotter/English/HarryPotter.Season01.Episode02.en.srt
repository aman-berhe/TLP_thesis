1
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,350
I can't let you out. Hedwig.

2
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,910
I'm not allowed to use magic
outside of school.

3
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,069
Besides. if Uncle Vernon--
-Harry Potter!

4
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,398
Now you've done it.

5
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:30,599
He's in there. Vernon?

6
00:01:32,839 --> 00:01:36,468
I'm warning you. if you can't control
that bloody bird. it'll have to go.

7
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,353
But she's bored.

8
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:42,831
If I could only let her out
for an hour or two.

9
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,788
So you can send secret messages
to your freaky little friends? No. sir.

10
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,874
But I haven't had any messages
from any of my friends.

11
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:53,631
Not one...

12
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,438
...all summer.

13
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:58,716
Who would want to be
friends with you?

14
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,235
I should think you'd be
a little more grateful.

15
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:06,755
We've raised you since you were a baby.
given you the food off our table...

16
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,956
...even let you have
Dudley's second bedroom...

17
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,554
...purely out of the goodness
of our hearts.

18
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,110
Not now.
It's for when the Masons arrive.

19
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,472
Which should be any minute.

20
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,839
Now. let's go over our schedule
once again. shall we?

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,831
Petunia. when the Masons arrive.
you will be...?

22
00:02:22,999 --> 00:02:26,548
In the lounge. waiting to welcome
them graciously to our home.

23
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,474
-Good. And. Dudley. you will be...?
-|'|| be waiting to open the door.

24
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:32,470
Excellent.

25
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,592
And you?

26
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:43,357
I'll be in my bedroom. making no noise
and pretending that I don't exist.

27
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,158
Too right. you will.

28
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,676
With any luck. this could be the day
| make the biggest deal of my career...

29
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,230
...and you will not mess it up.

30
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:07,549
Harry Potter. such an honor it is.

31
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,029
-Who are you?
-Dobby. sir. Bobby the house-elf.

32
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,034
Not to be rude or anything...

33
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,988
...but this isn't a great time for me
to have a house-elf in my bedroom.

34
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,548
Yes. sir. Dobby understands.

35
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:26,711
It's just that Dobby
has come to tell you....

36
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,509
It is difficult. sir.
Dobby wonders where to begin.

37
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,232
-Why don't you sit down?
-Sit down? Sit down?

38
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:44,671
Dobby. I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to offend you or anything.

39
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,910
Offend Dobby?

40
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,310
Dobby has heard
of your greatness. sir...

41
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:55,032
...but never has he been asked
to sit down by a wizard. like an equal.

42
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:58,433
You can't have met
many decent wizards then.

43
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,909
No. I haven't.

44
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:03,718
That was an awful thing to say.

45
00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:07,669
-Bad Dobby! Bad Dobby!
-Stop. Dobby. Dobby. shush.

46
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,159
Dobby. please. stop.

47
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,994
Don't mind that. It's just the cat.

48
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,196
-Bad Dobby.
-Stop! Stop. Dobby. Please. be quiet.

49
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,555
Are you all right?

50
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,033
Dobby had to punish himself. sir.

51
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,272
Dobby almost spoke ill
of his family. sir.

52
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,228
-Your family?
-The wizard family Dobby serves. sir.

53
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,278
Dobby is bound to serve
one family forever.

54
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,874
If they ever knew Dobby was here....

55
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,992
But Dobby had to come. Dobby has
to protect Harry Potter. To warn him.

56
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,355
Harry Potter must not go back...

57
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:55,035
...to Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year.

58
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,149
There is a plot. a plot to make
most terrible things happen.

59
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:03,516
What terrible things?
Who's plotting them?

60
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,715
Can't say.

61
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:12,632
-Okay. I understand. You can't say.
-Don't make me talk. |--

62
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,151
-Dobby. Dobby. put the lamp down.
-Bad Dobby.

63
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:21,198
So when they arrive
at the ninth hole....

64
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,148
Give me the lamp.

65
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:30,108
Dobby. stop!

66
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:35,077
-Let me go.
-Get in there and keep quiet.

67
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,119
-What the devil are you doing up here?
-l was just--

68
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,919
You just ruined the punch line
of my Japanese golfer joke.

69
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:43,832
Sorry.

70
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:49,232
One more sound and you'll wish
you'd never been born. boy.

71
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,029
-And fix that door.
-Yes. sir.

72
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,798
See why I've got to go back?

73
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:00,554
I don't belong here.
I belong in your world. at Hogwarts.

74
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:05,156
-|t's the only place I've got friends.
-Friends who don't write to Harry Potter?

75
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:08,117
Well. I expect they've been....

76
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,751
Hang on. How do you know
my friends haven't been writing to me?

77
00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:16,151
Harry Potter mustn't
be angry with Bobby.

78
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,358
Dobby hoped if Harry Potter
thought his friends had forgotten him...

79
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:24,034
...Harry Potter might not want
to go back to school. sir.

80
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:29,390
-Give me those. Now.
-No!

81
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,351
Dobby. get back here.

82
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,597
Dobby. please. no.

83
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,753
Harry Potter must say
he's not going back to school.

84
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:57,434
I can't. Hogwarts is my home.

85
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:03,437
Then Dobby must do it. sir.
for Harry Potter's own good.

86
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,390
lt spread as far as the eye could see.
all over the floor of this building.

87
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,437
One plumber said.
“Look at all that water.“

88
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:13,477
The second plumber said.
“Yes. and that's just the top of it.“

89
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,673
I'm so sorry. It's my nephew.
He's very disturbed.

90
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,992
Meeting strangers upsets him.
That's why I kept him upstairs.

91
00:07:44,239 --> 00:07:46,594
You're never going back to that school.

92
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:51,595
You're never going to see those
freaky friends of yours again. Never!

93
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:36,948
Hiya. Harry.

94
00:08:37,999 --> 00:08:42,277
Ron. Fred. George.
What are you all doing here?

95
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:46,148
Rescuing you. of course.
Now. come on. get your trunk.

96
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,236
You better stand back.

97
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,676
Let's go.

98
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,071
-What was that?
-What was it?

99
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,395
Potter!

100
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,152
Dad. what's going on?

101
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,269
Go. Go. Go.

102
00:09:13,439 --> 00:09:14,428
Dad. hurry up.

103
00:09:16,199 --> 00:09:18,315
-Come on.
-Come on. Harry. hurry up.

104
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:21,951
Petunia. he's escaping!

105
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:25,512
-|'ve got you. Harry.
-Come here!

106
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,712
-Let go of me!
-No. boy!

107
00:09:27,879 --> 00:09:30,757
You and that bloody pigeon
aren't going anywhere.

108
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,478
-Get off!
-Drive!

109
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,436
-Right.
-Right!

110
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,192
No! No! No! No!

111
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,117
Dad!

112
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:52,312
Damn.

113
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:59,988
By the way. Harry. happy birthday.

114
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,958
Come on.

115
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,391
Okay. come on.

116
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,316
Okay. come on.

117
00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:46,112
-Think it'd be all right if we had some?
-Yeah. Mum will never know.

118
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,192
It's not much. but it's home.

119
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,555
I think it's brilliant.

120
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,875
Where have you been?

121
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:15,191
Harry. how wonderful
to see you. dear.

122
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,796
Beds empty. No note. Car gone.

123
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,837
You could have died.
You could have been seen.

124
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,914
Of course. I don't
blame you. Harry. dear.

125
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,992
They were starving him. Mum.
There were bars on his window.

126
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,711
Well. you best hope I don't put bars
on your window. Ronald Weasley.

127
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:34,915
Come on. Harry.
time for a spot of breakfast.

128
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:38,678
Here we are. Harry. Now. tuck in.

129
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:42,275
That's it. There we go.

130
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:46,115
-Mummy. have you seen my jumper?
-Yes. dear. it was on the cat.

131
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,272
Hello.

132
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,759
What did I do?

133
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:58,310
Ginny. She's been talking about you
all summer. A bit annoying. really.

134
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,994
-Morning. Weasleys.
-Morning. Dad.

135
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,515
-What a night. Nine raids. Nine!
-Raids?

136
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:09,474
Dad works in the Ministry of Magic.
in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.

137
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,837
Dad loves Muggles.
thinks they're fascinating.

138
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,116
Well. now.

139
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,108
And who are you?

140
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:22,269
Sorry. sir. l'm Harry. sir.
Harry Potter.

141
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,433
Good Lord. Are you really?

142
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:30,111
Well, Ron has told us all about you.
of course. When did he get here?

143
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:31,712
This morning.

144
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,875
Your sons flew that enchanted car
of yours to Surrey and back last night.

145
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,351
Did you really? How did it go?

146
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:45,150
I mean-- That was very wrong
indeed. boys. Very wrong of you.

147
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,115
Now. Harry. you must know
all about Muggles.

148
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,239
Tell me. what exactly
is the function of a rubber duck?

149
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,278
Well. that'll be Errol with the post.

150
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,473
Fetch it. will you. Percy. please?

151
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,872
-Erro|.
-He's always doing that.

152
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,268
Look. it's our Hogwarts letters.
They've sent us Harry's as well.

153
00:13:18,439 --> 00:13:21,351
Dumbledore must know you're here.
Doesn't miss a trick. that man.

154
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,396
-No.
-This lot won't come cheap.

155
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,712
-The spell books alone are expensive.
-We'l| manage.

156
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,473
There's only one place we're going to
get all of this. Diagon Alley.

157
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,999
Right.

158
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:37,195
Here we are. Harry.
You go first. dear.

159
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,193
But Harry's never traveled
by Floo powder before. Mum.

160
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,349
Floo powder?

161
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,637
You go first. Ron. so that Harry
can see how it's done. Yes.

162
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,037
ln you go.

163
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,993
That's it.

164
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,998
Diagon Alley.

165
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:04,155
You see? It's quite easy. dear.
Don't be afraid. Come on.

166
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,989
Come on.

167
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,232
ln you go. That's it. Mind your head.

168
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,675
That's right.
Now. take your Floo powder.

169
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,515
That's it. very good.

170
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,832
Now. don't forget to speak
very. very clearly.

171
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,875
Diagonally.

172
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,388
-What did he say. dear?
-Diagona|ly.

173
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,595
I thought he did.

174
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:03,150
-Not lost. are you. my dear?
-|'m fine. thank you. l was just going....

175
00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:07,631
Come with us. We'll help you
find your way back.

176
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:10,389
-No. Please--
-Harry?

177
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,595
Hagrid!

178
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,637
What do you think
you're doing down here? Come on.

179
00:16:20,199 --> 00:16:25,227
You're a mess. Harry. Skulking around
Knockturn Alley? Dodgy place.

180
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:29,233
Don't want no one to see you there.
People will think you're up to no good.

181
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:31,549
l was lost. |--

182
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,553
Hang on. What were you
doing down there then?

183
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,635
Me? l was.... I was looking
for Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.

184
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,598
They're ruining all the school cabbages.

185
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,870
Harry. Hagrid.

186
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,432
Hello. Hermione.

187
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:54,313
-|t's so good to see you.
-|t's great to see you too.

188
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,427
What did you do to your glasses?

189
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,352
Oculus Repam.

190
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,319
I definitely need to remember that one.

191
00:17:06,479 --> 00:17:10,028
You'll be all right now then. Harry?
Right. I'll leave you to it.

192
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:11,598
-Okay. bye.
-Thank you. Bye.

193
00:17:11,879 --> 00:17:13,676
Come on. everyone's been so worried.

194
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,029
Harry.

195
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,271
Thank goodness. We'd hoped
you'd only gone one grate too far.

196
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:31,158
Ladies and gentlemen.
Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart.

197
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:33,514
Here he is.

198
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:38,917
Mum fancies him.

199
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,197
Make way there. please.
Let me by. madam. Thank you.

200
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,676
Excuse me. little girl.
This is for the Daily Prophet.

201
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,432
It can't be. Harry Potter?

202
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,716
Harry Potter!

203
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,029
Excuse me. madam.

204
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:02,634
Nice big smile. Harry.
Together. you and | rate the front page.

205
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,836
Ladies and gentlemen.
what an extraordinary moment this is.

206
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,277
When young Harry stepped
into Flourish and Blotts this morning...

207
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,353
...to purchase my autobiography.
Magical Me. ..

208
00:18:16,719 --> 00:18:19,472
...which. incidentally.
is currently celebrating...

209
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,270
...its 27th week atop
the Daily Prophet bestseller list...

210
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:28,752
...he had no idea that he would.
in fact. be leaving...

211
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,590
...with my entire collected works...

212
00:18:35,159 --> 00:18:37,275
...free of charge.

213
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,510
Now. ladies?

214
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,712
Harry. now you give me those.
and I'll get them signed.

215
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,236
All of you wait outside.
That's it.

216
00:18:57,159 --> 00:18:59,548
I'll bet you loved that.
didn't you. Potter?

217
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:04,032
Famous Harry Potter. Can't go into a
bookshop without making the front page.

218
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,278
Leave him alone.

219
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,796
Look. Potter.
You've got yourself a girlfriend.

220
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:13,838
Now. now. Draco. play nicely.

221
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,389
Mr. Potter.

222
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,548
Lucius Malfoy. We meet at last.

223
00:19:21,719 --> 00:19:23,835
Forgive me.

224
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:27,115
Your scar is legend.

225
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,790
As. of course. is the wizard
who gave it to you.

226
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,190
Voldemort killed my parents.

227
00:19:34,199 --> 00:19:37,509
He was nothing more than a murderer.

228
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,318
You must be very brave
to mention his name.

229
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,234
Or very foolish.

230
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:47,030
Fear of a name only increases
fear of the thing itself.

231
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,711
And you must be Miss Granger.

232
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,558
Yes. Draco has told me
all about you. And your parents.

233
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,310
Muggles. aren't they?

234
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:14,028
Let me see.
Red hair. vacant expressions...

235
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,597
...tatty. secondhand book.

236
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,996
You must be the Weasleys.

237
00:20:22,439 --> 00:20:24,350
lt's mad in here.
Let's go outside.

238
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,069
-Well. well. well. Weasley senior.
-Lucius.

239
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:32,750
Busy time at the Ministry. Arthur.
all those extra raids?

240
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:35,149
I do hope they're paying you overtime...

241
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:38,356
...but judging by the state of this.
I'd say not.

242
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:43,674
What's the use in being a disgrace
to the name of wizard...

243
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,831
...if they don't even pay you well for it?

244
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:50,909
We have a very different idea about what
disgraces the name of wizard. Malfoy.

245
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:52,877
Clearly.

246
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:58,428
Associating with Muggles.

247
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,871
And I thought your family
could sink no lower.

248
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:12,712
I'll see you at work.

249
00:21:16,719 --> 00:21:18,949
See you at school.

250
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,040
40:58. come on.
-The train will be leaving any moment.

251
00:21:29,199 --> 00:21:32,350
Fred. George. Percy. you first.

252
00:21:37,719 --> 00:21:39,277
Okay.

253
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,752
After you. dear.

254
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:51,911
Come on. Ginny.
we'll get you a seat. Hurry.

255
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:55,150
Let's go.

256
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,557
-What do you two think you're doing?
-Sorry.

257
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,838
Lost control of the trolley.

258
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:18,349
-Why can't we get through?
-I don't know.

259
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:21,751
The gateway has sealed
itself for some reason.

260
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:26,833
The train leaves at exactly 11:00.
We've missed it.

261
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,231
Harry. if we can't get through...

262
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,080
...maybe Mum and Dad can't get back.

263
00:22:33,999 --> 00:22:37,309
Maybe we should just go
and wait by the car.

264
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:39,593
The car.

265
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,710
Ron. I should tell you...

266
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,509
...most Muggles aren't accustomed
to seeing a flying car.

267
00:22:56,679 --> 00:22:57,714
Right.

268
00:22:57,999 --> 00:22:58,988
Okay.

269
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,751
Oh. no! The Invisibility Booster
must be faulty.

270
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:22,191
Come on. then. Let's go lower.
We need to find the train.

271
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,587
Okay.

272
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,035
All we need to do is catch up
with the train.

273
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,792
We can't be far behind.

274
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:42,313
-Do you hear that?
-We must be getting close.

275
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:44,749
Hold on.

276
00:24:09,999 --> 00:24:12,069
Harry!

277
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,352
Hold on!

278
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:21,948
Take my hand!

279
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:27,233
Hold on!

280
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,836
I'm trying. Your hand's all sweaty.

281
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:46,070
-I think we found the train.
-Yeah.

282
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,274
Welcome home.

283
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:19,908
Up! Up!

284
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:22,909
It's not working!

285
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,147
Up! Ron. mind that tree!

286
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,316
Stop! Stop! Stop!

287
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,917
-My wand. Look at my wand.
-Be thankful it's not your neck.

288
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,358
-What's happening?
-I don't know.

289
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,396
Come on. go! Fast!

290
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,033
Scabbers. you're okay.

291
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,436
The car!

292
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,032
Dad's gonna kill me.

293
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,470
See you. Hedwig.

294
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:50,989
So a house-elf shows up
in my bedroom...

295
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,993
...we can't get through the barrier
to platform 9 3/4...

296
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,277
...we almost get killed by a tree....

297
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,830
Clearly someone doesn't want me
here this year.

298
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:07,112
Well. take a good look. lads.

299
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:11,033
This night might well be
the last you spend in this castle.

300
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,076
Oh. dear. we are in trouble.

301
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:23,276
You were seen by no less
than seven Muggles.

302
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,359
Do you have any idea
how serious this is?

303
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,715
You have risked
the exposure of our world.

304
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,158
Not to mention the damage you
inflicted on a Whomping Willow...

305
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:37,356
...that's been on these grounds
since before you were born.

306
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:41,189
Honestly. Professor Snape.
I think it did more damage to us.

307
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,475
Silence.

308
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:50,508
I assure you that were you in Slytherin.
and your fate rested with me...

309
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:54,309
...the both of you would be
on the train home tonight.

310
00:28:55,439 --> 00:28:57,589
-As it is--
-They are not.

311
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:03,599
Professor Dumbledore.
Professor McGonagall.

312
00:29:03,959 --> 00:29:05,392
Headmaster...

313
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:10,156
...these boys have flouted the Decree
for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry.

314
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:14,073
-As such--
-I am well aware of our bylaws...

315
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,993
...having written
quite a few of them myself.

316
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,432
However. as head of Gryffindor house...

317
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:25,390
...it is for Professor McGonagall
to determine the appropriate action.

318
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,910
We'll go and get our stuff. then.

319
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:30,434
What are you
talking about. Mr. Weasley?

320
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,716
You're going to expel us. aren't you?

321
00:29:34,199 --> 00:29:37,191
Not today. Mr. Weasley...

322
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:42,150
...but I must impress on both of you
the seriousness of what you have done.

323
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:47,117
I will be writing to your families tonight.
and you will both receive detention.

324
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,869
Morning. everyone.

325
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:15,953
-Good morning. everyone.
-Good morning. Professor Sprout.

326
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:20,237
Welcome to Greenhouse Three.
second years. Gather around. everyone.

327
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,118
Today we're going to re-pot Mandrakes.

328
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:27,113
Who here can tell me
the properties of the Mandrake root?

329
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,032
Yes. Miss Granger?

330
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,430
Mandrake. or Mandragora. ..

331
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,390
...is used to return those who have been
Petrified to their original state.

332
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:41,350
It's also dangerous. The Mandrake's
cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.

333
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,239
Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor.

334
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,959
As our Mandrakes
are still only seedlings...

335
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:48,950
...their cries won't kill you yet.

336
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:52,748
But they could knock you out for hours.
which is why I have given you earmuffs...

337
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,353
...for auditory protection.

338
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:58,798
So could you please put them on.
right away? Ouickly.

339
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,633
Flaps tight down.
and watch me closely.

340
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:04,677
You grasp your Mandrake firmly.

341
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,718
You pull it sharply up out of the pot.

342
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,631
Got it? And...

343
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,876
...now you dunk it down
into the other pot...

344
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:20,555
...and pour a little sprinkling of soil
to keep him warm.

345
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,112
Longbottom's been neglecting
his earmuffs.

346
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:31,399
-No. ma'am. he's just fainted.
-Yes. well. just leave him there.

347
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:35,149
Right. on we go.
Plenty of pots to go around.

348
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,756
Grasp your Mandrake and pull it up.

349
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,709
-There's Nearly Headless Nick.
-He||o. Percy. Miss Clearwater.

350
00:31:56,879 --> 00:31:59,313
Hello. Sir Nicholas.

351
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,471
Say it. I'm doomed.

352
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:16,110
-You're doomed.
-Hi. Harry.

353
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,874
l'm Colin Creevey. I'm in Gryffindor too.

354
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,598
Hi. Colin. Nice to meet you.

355
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:24,871
Ron. is that your owl?

356
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:41,559
Bloody bird's a menace.

357
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,033
Oh. no.

358
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,510
Look. everyone.
Weasley's got himself a Howler.

359
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,947
Go on. Ron. I ignored one
from my gran once. It was horrible.

360
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:05,636
Ronald Weasley!

361
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:13,995
How dare you steal that car!
I am absolutely disgusted!

362
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:16,747
Your father's now facing
an inquiry at work...

363
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,195
...and it's entirely your fault!

364
00:33:19,639 --> 00:33:23,348
I! you put another toe out of line...

365
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,637
we 7! bring you straight home!

366
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,756
And, Ginny, dear, congratulations
on making Gryffindor.

367
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:34,468
Your father and I are so proud.

368
00:33:51,999 --> 00:33:58,154
Let me introduce you to your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

369
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,799
Me.

370
00:33:59,959 --> 00:34:02,393
Gilderoy Lockhart...

371
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,710
...Order of Merlin. Third Class...

372
00:34:05,879 --> 00:34:09,076
...honorary member
of the Dark Force Defense League...

373
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:12,037
...and five times winner...

374
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:17,992
...of Witch Weekly's
Most-Charming-Smile Award.

375
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,793
But I don't talk about that.

376
00:34:19,959 --> 00:34:24,316
I didn't get rid of the Bandon Banshee
by smiling at him.

377
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,639
Now. be warned.

378
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,876
It is my job to arm you...

379
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:38,159
...against the foulest creatures
known to wizardkind.

380
00:34:38,959 --> 00:34:42,395
You may find yourselves facing
your worst fears in this room.

381
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,439
Know only that no harm
can befall you whilst I am here.

382
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:49,397
I must ask you not to scream.

383
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,028
It might provoke them.

384
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,839
Cornish pixies?

385
00:34:56,999 --> 00:34:59,911
Freshly caught Cornish pixies.

386
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,716
Laugh if you will. Mr. Finnegan...

387
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,873
...but pixies can be
devilishly tricky little blighters.

388
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,838
Let's see what you make of them.

389
00:35:13,999 --> 00:35:17,116
Come on now. round them up.
They're only pixies.

390
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:36,198
-You just stay there!
-Please. get me down!

391
00:35:38,439 --> 00:35:40,794
-Get off me!
-Stop. Hold still!

392
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:45,432
Peskipilrsi Pes ternoIni!

393
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:08,718
I'll ask you three to just nip
the rest of them back into their cage.

394
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,470
What do we do now?

395
00:36:13,879 --> 00:36:15,312
IInInoh ulus !

396
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,590
Why is it always me?

397
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:35,274
I spent the summer devising
a whole new Ouidditch program.

398
00:36:35,439 --> 00:36:38,954
We're gonna train earlier.
harder and longer.

399
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,270
What--? I don't believe it.

400
00:36:44,959 --> 00:36:47,553
-Where you think you're going. Flint?
-Ouidditch practice.

401
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:51,917
-I booked the pitch for Gryffindor today.
-Easy. Wood. I've got a note.

402
00:36:53,279 --> 00:36:55,395
| smell trouble.

403
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,350
“|. Professor Severus Snape.
do hereby give the Slytherin team...

404
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:02,875
...permission to practice today. owing
to the need to train their new Seeker.“

405
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:05,599
You've got a new Seeker. Who?

406
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,914
-Ma|foy?
-That's right.

407
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,752
And that's not all
that's new this year.

408
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,836
Those are Nimbus 2001s.
How did you get those?

409
00:37:18,999 --> 00:37:20,990
A gift from Draco's father.

410
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,755
You see. Weasley. unlike some.
my father can afford the best.

411
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,798
At least no one on the Gryffindor team
had to buy their way in.

412
00:37:27,959 --> 00:37:30,757
They got in on pure talent.

413
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:37,549
No one asked your opinion.
you filthy little Mudblood.

414
00:37:39,959 --> 00:37:43,269
You'll pay for that one. Malfoy.
Eat slugs!

415
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:52,316
You okay. Ron?

416
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:56,917
Say something.

417
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:07,232
-Wow! Can you turn him around. Harry?
-No. Colin. get out of the way.

418
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,076
Let's take him to Hagrid's.

419
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:12,275
He'll know what to do.

420
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:24,030
This calls for
a specialist's equipment.

421
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,076
Nothing to do but wait till it stops.
I'm afraid.

422
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,757
-Okay.
-Better out than in.

423
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:40,440
-Who was Ron trying to curse. anyway?
-Ma|foy. He called Hermione....

424
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,876
Well. I don't know
exactly what it means.

425
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,796
He called me a Mudblood.

426
00:38:50,959 --> 00:38:53,519
-He did not.
-What's a Mudblood?

427
00:38:53,879 --> 00:38:58,236
It means “dirty blood.“ Mudblood's a foul
name for someone who's Muggle-born.

428
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,473
Someone with non-magic parents.
Someone like me.

429
00:39:02,959 --> 00:39:06,918
It's not a term one usually hears
in civilized conversation.

430
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:12,635
See. the thing is. Harry. there are
some wizards. like the Malfoy family...

431
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,271
...who think they're better than everyone
else because they're pure-blood.

432
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:18,997
That's horrible.

433
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,154
lt's disgusting.

434
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,676
And it's codswallop to boot.
Dirty blood.

435
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:30,070
Why. there isn't a wizard alive today
that's not half-blood or less.

436
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:34,596
More to the point. they've yet to think
of a spell that our Hermione can't do.

437
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,876
Come here.

438
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:44,149
Don't you think on it. Hermione.
Don't you think on it for one minute.

439
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,512
Harry. Harry. Harry.

440
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,830
Can you possibly imagine...

441
00:39:56,999 --> 00:40:00,071
...a better way to serve detention...

442
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,274
...than by helping me
to answer my fan mail?

443
00:40:03,439 --> 00:40:04,792
Not really.

444
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:11,069
Fame is a fickle friend. Harry.
Celebrity is as celebrity does.

445
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:13,070
Remember that.

446
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,750
Come.

447
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,956
Come. . .

448
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,913
...to me.

449
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,513
-What?
-Sorry?

450
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,557
That voice.

451
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,199
Voice?

452
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:44,037
-Didn't you hear it?
-What are you talking about. Harry?

453
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,076
I think you're getting
a bit drowsy.

454
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:52,152
And great Scott. no wonder. Look at the
time. We've been here nearly four hours.

455
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,671
Spooky how the time flies
when one is having fun.

456
00:41:00,439 --> 00:41:02,873
Spooky.

457
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,836
Bio o d.

458
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:11,389
I smell blood.

459
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,518
Let me rip you.

460
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,116
Let me kill you.

461
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,279
Kill!

462
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,434
K ill!

463
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,951
-I(ill!
-Harry!

464
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,509
-Did you hear it?
-Hear what?

465
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,956
-That voice.
-Voice? What voice?

466
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:35,908
I heard it first in Lockhart's office.
And then again just--

467
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:38,190
It 's time.

468
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:41,432
lt's moving.
I think it's going to kill.

469
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:46,148
-Ki||?
-Harry. wait! Not so fast!

470
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,671
Strange.

471
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:17,472
-|'ve never seen spiders act like that.
-I don't like spiders.

472
00:42:21,439 --> 00:42:23,395
What's that?

473
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:31,077
“The Chamber of Secrets has been
opened. Enemies of the Heir. beware.“

474
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,390
It's written in blood.

475
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:38,269
Oh. no.

476
00:42:42,799 --> 00:42:44,994
lt's Filch's cat.

477
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:47,674
lt's Mrs. Norris.

478
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,674
“Enemies of the Heir. beware.“

479
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:09,394
You'll be next. Mudbloods.

480
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:14,509
What's going on here?
Go on. Make way. make way.

481
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,672
Potter?

482
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,876
What are you...?

483
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:25,274
Mrs. Norris?

484
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:30,713
-You've murdered my cat.
-No. No.

485
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:32,307
I'll kill you.

486
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,279
-|'|| kill you!
-Argus!

487
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,670
Argus. l....

488
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:47,037
Everyone will proceed
to their dormitories immediately.

489
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,631
Everyone except...

490
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,516
...you three.

491
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,199
Ravenclaws. follow me.

492
00:43:58,999 --> 00:44:02,708
She's not dead. Argus.
She has been Petrified.

493
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,599
Thought so.
So unlucky I wasn't there.

494
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,832
I know exactly the countercurse
that could've spared her.

495
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:13,593
But how she has been Petrified.
I cannot say.

496
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,434
Ask him.
It's him that's done it.

497
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,194
You saw what he wrote on the wall.

498
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:23,273
It's not true. sir. I swear.
I never touched Mrs. Norris.

499
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,718
-Rubbish.
-If I might. headmaster?

500
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,756
Perhaps Potter and his friends were just
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

501
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:35,070
However...

502
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,233
...the circumstances are suspicious.

503
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,837
l. for one. don't recall
seeing Potter at dinner.

504
00:44:42,999 --> 00:44:45,149
I'm afraid that's my doing. Severus.

505
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:48,596
You see. Harry was helping me
answer my fan mail.

506
00:44:48,759 --> 00:44:51,910
That's why Ron and I
went looking for him. professor.

507
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,718
We'd just found him when he said....

508
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,555
-Yes. Miss Granger?
-When I said I wasn't hungry.

509
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:05,714
We were heading back to the common
room when we found Mrs. Norris.

510
00:45:07,959 --> 00:45:13,272
-|nnocent until proven guilty. Severus.
-My cat has been Petrified.

511
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:19,676
-I want to see some punishment!
-We will be able to cure her. Argus.

512
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:25,156
As I understand it. Madam Sprout
has a very healthy growth of Mandrake.

513
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:29,552
When matured. a potion will be made
which will revive Mrs. Norris.

514
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:31,518
And in the meantime...

515
00:45:32,039 --> 00:45:35,873
...I strongly recommend caution...

516
00:45:36,519 --> 00:45:38,430
...to all.

517
00:45:48,999 --> 00:45:52,309
-|t's a bit strange. isn't it?
-Strange?

518
00:45:52,479 --> 00:45:55,118
You hear this voice.
a voice only you can hear...

519
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,796
...and then Mrs. Norris turns up
Petrified. It's just strange.

520
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:03,077
Do you think I should have told them?
Dumbledore and the others. I mean?

521
00:46:03,239 --> 00:46:04,638
Are you mad?

522
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:10,079
No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world.
hearing voices isn't a good sign.

523
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,355
She's right. you know.

524
00:46:18,519 --> 00:46:20,749
Could I have your attention.
please?

525
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:26,559
Right. Now. today.
we will be transforming animals...

526
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:28,994
...into water goblets.

527
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,472
Like so.

528
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:36,350
One. two. three.
Vera Verto.

529
00:46:39,759 --> 00:46:43,513
Now it's your turn.
Who would like to go first?

530
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:48,835
Mr. Weasley.
“One. two. three. Vera Verto.“

531
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,271
Vera Verto!

532
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,720
That wand needs replacing.
Mr. Weasley.

533
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,070
-Yes. Miss Granger?
-Professor. ..

534
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:10,278
...l was wondering if you could tell us
about the Chamber of Secrets.

535
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:17,393
Very well.

536
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:20,750
You all know. of course...

537
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:24,629
...that Hogwarts was founded
over a thousand years ago...

538
00:47:24,799 --> 00:47:29,031
...by the four greatest witches
and wizards of the age:

539
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:32,794
Godric Gryffindor.
Helga Hufflepuff...

540
00:47:32,959 --> 00:47:38,352
...Rowena Ravenclaw
and Salazar Slytherin.

541
00:47:38,999 --> 00:47:44,756
Now. three of the founders
coexisted quite harmoniously.

542
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,832
-One did not.
-Three guesses who.

543
00:47:48,519 --> 00:47:50,874
Salazar Slytherin wished to be
more selective...

544
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,077
...about the students admitted
to Hogwarts.

545
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:58,630
He believed magical learning should
be kept within all-magic families.

546
00:47:58,799 --> 00:48:00,835
In other words. pure-bloods.

547
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:06,319
Unable to sway the others.
he decided to leave the school.

548
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:09,270
Now. according to legend...

549
00:48:09,439 --> 00:48:12,988
...Slytherin had built
a hidden chamber in this castle...

550
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:16,675
...known as the Chamber of Secrets.

551
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:21,072
Though. shortly before departing.
he sealed it...

552
00:48:21,239 --> 00:48:25,198
...until that time when his own
true Heir returned to the school.

553
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,635
The Heir alone...

554
00:48:27,799 --> 00:48:30,359
...would be able to open the Chamber...

555
00:48:30,519 --> 00:48:35,070
...and unleash the horror within.
and by so doing...

556
00:48:35,239 --> 00:48:38,470
...purge the school
of all those who...

557
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:43,429
...in Slytherin's view.
were unworthy to study magic.

558
00:48:44,039 --> 00:48:46,075
Muggle-borns.

559
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:50,550
Naturally. the school
has been searched many times.

560
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:54,029
No such chamber has been found.

561
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:59,070
Professor? What exactly does legend
tell us lies within the Chamber?

562
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,348
The Chamber is said to be home
to something...

563
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:05,955
...that only the Heir of Slytherin
can control.

564
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,029
It is said to be the home...

565
00:49:10,199 --> 00:49:11,757
...of a monster.

566
00:49:17,279 --> 00:49:20,794
Do you think it's true? Do you think
there really is a Chamber of Secrets?

567
00:49:20,959 --> 00:49:24,998
Yes. Couldn't you tell? McGonagall's
worried. All the teachers are.

568
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:28,835
If there really is a Chamber of Secrets.
and it has been opened. that means--

569
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:32,787
The Heir of Slytherin has returned
to Hogwarts. The question is. who is it?

570
00:49:32,959 --> 00:49:37,157
Let's think. Who do we know who
thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?

571
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,880
-If you're talking about Malfoy--
-Of course. You heard him.

572
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,678
“You'll be next. Mudbloods.“

573
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:44,354
I heard him.
But Malfoy. the Heir of Slytherin?

574
00:49:44,519 --> 00:49:47,556
Maybe Ron's right. Hermione.
I mean. look at his family.

575
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:50,393
The whole lot of them have been
in Slytherin for centuries.

576
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:53,835
Crabbe and Goyle must know.
Maybe we could trick them into telling.

577
00:49:54,279 --> 00:49:58,272
Even they aren't that thick.
But there might be another way.

578
00:49:58,439 --> 00:50:00,191
Mind you. it would be difficult.

579
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:03,272
Not to mention we'd be breaking
about 50 school rules...

580
00:50:03,439 --> 00:50:07,717
...and it'll be dangerous.
Very dangerous.

581
00:50:14,279 --> 00:50:16,634
Here it is.
The Polyjuice Potion.

582
00:50:16,799 --> 00:50:19,393
“Properly brewed. the Polyjuice Potion
allows the drinker...

583
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:23,632
...to transform himself temporarily
into the physical form of another.“

584
00:50:23,799 --> 00:50:27,428
You mean if Harry and | drink that stuff.
we'll turn into Crabbe and Goyle?

585
00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:30,830
-Wicked! Malfoy will tell us anything.
-Exactly.

586
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,709
But it's tricky. I've never seen
a more complicated potion.

587
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:37,838
-How long will it take to make?
-A month.

588
00:50:38,199 --> 00:50:39,598
A month?

589
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,435
But. Hermione.
if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin...

590
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,672
...he could attack half
the Muggle-borns in the school by then.

591
00:50:46,839 --> 00:50:48,670
I know.

592
00:50:48,839 --> 00:50:51,558
But it's the only plan we've got.

593
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:41,793
Another goal for Slytherin!

594
00:51:43,159 --> 00:51:46,310
They lead Gryffindor 90 to 30.

595
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,953
Yeah!

596
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:50,917
Yeah!

597
00:52:14,159 --> 00:52:16,389
All right there. Scarhead?

598
00:52:22,279 --> 00:52:24,668
Watch yourself. Harry!

599
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,758
Wood. look out!

600
00:52:39,879 --> 00:52:42,598
Blimey! Harry's got himself
a rogue Bludger.

601
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:44,431
That's been tampered with. that has.

602
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:46,428
I'll stop it.

603
00:52:46,599 --> 00:52:50,990
No! Even with a proper wand.
it's too risky. You could hit Harry.

604
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,508
Training for the ballet. Potter?

605
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,356
You'll never catch me. Potter.

606
00:55:16,439 --> 00:55:17,474
Let's go.

607
00:55:17,639 --> 00:55:22,633
Harry Potter has caught the Snitch.
Gryffindor wins!

608
00:55:28,679 --> 00:55:30,635
Finite Incan ta tem!

609
00:55:37,439 --> 00:55:38,713
-Thank you.
-Are you okay?

610
00:55:38,879 --> 00:55:40,870
No. I think my arm is broken.

611
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:44,668
Not to worry. Harry. I will fix
that arm of yours straightaway.

612
00:55:44,839 --> 00:55:47,672
-Not you.
-Boy doesn't know what he's saying.

613
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:51,230
This won't hurt a bit.

614
00:55:57,079 --> 00:55:59,957
Brackium Emendo!

615
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,638
Yes. well.
that can sometimes happen...

616
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,950
...but the point is...

617
00:56:14,279 --> 00:56:18,238
...you can no longer feel any pain. and.
very clearly. the bones are not broken.

618
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,960
Broken? There's no bones left.

619
00:56:22,599 --> 00:56:24,476
Much more flexible. though.

620
00:56:26,839 --> 00:56:30,593
Mr. Malfoy. stop making such a fuss.
You can go. Out of my way.

621
00:56:30,759 --> 00:56:32,636
Should have been brought
straight to me.

622
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:35,233
I can mend bones in a heartbeat.
but growing them back....

623
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,833
You will be able to. won't you?

624
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,992
I'll be able to. certainly.
But it'll be painful.

625
00:56:40,599 --> 00:56:45,070
You're in for a rough night. Potter.
Regrowing bones is a nasty business.

626
00:56:47,879 --> 00:56:50,757
What do you expect?
Pumpkin juice?

627
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,792
Kill.

628
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,079
Kill.

629
00:57:06,239 --> 00:57:09,311
Time to kill.

630
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:16,188
Hello.

631
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:18,909
Dobby?

632
00:57:19,079 --> 00:57:21,309
Harry Potter should have listened
to Dobby.

633
00:57:21,759 --> 00:57:25,308
Harry Potter should have gone back home
when he missed the train.

634
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:29,917
It was you. You stopped the barrier
from letting Ron and me through.

635
00:57:30,199 --> 00:57:33,032
lndeed. Yes. sir.

636
00:57:33,999 --> 00:57:38,834
-You nearly got Ron and me expelled.
-At least you would be away from here.

637
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,560
Harry Potter must go home.

638
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:45,156
Dobby thought his Bludger would be
enough to make Harry Potter see--

639
00:57:45,319 --> 00:57:48,550
Your Bludger? You made
that Bludger chase after me?

640
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:52,156
Dobby feels most aggrieved. sir.

641
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:55,790
Dobby had to iron his hands.

642
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:02,311
You better clear off before my bones
come back. or I might strangle you.

643
00:58:04,839 --> 00:58:06,750
Dobby is used to death threats. sir.

644
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,832
Dobby gets them five times a day
at home.

645
00:58:09,999 --> 00:58:12,672
I don't suppose you could tell me
why you're trying to kill me?

646
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:16,669
Not kill you. sir.
Never kill you.

647
00:58:16,839 --> 00:58:20,036
Dobby remembers how it was
before Harry Potter triumphed...

648
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:23,192
...over He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.

649
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:26,909
We house-elves were
treated like vermin. sir.

650
00:58:27,079 --> 00:58:32,278
Of course. Dobby is still
treated like vermin.

651
00:58:41,239 --> 00:58:43,753
Why do you wear that thing. Dobby?

652
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:48,835
This. sir? It is a mark
of the house-elf's enslavement.

653
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:53,915
Dobby can only be freed if his master
presents him with clothes.

654
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,279
Listen.

655
00:58:57,439 --> 00:58:58,918
Listen!

656
00:58:59,079 --> 00:59:02,628
Terrible things are
about to happen at Hogwarts.

657
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:05,594
Harry Potter must not stay here...

658
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:10,117
...now that history
is to repeat itself.

659
00:59:10,279 --> 00:59:13,589
Repeat itself? You mean
this has happened before?

660
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,671
I shouldn't have said that.

661
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:22,277
-Bad Dobby! Bad!
-Stop it!

662
00:59:22,439 --> 00:59:24,031
Stop it. Dobby!

663
00:59:25,639 --> 00:59:29,314
Tell me. When did this happen before?
Who's doing it now?

664
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:34,474
Dobby cannot say. sir. Dobby
only wants Harry Potter to be safe.

665
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,438
No. Dobby. Tell me.
Who is it?

666
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:49,835
Put him here.

667
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:57,037
-What happened?
-There's been another attack.

668
00:59:57,199 --> 01:00:02,751
I think he's been Petrified.
Madam Pomfrey.

669
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:08,036
Look. Perhaps he managed
to take a picture of his attacker.

670
01:00:15,799 --> 01:00:18,438
What can this mean. Albus?

671
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,477
It means...

672
01:00:20,839 --> 01:00:23,478
...that our students
are in great danger.

673
01:00:23,639 --> 01:00:26,915
-What should I tell the staff?
-The truth.

674
01:00:27,159 --> 01:00:30,788
Tell them Hogwarts
is no longer safe.

675
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:33,953
It is as we feared. Minerva.

676
01:00:34,199 --> 01:00:38,556
The Chamber of Secrets
has indeed been opened again.

677
01:00:41,279 --> 01:00:45,238
Again? You mean the Chamber
of Secrets has been opened before?

678
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:48,039
Of course.
Don't you see?

679
01:00:48,199 --> 01:00:51,077
Lucius Malfoy must have opened it
when he was at school here.

680
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:54,148
-Now he's taught Draco how to do it.
-Maybe.

681
01:00:54,319 --> 01:00:57,356
We'll have to wait for
the Polyjuice Potion to know for sure.

682
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:01,308
Enlighten me. Why are we brewing
this potion in broad daylight...

683
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:05,268
...in the middle of the girls' lavatory?
Don't you think we'll get caught?

684
01:01:06,119 --> 01:01:08,679
No. No one ever comes in here.

685
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:11,914
-Why?
-Moaning Myrtle.

686
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:13,957
Who?

687
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,032
Moaning Myrtle.

688
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:19,516
-Who's Moaning Myrtle?
-|'m Moaning Myrtle.

689
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:27,475
I wouldn't expect you to know me.

690
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:30,552
Who would ever talk
about ugly. miserable...

691
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:33,950
...moping Moaning Myrtle?

692
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:42,916
She's a little sensitive.

693
01:01:47,239 --> 01:01:49,116
Gather round!

694
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:54,230
Gather round.
Can everybody see me?

695
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:57,392
Can you all hear me?

696
01:01:58,039 --> 01:01:59,313
Excellent.

697
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:03,348
In light of the dark events
of recent weeks...

698
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:07,991
...Professor Dumbledore has granted me
permission to start this Dueling Club...

699
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:12,631
...to train you all up in case
you ever need to defend yourselves...

700
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:15,314
...as I myself have done
on countless occasions.

701
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:19,035
For full details.
see my published works.

702
01:02:23,559 --> 01:02:26,551
Let me introduce my assistant...

703
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:29,234
...Professor Snape.

704
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:35,113
He has sportingly agreed to help
with a short demonstration.

705
01:02:35,279 --> 01:02:37,235
I don't want any of you
youngsters to worry.

706
01:02:37,399 --> 01:02:42,109
You'll still have your Potions master
when I'm through with him. Never fear.

707
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,678
One.

708
01:02:58,840 --> 01:02:59,829
Two.

709
01:03:00,599 --> 01:03:03,511
-T hree!
-Exp elliarmus!

710
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,320
-Do you think he's all right?
-Who cares?

711
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:17,313
An excellent idea to show them that.
Professor Snape...

712
01:03:17,479 --> 01:03:21,836
...but if you don't mind me saying. it was
obvious what you were about to do.

713
01:03:21,999 --> 01:03:25,116
If I had wanted to stop you.
it would have been only too easy.

714
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:28,590
Perhaps it would be prudent
to first teach the students...

715
01:03:28,759 --> 01:03:33,071
...to block unfriendly spells.
professor.

716
01:03:34,759 --> 01:03:37,068
An excellent suggestion.
Professor Snape.

717
01:03:38,279 --> 01:03:42,352
Let's have a volunteer pair.
Potter. Weasley. how about you?

718
01:03:42,519 --> 01:03:45,875
Weasley's wand causes devastation
with the simplest spells.

719
01:03:46,279 --> 01:03:49,828
We'll be sending Potter
to the hospital wing in a matchbox.

720
01:03:49,999 --> 01:03:53,912
Might I suggest someone
from my own house?

721
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:57,509
Malfoy. perhaps?

722
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:07,109
-Good luck. Potter.
-Thank you. sir.

723
01:04:14,759 --> 01:04:16,670
Wands at the ready.

724
01:04:17,239 --> 01:04:20,117
-Scared. Potter?
-You wish.

725
01:04:30,119 --> 01:04:31,757
On the count of three...

726
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:36,072
...cast your charms to disarm
your opponent. Only to disarm.

727
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:39,630
We don't want any accidents here.
One.

728
01:04:41,359 --> 01:04:43,793
-Two.
-Everte Sta tum!

729
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:57,110
Rictusempra!

730
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:09,358
I said disarm only.

731
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,431
Serpensortia!

732
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:22,433
Don't move. Potter.
I'll get rid of it for you.

733
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:27,799
Allow me. Professor Snape.
Alarte Ascendare!

734
01:06:08,599 --> 01:06:11,159
Vipera Evanesca.

735
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:19,875
What are you playing at?

736
01:06:32,119 --> 01:06:34,713
You're a Parselmouth?
Why didn't you tell us?

737
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:37,029
-|'m a what?
-You can talk to snakes.

738
01:06:37,199 --> 01:06:42,319
I know. I accidentally set a python
on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once.

739
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:46,268
Once. But so what?
I bet loads of people here can do it.

740
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:50,035
No. they can't.
It's not a very common gift. Harry.

741
01:06:50,519 --> 01:06:52,157
This is bad.

742
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:55,915
What's bad? If I hadn't told
that snake not to attack Justin--

743
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:59,390
-That's what you said to it.
-You were there. You heard me.

744
01:06:59,559 --> 01:07:03,268
I heard you speaking Parseltongue.
Snake language.

745
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:06,193
I spoke a different language?

746
01:07:07,239 --> 01:07:09,514
But I didn't realize--

747
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:12,353
How can I speak a language
without knowing I can?

748
01:07:12,519 --> 01:07:16,353
I don't know. but it sounded like you
were egging the snake on or something.

749
01:07:16,519 --> 01:07:18,157
Harry. listen to me.

750
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:21,313
There's a reason the symbol
of Slytherin house is a serpent.

751
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:25,792
Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth.
He could talk to snakes too.

752
01:07:26,039 --> 01:07:27,028
Exactly.

753
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:30,431
Now the whole school's gonna think
you're his great-great-great grandson.

754
01:07:30,599 --> 01:07:32,510
But I'm not.

755
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:36,996
lcan't be.

756
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:40,036
He lived a thousand years ago.

757
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:43,272
For all we know. you could be.

758
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,435
I'll see you back in the common room.

759
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:34,278
I want blood.

760
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:41,830
They all must die.

761
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:44,310
Kill.

762
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:46,951
Kill.

763
01:08:47,719 --> 01:08:49,914
Kill.

764
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:54,119
Time to kill.

765
01:09:26,919 --> 01:09:28,750
Caught in the act.

766
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:30,797
I'll have you out this time. Potter.

767
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:33,668
Mark my words.

768
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:37,913
No. Mr. Filch! You don't understand--

769
01:10:03,559 --> 01:10:05,436
Professor...

770
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:06,919
...I swear I didn't.

771
01:10:07,119 --> 01:10:10,191
This is out of my hands. Potter.

772
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:22,000
Professor Dumbledore
will be waiting for you.

773
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:33,028
Sherbet Lemon.

774
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,636
Professor Dumbledore?

775
01:11:23,439 --> 01:11:26,033
Bee in your bonnet. Potter?

776
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:33,157
l was just wondering
if you put me in the right house.

777
01:11:33,319 --> 01:11:38,552
Yes. You were particularly
difficult to place.

778
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:42,110
But I stand by what I said last year.

779
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:45,511
You would have done well in Slytherin.

780
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:46,953
You're wrong.

781
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:16,392
Harry?

782
01:12:16,759 --> 01:12:18,909
Professor.

783
01:12:19,079 --> 01:12:22,708
Your bird....
There was nothing I could do.

784
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:26,477
-He just caught fire.
-And about time too.

785
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:29,510
He's been looking dreadful for days.

786
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:31,591
Pity you had to see him
on a burning day.

787
01:12:33,439 --> 01:12:36,556
Fawkes is a phoenix. Harry.

788
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:39,917
They burst into flame
when it is time for them to die...

789
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:42,116
...and then they are...

790
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:45,192
...reborn from the ashes.

791
01:12:53,239 --> 01:12:55,753
Fascinating creatures. phoenixes.

792
01:12:56,199 --> 01:12:59,908
They can carry immensely heavy loads.

793
01:13:00,079 --> 01:13:02,798
Their tears have healing powers.

794
01:13:05,319 --> 01:13:08,231
Professor Dumbledore. sir!
Wait! Listen!

795
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:11,236
Professor Dumbledore. sir.
it wasn't Harry.

796
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:15,113
I'd be prepared to swear it
in front of the Ministry of Magic.

797
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:18,317
Relax.

798
01:13:19,039 --> 01:13:20,916
I do not believe...

799
01:13:21,079 --> 01:13:24,435
-...that Harry attacked anyone.
-Of course you don't.

800
01:13:28,039 --> 01:13:30,507
Right. Well. |'||....

801
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:33,672
-|'|| just wait outside. then.
-Yes.

802
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:40,714
-You don't think it was me. professor?
-No. Harry.

803
01:13:40,879 --> 01:13:43,268
I do not think it was you.

804
01:13:44,279 --> 01:13:45,997
But I must ask you...

805
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:50,473
...is there something
you wish to tell me?

806
01:13:56,679 --> 01:13:58,510
No. sir.

807
01:13:58,679 --> 01:14:00,112
Nothing.

808
01:14:02,999 --> 01:14:05,069
Very well. then.

809
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:06,958
Off you go.

810
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:46,749
Everything's set. We just need a bit
of who you're changing into.

811
01:14:46,919 --> 01:14:48,557
Crabbe and Goyle.

812
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:51,392
We also need to make sure
that the real Crabbe and Goyle...

813
01:14:51,559 --> 01:14:54,631
...can't burst in on us
while we're interrogating Malfoy.

814
01:14:54,959 --> 01:14:57,553
-How?
-|'ve got it all worked out.

815
01:14:57,719 --> 01:15:00,187
I filled these
with a simple Sleeping Draught.

816
01:15:00,359 --> 01:15:02,998
Simple. but powerful.

817
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:05,269
Now. once they're asleep...

818
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:08,512
...hide them in the broomstick cupboard
and pull out a few of their hairs...

819
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:10,477
...and put on their uniforms.

820
01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:13,790
-Whose hair are you ripping out. then?
-|'ve already got mine.

821
01:15:13,959 --> 01:15:16,996
Millicent Bulstrode. Slytherin.

822
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:19,230
I got this off her robes.

823
01:15:19,399 --> 01:15:21,913
I'm going to go check
on the Polyjuice Potion.

824
01:15:22,079 --> 01:15:24,673
Make sure that Crabbe and Goyle
find these.

825
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:38,595
Ron. maybe I should do it.

826
01:15:38,759 --> 01:15:40,715
Yeah. Right.

827
01:15:42,840 --> 01:15:44,592
Wingardium l.eviosa.

828
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:55,878
Cool.

829
01:16:18,079 --> 01:16:19,831
How thick could you get?

830
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,877
Come on. let's get them.

831
01:16:24,439 --> 01:16:28,273
We'll have exactly one hour
before we change back into ourselves.

832
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:37,997
Add the hairs.

833
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:44,032
Essence of Crabbe.

834
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:45,997
Cheers.

835
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:56,669
I think I'm gonna be sick.

836
01:16:59,479 --> 01:17:01,231
Me too.

837
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:45,952
Harry?

838
01:17:46,399 --> 01:17:47,878
Ron.

839
01:17:48,599 --> 01:17:50,669
Bloody hell!

840
01:17:51,439 --> 01:17:53,634
We still sound like ourselves.

841
01:17:53,800 --> 01:17:55,472
You need to sound more like Crabbe.

842
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,795
-Bloody hell.
-Exce|lent.

843
01:17:59,119 --> 01:18:01,508
-But where's Hermione?
-|....

844
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:04,558
ldon't think I'm going.
You go on without me.

845
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:06,357
Hermione. are you okay?

846
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:09,239
Just go. You're wasting time.

847
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:12,832
Come on.

848
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:19,397
I think the Slytherin common room's
this way.

849
01:18:22,279 --> 01:18:24,634
Excuse me.

850
01:18:26,359 --> 01:18:28,190
What are you doing d--?

851
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:30,351
I mean. what are you doing down here?

852
01:18:32,199 --> 01:18:34,793
I happen to be a school prefect.

853
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:39,238
You. on the other hand. have no business
wandering the corridors at night.

854
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:41,552
What are your names again?

855
01:18:41,719 --> 01:18:45,553
-|'m....
-Crabbe. Goyle. where have you been?

856
01:18:45,719 --> 01:18:48,631
Pigging out in the Great Hall
all this time?

857
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:52,275
Why are you wearing glasses?

858
01:18:53,080 --> 01:18:55,799
-Reading.
-Reading?

859
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:59,115
I didn't know you could read.

860
01:19:01,879 --> 01:19:03,870
And what are you doing down here.
Weasley?

861
01:19:04,040 --> 01:19:05,996
Mind your attitude. Malfoy.

862
01:19:14,439 --> 01:19:16,350
Well. sit down.

863
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:22,714
You'd never know the Weasleys
were pure-bloods. the way they behave.

864
01:19:22,919 --> 01:19:26,594
They're an embarrassment
to the wizarding world. All of them.

865
01:19:27,399 --> 01:19:29,594
What's wrong with you. Crabbe?

866
01:19:31,719 --> 01:19:33,391
Stomachache.

867
01:19:35,319 --> 01:19:39,949
I'm surprised the Daily Prophet
hasn't done a report on all these attacks.

868
01:19:40,119 --> 01:19:42,474
I suppose Dumbledore
is trying to hush it all up.

869
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:45,035
Father always said Dumbledore
was the worst thing...

870
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:48,829
-...that ever happened to this place.
-You're wrong!

871
01:19:56,039 --> 01:19:57,154
What?

872
01:19:57,320 --> 01:20:00,835
You think there's someone here
who's worse than Dumbledore?

873
01:20:00,999 --> 01:20:03,308
Well? Do you?

874
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:05,636
Harry Potter?

875
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:13,273
Good one. Goyle.

876
01:20:13,439 --> 01:20:14,918
You're absolutely right.

877
01:20:15,559 --> 01:20:17,311
Saint Potter.

878
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:20,953
And people actually think
that he's the Heir of Slytherin?

879
01:20:24,559 --> 01:20:27,073
But then you must have some idea
who's behind it all.

880
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:30,755
You know I don't. Goyle.
I told you yesterday.

881
01:20:31,719 --> 01:20:34,108
How many times do l have to tell you?

882
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:36,832
Is this yours?

883
01:20:41,119 --> 01:20:43,394
But my father did say this:

884
01:20:43,759 --> 01:20:46,557
It's been 50 years
since the Chamber was opened.

885
01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:50,917
He wouldn't tell me who opened it.
Only that they were expelled.

886
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:55,671
The last time the Chamber of Secrets
was opened. a Mudblood died.

887
01:20:55,839 --> 01:20:59,957
So it's only a matter of time
before one of them is killed this time.

888
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:02,272
As for me...

889
01:21:02,439 --> 01:21:04,509
...I hope it's Granger.

890
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:06,796
What's the matter with you two?

891
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:09,349
You're acting very odd.

892
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:11,636
It's his stomachache.

893
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:13,791
Calm down.

894
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:19,711
Scar.

895
01:21:23,159 --> 01:21:24,512
Hair.

896
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:32,715
Hey! Where are you going?

897
01:21:35,599 --> 01:21:36,827
That was close.

898
01:21:36,999 --> 01:21:39,308
Hermione. come out.
We've got loads to tell you.

899
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:41,277
Go away.

900
01:21:41,759 --> 01:21:45,468
Wait till you see. It's awful.

901
01:21:47,359 --> 01:21:49,031
Hermione?

902
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:50,758
Are you okay?

903
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:54,437
Do you remember me telling you...

904
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:57,637
...that the Polyjuice Potion
was only for human transformations?

905
01:21:57,799 --> 01:22:01,758
It was cat hair I plucked off
Millicent Bulstrode's robes.

906
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:05,519
Look at my face.

907
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:08,955
Look at your tail.

908
01:22:15,239 --> 01:22:16,638
Have you spoken to Hermione?

909
01:22:16,799 --> 01:22:19,233
She should be out of hospital
in a few days...

910
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:22,119
...when she stops coughing up fur balls.

911
01:22:26,679 --> 01:22:28,351
What's this?

912
01:22:32,759 --> 01:22:33,794
Yuck!

913
01:22:33,959 --> 01:22:36,632
Looks like Moaning Myrtle's
flooded the bathroom.

914
01:22:52,199 --> 01:22:56,158
-Come to throw something else at me?
-Why would I throw something at you?

915
01:22:56,559 --> 01:23:00,472
Don't ask me. Here I am.
minding my own business...

916
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:04,110
...and someone thinks it's funny
to throw a book at me.

917
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:07,073
But it can't hurt if someone
throws something at you.

918
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:09,549
I mean. it'll just go
right through you.

919
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:14,758
Sure! Let's all throw books at Myrtle
because she can't feel it.

920
01:23:14,919 --> 01:23:17,433
Ten points
if you get it through her stomach!

921
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,956
Fifty points if it goes through her head!

922
01:23:21,439 --> 01:23:25,671
-But who threw it at you. anyway?
-I don't know. I didn't see them.

923
01:23:25,999 --> 01:23:30,072
l was just sitting in the U-bend.
thinking about death...

924
01:23:30,279 --> 01:23:33,794
...and it fell through the top
of my head.

925
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:05,109
“Tom Marvolo Riddle.“

926
01:24:33,759 --> 01:24:35,989
My name...

927
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:38,957
...is Harry...

928
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:42,556
...Potter.

929
01:24:55,240 --> 01:25:00,189
Do you know anything...

930
01:25:00,999 --> 01:25:07,393
...about the Chamber of Secrets?

931
01:25:17,119 --> 01:25:18,950
Can you...

932
01:25:20,160 --> 01:25:22,355
...tell me?

933
01:26:22,079 --> 01:26:25,355
Excuse me. Could you tell me
what's going on here?

934
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:30,910
Are you Tom Riddle?

935
01:26:31,079 --> 01:26:32,797
Hello. can you hear me?

936
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:54,192
Riddle!

937
01:26:54,759 --> 01:26:56,238
Come.

938
01:26:56,399 --> 01:26:58,310
Professor Dumbledore.

939
01:27:00,399 --> 01:27:02,469
Dumbledore?

940
01:27:03,719 --> 01:27:07,075
It is not wise to be wandering around
this late hour. Tom.

941
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:10,437
Yes. professor. I suppose l....

942
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:12,670
I had to see for myself
if the rumors were true.

943
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:16,038
I'm afraid they are. Tom.
They are true.

944
01:27:16,199 --> 01:27:18,918
About the school as well?
ldon't have a home to go to.

945
01:27:19,079 --> 01:27:21,798
They wouldn't really close Hogwarts.
would they. professor?

946
01:27:21,959 --> 01:27:24,393
I understand. Tom. but I'm afraid...

947
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:27,958
...Headmaster Dippet
may have no choice.

948
01:27:28,119 --> 01:27:32,431
Sir. if it all stopped.
if the person responsible was caught....

949
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:36,636
Is there something...

950
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:39,431
...you wish to tell me?

951
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:43,034
No. sir. Nothing.

952
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:52,432
Very well. then. Off you go.

953
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:54,397
Good night. sir.

954
01:28:29,039 --> 01:28:31,837
-Let's get you out of there.
-Evening. Hagrid.

955
01:28:32,159 --> 01:28:36,311
I'm going to have to turn you in. I don't
think you meant it to kill anyone....

956
01:28:36,479 --> 01:28:38,674
You can't. You don't understand.

957
01:28:38,879 --> 01:28:41,871
The dead girl's parents will be here
tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do...

958
01:28:42,040 --> 01:28:44,838
...is make sure the thing that killed
their daughter is slaughtered.

959
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:48,072
It wasn't him.
Aragog never killed no one. Never.

960
01:28:48,399 --> 01:28:50,469
Monsters don't make good pets. Hagrid.

961
01:28:50,640 --> 01:28:52,198
-Now. stand aside.
-No!

962
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:54,237
-Stand aside. Hagrid.
-No!

963
01:28:54,399 --> 01:28:55,957
Cis tem Aperio!

964
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:04,870
Arania Exumai!

965
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:07,119
Aragog!

966
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:08,474
Aragog!

967
01:29:08,999 --> 01:29:10,318
lcan't let you go.

968
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:13,991
They'll have your wand for this. Hagrid.
You'll be expelled.

969
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:18,237
Hagrid!

970
01:29:47,039 --> 01:29:50,998
It was Hagrid. Hagrid opened
the Chamber of Secrets 50 years ago.

971
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:53,993
It can't be Hagrid.
It just can't be.

972
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:58,073
We don't even know this Tom Riddle.
He sounds like a dirty. rotten snitch.

973
01:29:58,240 --> 01:30:01,596
The monster had killed somebody. Ron.
What would any of us have done?

974
01:30:01,879 --> 01:30:05,667
Look. Hagrid's our friend. Why don't
we just go and ask him about it?

975
01:30:05,879 --> 01:30:08,439
That would be a cheerful visit.
“Hello. Hagrid.

976
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:12,275
Tell us. have you been setting anything
mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?“

977
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:15,512
Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talking
about me. now. would you?

978
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:16,789
No.

979
01:30:21,119 --> 01:30:22,677
What's that you've got. Hagrid?

980
01:30:23,119 --> 01:30:27,476
lt's Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent.
For the Mandrakes. you know.

981
01:30:27,639 --> 01:30:31,154
Now. according to Professor Sprout.
they've still got a bit of growing to do.

982
01:30:31,319 --> 01:30:34,675
But once their acne's cleared up.
we'll chop them up and stew them...

983
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:37,991
...and then we'll get those people
down at the hospital un-Petrified.

984
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:42,153
In the meantime. though. you three...

985
01:30:42,319 --> 01:30:45,356
...had best be looking after yourselves.
All right?

986
01:30:52,919 --> 01:30:54,750
Hello. Neville.

987
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:58,189
Harry. I don't know who did it.
but you'd better come.

988
01:30:58,559 --> 01:31:00,197
Come on!

989
01:31:21,839 --> 01:31:25,673
It had to be a Gryffindor.
Nobody else knows our password.

990
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:27,990
Unless it wasn't a student.

991
01:31:28,159 --> 01:31:31,435
Whoever it was. they must have
been looking for something.

992
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:32,953
And they found it.

993
01:31:33,679 --> 01:31:36,068
Tom Riddle's diary is gone.

994
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:38,828
All right. listen up.

995
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,798
We play our game.
Hufflepuff doesn't stand a chance.

996
01:31:41,959 --> 01:31:43,756
We're stronger. quicker and smarter.

997
01:31:43,919 --> 01:31:46,797
Not to mention they're dead scared
that Harry will Petrify them...

998
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:50,316
-...if they fly anywhere near him.
-Well. that too.

999
01:31:51,479 --> 01:31:52,958
Professor McGonagall.

1000
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:56,032
-This match has been canceled.
-We can't cancel Ouidditch.

1001
01:31:56,200 --> 01:32:00,955
Silence. Wood. You and your teammates
will go to Gryffindor Tower. Now.

1002
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:03,680
Potter. you and I will find Mr. Weasley.

1003
01:32:04,039 --> 01:32:06,473
There's something
the both of you have to see.

1004
01:32:08,479 --> 01:32:11,915
I warn you.
This could be a wee bit of a shock.

1005
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:21,109
Hermione!

1006
01:32:21,279 --> 01:32:22,997
She was found near the library...

1007
01:32:24,199 --> 01:32:26,155
...along with this.

1008
01:32:27,559 --> 01:32:30,278
Does it mean anything to either of you?

1009
01:32:30,439 --> 01:32:31,838
No.

1010
01:32:45,479 --> 01:32:47,709
Could I have your attention. please?

1011
01:32:47,879 --> 01:32:53,272
Because of recent events. these new
rules will be put into effect immediately:

1012
01:32:53,599 --> 01:32:58,514
“All students will return to their house
common rooms by 6:00 every evening.

1013
01:32:58,679 --> 01:33:02,592
All students will be escorted
to each lesson by a teacher.

1014
01:33:02,759 --> 01:33:05,637
No exceptions. “

1015
01:33:06,279 --> 01:33:08,235
I should tell you this:

1016
01:33:08,399 --> 01:33:12,358
Unless the culprit
behind these attacks is caught...

1017
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:15,917
...it is likely the school will be closed.

1018
01:33:26,959 --> 01:33:29,792
We've got to talk to Hagrid. Ron.
lcan't believe it's him...

1019
01:33:29,959 --> 01:33:32,154
...but if he did set the monster loose
last time...

1020
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:35,357
...he'll know how to get inside
the Chamber of Secrets. That's a start.

1021
01:33:35,519 --> 01:33:36,713
But you heard McGonagall.

1022
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:40,031
We're not allowed to leave
the tower except for class.

1023
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,835
I think it's time to get
my dad's old cloak out again.

1024
01:33:55,919 --> 01:33:57,557
Who's there?

1025
01:34:01,199 --> 01:34:02,712
Hello?

1026
01:34:03,320 --> 01:34:04,799
Hello?

1027
01:34:05,919 --> 01:34:10,037
-What's that for?
-Nothing. I was expecting....

1028
01:34:10,199 --> 01:34:13,908
It doesn't matter. Come on in.
| just made a pot of tea.

1029
01:34:16,559 --> 01:34:18,754
Hagrid. are you okay?

1030
01:34:18,919 --> 01:34:21,672
I'm fine. I'm all right.

1031
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:24,238
Did you hear about Hermione?

1032
01:34:24,719 --> 01:34:28,234
Yeah. I heard about that. all right.

1033
01:34:28,559 --> 01:34:32,074
Look. we have to ask you something.

1034
01:34:33,679 --> 01:34:37,035
Do you know who's opened
the Chamber of Secrets?

1035
01:34:39,279 --> 01:34:41,474
What you had to understand
about that is--

1036
01:34:43,079 --> 01:34:44,592
Ouick. under the cloak.

1037
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:48,198
Don't say a word.
Be quiet. both of you.

1038
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:57,318
-Professor Dumbledore. sir.
-Good evening. Hagrid.

1039
01:34:57,479 --> 01:34:59,788
I wonder. could we...?

1040
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:02,349
Of course. Come in. Come in.

1041
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:03,839
That's Dad's boss.

1042
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:07,436
Cornelius Fudge. Minister of Magic.

1043
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:11,798
Bad business. Hagrid. very bad business.
Had to come.

1044
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:15,077
Three attacks on Muggle-borns.
Things have gone far enough.

1045
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:18,312
-The Ministry's got to act.
-But I never--

1046
01:35:18,519 --> 01:35:20,237
You know I never. professor.

1047
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:23,358
I want it understood. Cornelius...

1048
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:25,272
...that Hagrid...

1049
01:35:25,439 --> 01:35:27,634
...has my full confidence.

1050
01:35:27,799 --> 01:35:31,428
Albus. look.
Hagrid's record is against him.

1051
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:34,034
-|'ve got to take him.
-Take me?

1052
01:35:34,199 --> 01:35:36,394
Take me where?
Not Azkaban prison.

1053
01:35:36,679 --> 01:35:40,274
I'm afraid we have no choice. Hagrid.

1054
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:42,711
Already here. Fudge?

1055
01:35:42,879 --> 01:35:44,153
Good.

1056
01:35:45,039 --> 01:35:47,678
What are you doing here?
Get out of my house!

1057
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:49,799
Believe me...

1058
01:35:50,079 --> 01:35:54,118
...I take absolutely no pleasure
being inside your....

1059
01:35:55,919 --> 01:35:58,035
You call this a house?

1060
01:35:59,079 --> 01:36:00,068
No.

1061
01:36:00,240 --> 01:36:03,949
I simply called up the school
and was told the headmaster was here.

1062
01:36:04,119 --> 01:36:08,032
Well. what exactly is it
that you want with me?

1063
01:36:08,559 --> 01:36:13,110
The other governors and l have decided
it's time for you to step aside.

1064
01:36:14,679 --> 01:36:17,477
This is an order of suspension.

1065
01:36:22,799 --> 01:36:26,030
You'll find all 12 signatures on it.

1066
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:33,799
I'm afraid we feel
you've rather lost your touch.

1067
01:36:34,479 --> 01:36:36,709
Well. what. with all these attacks...

1068
01:36:36,879 --> 01:36:39,552
...there'll be no
Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts.

1069
01:36:39,719 --> 01:36:44,076
I can only imagine what an awful loss
that would be to the school.

1070
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:46,356
You can't take
Professor Dumbledore away.

1071
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:49,074
Take him away and the Muggle-borns
won't stand a chance.

1072
01:36:49,239 --> 01:36:51,594
You mark my words.
there'll be killings next!

1073
01:36:51,759 --> 01:36:53,351
You think so?

1074
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:55,909
Calm yourself. Hagrid.

1075
01:36:57,200 --> 01:36:59,839
If the governors desire my removal...

1076
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,549
...I will. of course. step aside.

1077
01:37:05,079 --> 01:37:07,229
However...

1078
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:12,237
...you will find that help
will always be given at Hogwarts...

1079
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:14,197
...to those who...

1080
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:16,590
...ask for it.

1081
01:37:23,120 --> 01:37:25,350
Admirable sentiments.

1082
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:27,272
Shall we?

1083
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:40,359
Fudge.

1084
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,752
Come. Hagrid.

1085
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:46,319
Well?

1086
01:37:46,959 --> 01:37:47,994
|f....

1087
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:50,834
If anybody was looking for some stuff...

1088
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:55,676
...then all they'd have to do
would be to follow the spiders.

1089
01:37:55,839 --> 01:37:58,307
Yep. That would lead them right.

1090
01:37:58,479 --> 01:38:00,356
That's all l have to say.

1091
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:05,595
And someone will need
to feed Fang while I'm away.

1092
01:38:08,840 --> 01:38:10,751
Good boy.

1093
01:38:16,640 --> 01:38:18,676
Hagrid's right.

1094
01:38:18,839 --> 01:38:21,672
With Dumbledore gone.
there'll be an attack a day.

1095
01:38:21,839 --> 01:38:23,431
Look.

1096
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:30,958
Come on.

1097
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:36,476
Come on. Fang.

1098
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,319
Come on.

1099
01:38:55,479 --> 01:38:56,707
What?

1100
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:59,997
You heard what Hagrid said.
“Follow the spiders.“

1101
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:02,714
They're heading to the Dark Forest.

1102
01:39:04,679 --> 01:39:08,957
Why spiders? Why couldn't it be
“follow the butterflies“?

1103
01:39:43,240 --> 01:39:45,879
Harry. I don't like this.

1104
01:39:50,799 --> 01:39:53,871
-Harry. I don't like this at all.
-Shush!

1105
01:40:04,919 --> 01:40:07,353
Can we go back now?

1106
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:09,192
Come on.

1107
01:40:56,880 --> 01:40:59,519
Who is it?

1108
01:41:00,159 --> 01:41:01,228
Don't panic.

1109
01:41:01,559 --> 01:41:02,992
Hagrid?

1110
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:04,913
Is that you?

1111
01:41:05,480 --> 01:41:07,311
We're friends of Hagrid's.

1112
01:41:24,679 --> 01:41:27,751
And you?
You're Aragog. aren't you?

1113
01:41:28,359 --> 01:41:29,587
Yes.

1114
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:33,389
Hagrid has never sent
men into our hollow before.

1115
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:36,552
He's in trouble. Up at the school.
there have been attacks.

1116
01:41:37,159 --> 01:41:38,911
They think it's Hagrid.

1117
01:41:39,080 --> 01:41:42,550
They think he opened
the Chamber of Secrets. Like before.

1118
01:41:42,759 --> 01:41:44,989
That's a lie.

1119
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:48,238
Hagrid never opened
the Chamber of Secrets.

1120
01:41:48,839 --> 01:41:51,592
-Then you're not the monster?
-No.

1121
01:41:51,759 --> 01:41:54,671
The monster was born in the castle.

1122
01:41:54,879 --> 01:41:59,953
I came to Hagrid from a distant land
in the pocket of a traveler.

1123
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:02,118
Harry.

1124
01:42:03,959 --> 01:42:08,350
But if you're not the monster. then
what did kill that girl 50 years ago?

1125
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:11,398
We do not speak of it.

1126
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:17,033
It is an ancient creature we
spiders fear above all others.

1127
01:42:17,199 --> 01:42:18,917
But have you seen it?

1128
01:42:19,559 --> 01:42:25,156
I never saw any part of the castle
but the box in which Hagrid kept me.

1129
01:42:25,319 --> 01:42:28,356
The girl was discovered
in a bathroom.

1130
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:32,832
When I was accused.
Hagrid brought me here.

1131
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,911
-Harry!
-What?

1132
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:50,118
Well. thank you.

1133
01:42:51,039 --> 01:42:53,109
We'll just go.

1134
01:42:53,559 --> 01:42:55,231
Go?

1135
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:57,158
I think not.

1136
01:42:57,319 --> 01:43:02,552
My sons and daughters
do not harm Hagrid on my command.

1137
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:05,028
But I cannot deny them
fresh meat...

1138
01:43:05,199 --> 01:43:09,351
...when it wanders
so willingly into our midst.

1139
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:13,149
Goodbye. friend of Hagrid.

1140
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:15,072
Can we panic now?

1141
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:27,191
Know any spells?

1142
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:30,397
One. but it's not powerful
enough for all of them.

1143
01:43:30,559 --> 01:43:33,198
Where's Hermione when you need her?

1144
01:43:46,159 --> 01:43:47,387
Let's go!

1145
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:54,311
Arania Exumai!

1146
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:00,674
Go!

1147
01:44:17,919 --> 01:44:19,910
Glad we're out of there.

1148
01:44:26,599 --> 01:44:28,829
Arania Exumai!

1149
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:37,915
-Thanks for that.
-Don't mention it.

1150
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:50,470
Get us out of here.

1151
01:44:50,959 --> 01:44:52,551
Now!

1152
01:44:54,559 --> 01:44:58,632
Come on!
Come on. move faster!

1153
01:45:01,200 --> 01:45:02,474
Come on! Go!

1154
01:45:19,279 --> 01:45:21,235
Get us in the air.

1155
01:45:22,279 --> 01:45:23,678
The flying gear's jammed!

1156
01:45:27,600 --> 01:45:31,229
-Come on! Pull!
-|'m trying!

1157
01:45:59,359 --> 01:46:02,157
Follow the spiders.
Follow the spiders.

1158
01:46:02,319 --> 01:46:06,471
lf Hagrid ever gets out of Azkaban.
I'll kill him.

1159
01:46:19,919 --> 01:46:22,991
I mean. what was the point
of sending us in there?

1160
01:46:23,159 --> 01:46:27,596
-What have we found out?
-We know one thing.

1161
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:30,991
Hagrid never opened
the Chamber of Secrets.

1162
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:33,111
He was innocent.

1163
01:46:47,960 --> 01:46:50,315
Wish you were here. Hermione.

1164
01:46:50,839 --> 01:46:53,034
We need you.

1165
01:46:53,919 --> 01:46:55,910
Now more than ever.

1166
01:47:12,159 --> 01:47:15,435
-What's that?
-Ron. . ..

1167
01:47:16,240 --> 01:47:20,518
This is why Hermione was in
the library the day she was attacked.

1168
01:47:21,039 --> 01:47:22,233
Come on.

1169
01:47:22,879 --> 01:47:25,712
“Of the many fearsome beasts
that roam our land...

1170
01:47:25,879 --> 01:47:30,316
...none is more deadly than the basilisk.
Capable of living for hundreds of years...

1171
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:34,109
...instant death awaits any who meet
this giant serpent's eye.

1172
01:47:34,280 --> 01:47:37,158
Spiders flee before it.“
Ron. this is it.

1173
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:39,993
The monster in the Chamber
of Secrets is a basilisk.

1174
01:47:40,159 --> 01:47:43,913
That's why I can hear it speak.
It's a snake.

1175
01:47:44,239 --> 01:47:49,313
But if it kills by looking people
in the eye. why is it no one's dead?

1176
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:02,318
Because no one did look it
in the eye.

1177
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:06,668
Not directly. at least.

1178
01:48:07,879 --> 01:48:09,995
Colin saw it through his camera.

1179
01:48:10,159 --> 01:48:14,038
Justin-- Justin must have seen the
basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick.

1180
01:48:14,199 --> 01:48:18,033
Nick got the full blast of it.
But he's a ghost. he couldn't die again.

1181
01:48:18,199 --> 01:48:21,191
And Hermione had the mirror.

1182
01:48:21,359 --> 01:48:24,590
I bet you she was using it to look
around corners in case it came along.

1183
01:48:24,759 --> 01:48:25,987
And Mrs. Norris?

1184
01:48:26,159 --> 01:48:29,515
I'm pretty sure she didn't have
a camera or a mirror. Harry.

1185
01:48:30,999 --> 01:48:32,796
The water.

1186
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:38,598
There was water on the floor that night.
She only saw the basilisk's reflection.

1187
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:46,311
“Spiders flee before it.“

1188
01:48:46,480 --> 01:48:50,075
-It all fits.
-How's a basilisk been getting around?

1189
01:48:50,239 --> 01:48:52,958
A dirty. great snake.
Someone would have seen it.

1190
01:48:53,119 --> 01:48:58,557
-Hermione's answered that too.
-Pipes? lt's using the plumbing.

1191
01:48:58,720 --> 01:49:02,793
Remember what Aragog said
about that girl 50 years ago?

1192
01:49:02,959 --> 01:49:07,032
She died in a bathroom?
What if she never left?

1193
01:49:07,680 --> 01:49:08,954
Moaning Myrtle.

1194
01:49:09,879 --> 01:49:13,758
All students are to return
to their house dormitories at once.

1195
01:49:13,919 --> 01:49:17,195
All teachers to the second-floor
corridor immediately.

1196
01:49:21,999 --> 01:49:27,596
As you can see. the Heir of Slytherin
has left another message.

1197
01:49:27,759 --> 01:49:29,875
Our worst fear has been realized.

1198
01:49:30,040 --> 01:49:34,431
A student has been taken by the monster
into the Chamber itself.

1199
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:40,878
The students must be sent home.
I'm afraid this is the end of Hogwarts.

1200
01:49:43,159 --> 01:49:45,514
So sorry. Dozed off.
What have I missed?

1201
01:49:45,679 --> 01:49:49,831
A girl has been snatched by the monster.
Lockhart. Your moment has come at last.

1202
01:49:49,999 --> 01:49:52,832
-My moment?
-Weren't you saying just last night...

1203
01:49:52,999 --> 01:49:57,356
...that you've known all along where the
entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is?

1204
01:49:58,639 --> 01:50:03,918
That's settled. We'll leave you
to deal with the monster. Gilderoy.

1205
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:09,029
-Your skills. after all. are legend.
-Very well.

1206
01:50:09,199 --> 01:50:12,271
I'll just be in my office getting....

1207
01:50:13,080 --> 01:50:14,957
Getting ready.

1208
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:20,832
Who is it that the monster's taken.
Minerva?

1209
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:22,752
Ginny Weasley.

1210
01:50:33,679 --> 01:50:36,637
“Her skeleton will lie
in the Chamber forever.“

1211
01:50:40,520 --> 01:50:42,238
Ginny.

1212
01:50:44,240 --> 01:50:47,596
Lockhart may be useless. but he's
going to try and get into the Chamber.

1213
01:50:47,759 --> 01:50:50,353
At least we can tell him
what we know.

1214
01:50:51,639 --> 01:50:54,107
Professor. we have some information
for you.

1215
01:50:55,800 --> 01:50:57,677
Are you going somewhere?

1216
01:50:57,839 --> 01:51:00,831
Well. yes. Urgent call. Unavoidable.
Got to go.

1217
01:51:00,999 --> 01:51:04,071
-What about my sister?
-We||....

1218
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:07,756
As to that. most unfortunate.
No one regrets more than I.

1219
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:11,754
You're the Defense Against the Dark
Arts teacher. You can't go now.

1220
01:51:11,919 --> 01:51:14,797
I must say. when I took the job.
there was nothing in the description--

1221
01:51:14,959 --> 01:51:16,074
You' re running away?

1222
01:51:16,239 --> 01:51:18,912
-After all you did in your books?
-Books can be misleading.

1223
01:51:19,080 --> 01:51:21,514
-You wrote them.
-My dear boy. use your common sense.

1224
01:51:21,680 --> 01:51:25,912
My books wouldn't have sold as well if
people didn't think I'd done those things.

1225
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:27,993
You're a fraud.

1226
01:51:28,159 --> 01:51:30,832
You've been taking credit
for what other wizards have done.

1227
01:51:30,999 --> 01:51:32,876
Is there anything you can do?

1228
01:51:33,039 --> 01:51:37,555
Yes. now you mention it.
I'm rather gifted with Memory Charms.

1229
01:51:37,720 --> 01:51:40,109
Otherwise. all those wizards
would have gone blabbing.

1230
01:51:40,280 --> 01:51:43,272
I'd never have sold another book.

1231
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:48,912
In fact. I'm going to have to do
the same to you.

1232
01:51:49,400 --> 01:51:52,073
Don't even think about it.

1233
01:52:02,480 --> 01:52:03,879
Who's there?

1234
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:08,156
Hello. Harry.

1235
01:52:09,039 --> 01:52:13,988
-What do you want?
-To ask you how you died.

1236
01:52:16,280 --> 01:52:18,635
It was dreadful.

1237
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:22,315
It happened right here
in this very cubicle.

1238
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:26,359
l'd hidden because Olive Hornby
was teasing me about my glasses.

1239
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:31,230
l was crying. and then
I heard somebody come in.

1240
01:52:31,400 --> 01:52:37,475
-Who was it. Myrtle?
-I don't know. I was distraught!

1241
01:52:38,719 --> 01:52:41,995
But they said something funny.
a kind of made-up language.

1242
01:52:42,159 --> 01:52:48,234
And I realized it was a boy. so I unlocked
the door to tell him to go away and...

1243
01:52:49,360 --> 01:52:53,990
-...I died.
-Just like that? How?

1244
01:52:54,159 --> 01:52:58,471
| just remember seeing a pair
of great. big. yellow eyes...

1245
01:52:58,640 --> 01:53:02,315
...over there by that sink.

1246
01:53:26,399 --> 01:53:28,355
This is it.

1247
01:53:29,199 --> 01:53:33,829
This is it. Ron. I think this is
the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets.

1248
01:53:35,759 --> 01:53:40,389
Say something. Harry.
say something in Parseltongue.

1249
01:54:29,839 --> 01:54:33,752
Excellent. Harry. Good work.
Well. then. I'll just be....

1250
01:54:33,919 --> 01:54:36,069
There's no need for me to stay.

1251
01:54:36,680 --> 01:54:38,477
Yes. there is.

1252
01:54:40,239 --> 01:54:43,197
-You first.
-Now. boys. what good will it do?

1253
01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:44,634
Better you than us.

1254
01:54:45,800 --> 01:54:48,598
But-- Obviously. yes.

1255
01:54:52,720 --> 01:54:55,314
Sure you don't want to test it first?

1256
01:55:01,839 --> 01:55:04,956
It's really quite filthy down here.

1257
01:55:05,399 --> 01:55:09,756
-All right. Let's go.
-Oh. Harry?

1258
01:55:10,159 --> 01:55:14,869
If you die down there.
you're welcome to share my toilet.

1259
01:55:17,320 --> 01:55:19,197
Thanks. Myrtle.

1260
01:55:47,119 --> 01:55:52,068
Now, remember: Any sign of movement.
close your eyes straightaway.

1261
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:54,592
Go on.

1262
01:55:58,160 --> 01:55:59,434
This way.

1263
01:56:06,159 --> 01:56:11,187
-What's this?
-It looks like a snake.

1264
01:56:11,360 --> 01:56:14,875
-|t's a snakeskin.
-Bloody hell.

1265
01:56:15,040 --> 01:56:20,592
Whatever shed this must be
60 feet long. Or more.

1266
01:56:22,439 --> 01:56:25,272
Heart of a lion. this one.

1267
01:56:28,840 --> 01:56:33,311
The adventure ends here. boys.
But don't fret.

1268
01:56:35,160 --> 01:56:40,393
The world will know our story.
How I was too late to save the girl.

1269
01:56:40,719 --> 01:56:44,075
How you two
tragically lost your minds...

1270
01:56:44,240 --> 01:56:47,118
...at the sight of her mangled body.

1271
01:56:47,919 --> 01:56:49,318
So....

1272
01:56:50,399 --> 01:56:52,629
You first. Mr. Potter.

1273
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:55,917
Say goodbye to your memories.

1274
01:56:57,879 --> 01:56:59,756
Oblivia te!

1275
01:57:32,280 --> 01:57:35,272
-Ron! Ron. are you okay?
-|'m fine.

1276
01:57:38,879 --> 01:57:40,551
Hello.

1277
01:57:41,200 --> 01:57:42,952
Who are you?

1278
01:57:44,280 --> 01:57:46,840
-Ron Weasley.
-ReaHy?

1279
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:49,753
And who am |?

1280
01:57:51,439 --> 01:57:55,591
Lockhart's Memory Charm backfired.
He hasn't got a clue who he is.

1281
01:57:55,920 --> 01:58:00,232
It's an odd sort of place. isn't it?

1282
01:58:00,399 --> 01:58:02,435
Do you live here?

1283
01:58:03,119 --> 01:58:05,508
-No.
-ReaHy?

1284
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:11,638
-What do I do now?
-You wait here...

1285
01:58:11,800 --> 01:58:14,633
...and try and shift some of this rock
so we can get back through.

1286
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:18,315
-|'|| go on and find Ginny.
-Okay.

1287
01:59:47,719 --> 01:59:51,428
Ginny! Ginny. please don't be dead.
Wake up. wake up.

1288
01:59:51,919 --> 01:59:53,910
Please wake up.

1289
01:59:54,159 --> 01:59:56,229
She won't wake.

1290
02:00:01,479 --> 02:00:05,631
Tom. Tom Riddle.
What do you mean. she won't wake?

1291
02:00:05,800 --> 02:00:09,031
-She's not...?
-She's still alive. but only just.

1292
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,195
-Are you a ghost?
-A memory...

1293
02:00:12,359 --> 02:00:14,634
...preserved in a diary for 50 years.

1294
02:00:17,200 --> 02:00:22,194
She's cold as ice.
Ginny. please don't be dead. Wake up.

1295
02:00:22,359 --> 02:00:24,668
You've got to help me. Tom.
There's a basilisk.

1296
02:00:24,839 --> 02:00:27,307
It won't come until it's called.

1297
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,719
-Give me my wand. Tom.
-You won't be needing it.

1298
02:00:33,720 --> 02:00:36,996
-We've got to go. We've got to save her.
-|'m afraid I can't do that.

1299
02:00:37,159 --> 02:00:41,038
You see. as poor Ginny grows weaker.
I grow stronger.

1300
02:00:42,319 --> 02:00:46,631
Yes. Harry. it was Ginny Weasley
who opened the Chamber of Secrets.

1301
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:49,030
No. She couldn't. She wouldn't.

1302
02:00:49,200 --> 02:00:52,272
It was Ginny who set the basilisk
on the Mudbloods and Filch's cat...

1303
02:00:52,439 --> 02:00:54,794
...Ginny who wrote the threatening
messages on the walls.

1304
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:58,111
-But why?
-Because I told her to.

1305
02:00:58,279 --> 02:01:03,034
You'll find I can be very persuasive.
Not that she knew what she was doing.

1306
02:01:03,199 --> 02:01:06,396
She was. shall we say.
in a kind of trance.

1307
02:01:06,919 --> 02:01:09,308
Still. the power of the diary
began to scare her.

1308
02:01:09,479 --> 02:01:11,754
She tried to dispose of it
in the girls' bathroom.

1309
02:01:11,919 --> 02:01:16,071
And then who should find it but you?

1310
02:01:16,240 --> 02:01:19,232
The very person
I was most anxious to meet.

1311
02:01:19,800 --> 02:01:21,791
And why did you want to meet me?

1312
02:01:22,159 --> 02:01:25,390
I knew I had to talk to you.
meet you if I could.

1313
02:01:25,560 --> 02:01:28,711
So I decided to show you my capture
of that brainless oaf Hagrid...

1314
02:01:28,880 --> 02:01:31,917
-...to gain your trust.
-Hagrid's my friend.

1315
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:37,191
-And you framed him. didn't you?
-It was my word against Hagrid's.

1316
02:01:37,359 --> 02:01:40,510
Only Dumbledore seemed to think
he was innocent.

1317
02:01:40,679 --> 02:01:42,749
I'll bet Dumbledore saw
right through you.

1318
02:01:42,919 --> 02:01:46,229
He certainly kept an annoyingly close
watch on me after that.

1319
02:01:46,399 --> 02:01:49,550
I knew it wouldn't be safe to open the
Chamber again while I was at school...

1320
02:01:49,719 --> 02:01:51,471
...so I decided to leave behind
a diary...

1321
02:01:51,639 --> 02:01:53,675
...preserving my 16-year-old self
in its pages...

1322
02:01:53,839 --> 02:01:56,399
...so that one day
I would be able to lead another...

1323
02:01:56,560 --> 02:01:59,279
...to finish Salazar Slytherin's
noble work.

1324
02:01:59,439 --> 02:02:01,589
Well. you haven't finished it
this time.

1325
02:02:01,759 --> 02:02:04,592
In a few hours. the Mandrake Draught
will be ready.

1326
02:02:04,759 --> 02:02:07,398
And everyone who was Petrified
will be all right again.

1327
02:02:07,759 --> 02:02:12,787
Haven't I told you? Killing Mudbloods
doesn't matter to me anymore.

1328
02:02:13,040 --> 02:02:17,636
For many months now.
my new target has been you.

1329
02:02:19,040 --> 02:02:22,476
How is it that a baby
with no extraordinary magical talent...

1330
02:02:22,639 --> 02:02:25,199
...was able to defeat the greatest wizard
of all time?

1331
02:02:25,519 --> 02:02:28,352
How did you escape with nothing
but a scar...

1332
02:02:28,519 --> 02:02:30,794
...while Lord Voldemort's powers
were destroyed?

1333
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:34,953
Why do you care how I escaped?
Voldemort was after your time.

1334
02:02:35,119 --> 02:02:41,354
Voldemort is my past.
present and future.

1335
02:03:00,919 --> 02:03:04,229
You. You're the Heir of Slytherin.

1336
02:03:07,279 --> 02:03:10,715
-You're Voldemort.
-Surely you didn't think...

1337
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:15,192
...l was going to keep
my filthy Muggle father's name?

1338
02:03:15,360 --> 02:03:19,353
No. l fashioned myself a new name.
a name I knew wizards everywhere...

1339
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:23,559
...would fear to speak when I became
the greatest sorcerer in the world.

1340
02:03:23,719 --> 02:03:26,756
Albus Dumbledore
is the greatest sorcerer in the world.

1341
02:03:26,919 --> 02:03:30,150
Dumbledore's been driven out of
this castle by the mere memory of me.

1342
02:03:30,359 --> 02:03:35,194
He'll never be gone. Not as long as
those who remain are loyal to him.

1343
02:03:41,319 --> 02:03:42,308
Fawkes?

1344
02:03:57,919 --> 02:04:01,355
So this is what Dumbledore
sends his great defender.

1345
02:04:01,520 --> 02:04:05,035
A songbird and an old hat.

1346
02:04:17,799 --> 02:04:22,156
Let's match the power of Lord
Voldemort. Heir of Salazar Slytherin...

1347
02:04:22,319 --> 02:04:26,153
...against the famous Harry Potter.

1348
02:04:38,960 --> 02:04:43,112
Parseltongue won't save you now.
Potter. It only obeys me.

1349
02:05:12,080 --> 02:05:13,559
No!

1350
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:18,312
Your bird may have blinded the basilisk.
but it can still hear you.

1351
02:06:56,119 --> 02:06:59,270
Yes. Potter.
The process is nearly complete.

1352
02:06:59,439 --> 02:07:04,149
In a few minutes. Ginny Weasley will be
dead. and I will cease to be a memory.

1353
02:07:04,319 --> 02:07:06,879
Lord Voldemort will return...

1354
02:07:07,239 --> 02:07:11,278
...very much alive.

1355
02:07:11,959 --> 02:07:13,312
Ginny?

1356
02:09:24,080 --> 02:09:25,593
Remarkable. isn't it...

1357
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:29,594
...how quickly the venom
of the basilisk penetrates the body?

1358
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:32,320
I'd guess you have little more
than a minute to live.

1359
02:09:32,639 --> 02:09:36,518
You'll be with your dear
Mudblood mother soon. Harry.

1360
02:09:41,320 --> 02:09:44,835
Funny. the damage a silly
little book can do...

1361
02:09:44,999 --> 02:09:49,834
...especially in the hands
of a silly little girl.

1362
02:09:52,560 --> 02:09:54,312
What are you doing?

1363
02:09:57,039 --> 02:09:59,075
Stop. No!

1364
02:10:54,960 --> 02:10:58,794
It was me.
But I swear. I didn't mean to.

1365
02:10:58,960 --> 02:11:02,316
Riddle made me. and....

1366
02:11:02,799 --> 02:11:05,359
Harry. you're hurt.

1367
02:11:05,680 --> 02:11:07,113
Don't worry.

1368
02:11:07,280 --> 02:11:10,795
Ginny. you need
to get yourself out.

1369
02:11:10,960 --> 02:11:14,077
Follow the Chamber
and you'll find Ron.

1370
02:11:25,719 --> 02:11:27,755
You were brilliant. Fawkes.

1371
02:11:28,839 --> 02:11:31,148
| just wasn't quick enough.

1372
02:11:51,119 --> 02:11:52,757
Of course.

1373
02:11:53,040 --> 02:11:55,759
Phoenix tears have healing powers.

1374
02:11:57,320 --> 02:11:59,038
Thanks.

1375
02:12:00,719 --> 02:12:02,755
It's all right. Ginny.

1376
02:12:03,840 --> 02:12:05,956
It's over.

1377
02:12:06,920 --> 02:12:09,354
It's just a memory.

1378
02:12:12,119 --> 02:12:17,239
Amazing!
This is just like magic!

1379
02:12:28,079 --> 02:12:30,639
You both realize. of course...

1380
02:12:30,799 --> 02:12:36,078
...that in the past few hours. you have
broken perhaps a dozen school rules.

1381
02:12:36,679 --> 02:12:37,668
Yes. sir.

1382
02:12:37,839 --> 02:12:40,911
There is sufficient evidence
to have you both expelled.

1383
02:12:41,080 --> 02:12:42,229
Yes. sir.

1384
02:12:42,400 --> 02:12:45,039
Therefore. it is only fitting...

1385
02:12:46,519 --> 02:12:48,714
...that you both receive...

1386
02:12:49,200 --> 02:12:53,113
...Special Awards for Services
to the School.

1387
02:12:55,120 --> 02:12:56,872
Thanks. sir.

1388
02:12:57,440 --> 02:12:59,635
Now. Mr. Weasley. if you would...

1389
02:12:59,799 --> 02:13:03,792
...have an owl deliver these
release papers to Azkaban.

1390
02:13:04,880 --> 02:13:09,431
I believe we want
our gamekeeper back.

1391
02:13:14,200 --> 02:13:18,352
First. I want to thank you. Harry.

1392
02:13:18,960 --> 02:13:22,316
You must have shown me
real loyalty down in the Chamber.

1393
02:13:23,160 --> 02:13:27,551
Nothing but that
could have called Fawkes to you.

1394
02:13:29,840 --> 02:13:31,319
And...

1395
02:13:31,879 --> 02:13:33,232
...second...

1396
02:13:33,399 --> 02:13:37,995
...I sense that something
is troubling you.

1397
02:13:38,200 --> 02:13:40,589
Am I right. Harry?

1398
02:13:42,359 --> 02:13:44,031
It's just....

1399
02:13:45,159 --> 02:13:49,675
You see. sir. I couldn't help
but notice certain things. certain....

1400
02:13:49,839 --> 02:13:55,277
Certain similarities
between Tom Riddle and me.

1401
02:13:55,799 --> 02:13:56,948
| see.

1402
02:13:57,120 --> 02:14:02,672
Well. you can speak
Parseltongue. Harry. Why?

1403
02:14:03,120 --> 02:14:08,399
Because Lord Voldemort
can speak Parseltongue.

1404
02:14:09,560 --> 02:14:12,199
If I'm not mistaken. Harry...

1405
02:14:12,559 --> 02:14:16,234
...he transferred
some of his powers to you...

1406
02:14:16,399 --> 02:14:19,232
...the night he gave you that scar.

1407
02:14:19,399 --> 02:14:23,108
Voldemort transferred
some of his powers to me?

1408
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:27,554
Not intentionally...

1409
02:14:28,399 --> 02:14:30,230
...but yes.

1410
02:14:32,079 --> 02:14:35,276
So the Sorting Hat was right.
I should be in Slytherin.

1411
02:14:35,439 --> 02:14:40,069
It's true. You possess many of the
qualities that Voldemort himself prizes.

1412
02:14:40,239 --> 02:14:42,958
Determination. resourcefulness...

1413
02:14:43,120 --> 02:14:46,954
...and if I may say so.
a certain disregard for the rules.

1414
02:14:47,639 --> 02:14:51,473
Why. then. did the Sorting Hat
place you in Gryffindor?

1415
02:14:52,279 --> 02:14:55,794
-Because I asked it to.
-Exactly. Harry. Exactly.

1416
02:14:55,959 --> 02:14:57,950
Which makes you different
from Voldemort.

1417
02:14:58,119 --> 02:15:01,828
It is not our abilities
that show what we truly are.

1418
02:15:02,119 --> 02:15:04,155
It is our choices.

1419
02:15:07,680 --> 02:15:10,956
If you want proof
why you belong in Gryffindor...

1420
02:15:11,120 --> 02:15:15,796
...then I suggest
you look more closely at this.

1421
02:15:16,760 --> 02:15:18,352
Be careful.

1422
02:15:23,800 --> 02:15:26,360
Godric Gryffindor.

1423
02:15:26,520 --> 02:15:30,433
It would take a true Gryffindor
to pull that out of the hat.

1424
02:15:38,960 --> 02:15:40,279
Dobby.

1425
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:45,718
So this is your master.
The family you serve is the Malfoys.

1426
02:15:47,799 --> 02:15:50,996
l'll deal with you later.

1427
02:15:56,599 --> 02:15:58,157
Out of my way. Potter.

1428
02:15:58,320 --> 02:16:01,756
So it's true. You have returned.

1429
02:16:02,399 --> 02:16:05,072
When the governors learned that
Arthur Weasley's daughter...

1430
02:16:05,240 --> 02:16:09,233
...was taken into the Chamber.
they saw fit to summon me back.

1431
02:16:10,040 --> 02:16:13,953
-Ridicu|ous.
-Curious|y. Lucius. several of them...

1432
02:16:14,119 --> 02:16:17,634
...were under the impression
that you would curse their family...

1433
02:16:17,799 --> 02:16:20,518
...if they did not agree
to suspend me in the first place.

1434
02:16:20,960 --> 02:16:24,270
-How dare you!
-Beg your pardon?

1435
02:16:24,440 --> 02:16:28,069
My sole concern has always been
and will always be...

1436
02:16:28,240 --> 02:16:30,959
...the welfare of this school...

1437
02:16:31,119 --> 02:16:35,237
...and. of course. its students.

1438
02:16:39,120 --> 02:16:43,159
The culprit has been identified.
I presume?

1439
02:16:43,520 --> 02:16:44,999
Yes.

1440
02:16:46,519 --> 02:16:48,271
And?

1441
02:16:49,399 --> 02:16:51,355
Who was it?

1442
02:16:57,520 --> 02:16:59,954
Voldemort.

1443
02:17:01,079 --> 02:17:06,312
Only this time he chose to act
through somebody else...

1444
02:17:06,839 --> 02:17:10,309
...by means of this.

1445
02:17:12,879 --> 02:17:14,358
| see.

1446
02:17:15,760 --> 02:17:19,799
Fortunately. our young Mr. Potter
discovered it.

1447
02:17:20,119 --> 02:17:23,634
One hopes that no more of Lord
Voldemort's old school-things...

1448
02:17:23,799 --> 02:17:26,916
...should find their way
into innocent hands.

1449
02:17:27,239 --> 02:17:30,993
The consequences for the one
responsible would be...

1450
02:17:31,360 --> 02:17:33,157
. . .severe.

1451
02:17:34,519 --> 02:17:37,192
Well. let us hope...

1452
02:17:37,360 --> 02:17:42,673
...that Mr. Potter will always
be around to save the day.

1453
02:17:43,399 --> 02:17:46,994
Don't worry. I will be.

1454
02:17:55,399 --> 02:17:57,355
Dumbledore.

1455
02:17:58,439 --> 02:18:01,829
Come. Dobby. We're leaving.

1456
02:18:18,400 --> 02:18:22,678
Sir?
I wonder if I could have that?

1457
02:18:28,839 --> 02:18:30,352
Mr. Malfoy.

1458
02:18:30,520 --> 02:18:32,636
Mr. Malfoy!

1459
02:18:33,079 --> 02:18:35,149
l have something of yours.

1460
02:18:36,759 --> 02:18:39,592
Mine? I don't know
what you're talking about.

1461
02:18:39,760 --> 02:18:41,239
I think you do. sir.

1462
02:18:41,399 --> 02:18:44,391
I think you slipped the diary
into Ginny Weasley's cauldron...

1463
02:18:44,560 --> 02:18:45,913
...that day at Diagon Alley.

1464
02:18:46,599 --> 02:18:49,033
You do. do you?

1465
02:18:56,079 --> 02:18:59,037
Why don't you prove it?

1466
02:19:05,040 --> 02:19:07,110
Come. Dobby.

1467
02:19:08,359 --> 02:19:10,315
Open it.

1468
02:19:13,680 --> 02:19:15,159
Dobby.

1469
02:19:15,319 --> 02:19:18,356
Master has given Dobby a sock.

1470
02:19:18,640 --> 02:19:20,631
What? I didn't give--

1471
02:19:20,800 --> 02:19:24,349
Master has presented Dobby
with clothes.

1472
02:19:24,520 --> 02:19:27,432
Dobby is free.

1473
02:19:33,720 --> 02:19:37,315
You lost me my servant!

1474
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:47,834
You shall not harm Harry Potter.

1475
02:19:59,480 --> 02:20:03,029
Your parents were
meddlesome fools too.

1476
02:20:03,200 --> 02:20:06,237
Mark my words. Potter.
One day soon...

1477
02:20:06,400 --> 02:20:11,394
...you are going to meet
the same sticky end.

1478
02:20:16,880 --> 02:20:22,512
Harry Potter freed Dobby.
How can Dobby ever repay him?

1479
02:20:22,880 --> 02:20:26,953
-Just promise me something.
-Anything. sir.

1480
02:20:28,839 --> 02:20:31,194
Never try to save my life again.

1481
02:20:37,079 --> 02:20:39,957
-We|come back. Sir Nicholas.
-Thank you.

1482
02:20:40,239 --> 02:20:42,514
-Good evening. Sir Nicholas.
-Good evening.

1483
02:20:42,679 --> 02:20:45,477
-Good to see you. Sir Nicholas.
-Thank you.

1484
02:20:46,800 --> 02:20:48,916
Hello.

1485
02:20:50,560 --> 02:20:54,997
-Hermione! Welcome back.
-Thanks. Sir Nicholas.

1486
02:20:58,119 --> 02:21:01,316
Harry. lt's Hermione.

1487
02:21:27,040 --> 02:21:30,589
-We|come back. Hermione.
-|t's good to be back.

1488
02:21:30,759 --> 02:21:33,227
Congratulations.
I can't believe you solved it.

1489
02:21:33,399 --> 02:21:35,549
We had loads of help from you.

1490
02:21:35,719 --> 02:21:38,791
-We couldn't have done it without you.
-Thanks.

1491
02:21:40,559 --> 02:21:43,392
Could I have your attention. please?

1492
02:21:47,399 --> 02:21:49,788
Before we begin the feast...

1493
02:21:49,959 --> 02:21:55,955
...let us have a round of applause
for Professor Sprout. Madam Pomfrey...

1494
02:21:56,119 --> 02:22:00,078
...whose Mandrake juice has been
so successfully administered...

1495
02:22:00,240 --> 02:22:02,800
...to all who had been Petrified.

1496
02:22:12,880 --> 02:22:15,758
Also. in light of the recent events...

1497
02:22:15,919 --> 02:22:17,989
...as a school treat...

1498
02:22:18,160 --> 02:22:21,948
...all exams have been canceled.

1499
02:22:24,519 --> 02:22:26,032
Oh, no.

1500
02:22:42,279 --> 02:22:44,235
Sorry I'm late.

1501
02:22:50,039 --> 02:22:54,271
The owl that delivered my release papers
got all lost and confused.

1502
02:22:54,599 --> 02:22:57,750
Some ruddy bird called Errol.

1503
02:23:12,880 --> 02:23:18,637
And I'd just like to say that if it hadn't
been for you. Harry and Ron...

1504
02:23:18,839 --> 02:23:21,672
...and Hermione. of course...

1505
02:23:22,320 --> 02:23:26,233
...I would still be you-know-where...

1506
02:23:26,399 --> 02:23:29,835
...so I'd just like to say thanks.

1507
02:23:38,839 --> 02:23:41,672
There's no Hogwarts
without you. Hagrid.
