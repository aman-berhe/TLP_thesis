1
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:32,429
Lumus Maxima.

2
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,279
Lumus Maxima.

3
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,118
Lumus Maxima.

4
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,111
Lumus Maxima.

5
00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:05,830
Lumus Maximal

6
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,553
Harry. Harry.

7
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,631
Harry. open the door.

8
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,470
Marge. How lovely to see--

9
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,911
Uncle Vernon.
I need you to sign this form.

10
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,353
What is it?

11
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:53,555
Nothing. School stuff.

12
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,280
Later perhaps. if you behave.

13
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:58,555
I will if she does.

14
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,712
-Oh. you're still here. are you?
-Yes.

15
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:04,633
Don't say yes
in that ungrateful way.

16
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,676
Damn good of my brother
to keep you.

17
00:02:06,839 --> 00:02:10,991
He'd have been straight to an orphanage
if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.

18
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:15,357
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-pooh?

19
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,238
Give us a kiss. Come on. Up. up.

20
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,595
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.

21
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,636
Okay.

22
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,633
Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy. Rippy-pooh.

23
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:31,432
-Can I tempt you. Marge?
-Just a small one.

24
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:34,472
Excellent nosh. Petunia.

25
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,950
A bit more.

26
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,631
Usually just a fry-up for me.
what with 12 dogs.

27
00:02:40,839 --> 00:02:43,307
Just a bit more. That's a boy.

28
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:48,190
You wanna try
a little drop of brandy?

29
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,239
A little drop of brandy-brandy
windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?

30
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,398
What are you smirking at?

31
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,312
Where did you send the boy.
Vernon?

32
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,671
St. Brutus'. It's a fine
institution for hopeless cases.

33
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,718
Do they use a cane
at St. Brutus'. boy?

34
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,314
Oh. yeah.

35
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,080
Yeah. I've been beaten loads of times.

36
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,708
Excellent. I won't have this
namby-pamby...

37
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,912
...wishy-washy nonsense about
not beating people who deserve it.

38
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:20,071
You mustn't blame yourself
about how this one turned out.

39
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,994
It's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.

40
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,229
What is it the boy's father did.
Petunia?

41
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,278
Nothing. He didn't work.
He was unemployed.

42
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:32,158
-And a drunk too. no doubt?
-That's a lie.

43
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,754
-What did you say?
-My dad wasn't a drunk.

44
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,553
Don't worry. Don't fuss. Petunia.
l have a very firm grip.

45
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,472
I think it's time you went to bed.

46
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,757
Quiet. Vernon. You. clean it up.

47
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:50,957
Actually. it's nothing to do
with the father.

48
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:54,754
It's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.

49
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,799
lf something's wrong with the bitch.
then something's wrong with the pup.

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,592
Shut up! Shut up!

51
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,072
Right.

52
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:09,275
Let me tell you....

53
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,876
Vernon!

54
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:36,517
Vernon! Vernon. do something!

55
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,111
Stop!

56
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,034
I've got you. Marge. I've got you.

57
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:30,236
-Hold on. hold on.
-Get off.

58
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:33,197
-Don't you dare!
-Sorry.

59
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:36,111
Oh. Vernon.

60
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,952
Oh. God.

61
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:39,837
Marge!

62
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,716
Please!

63
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,436
Marge!

64
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,516
Come back!

65
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:20,828
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.

66
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,117
-You put her right!
-No. She deserved what she got.

67
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,552
-Keep away from me.
-You can't do magic outside school.

68
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,637
-Yeah? Try me.
-They won't let you back now.

69
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:32,073
You've nowhere to go.

70
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,470
I don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.

71
00:08:06,679 --> 00:08:08,431
“Welcome to the Knight Bus...

72
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,831
...emergency transport
for the stranded witch or wizard.

73
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,755
My name is Stan Shunpike. and I will be
your conductor for this evening.“

74
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,713
What you doing down there?

75
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,510
-I fell over.
-What you fall over for?

76
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,280
-I didn't do it on purpose.
-Well. come on. then.

77
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:29,549
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.

78
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,312
-What you looking at?
-Nothing.

79
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,152
Well. come on. then. In.

80
00:08:41,319 --> 00:08:44,038
No. no. no. I'll get this.
You get in.

81
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,916
Come on.

82
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,039
Come on. Move on. move on.

83
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,317
-Take her away. Ern.
-Yeah. take it away. Ernie.

84
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,630
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

85
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,030
-What did you say your name was?
-I didn't.

86
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:40,513
-Whereabouts are you headed?
-The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.

87
00:09:40,719 --> 00:09:43,517
You hear that? “The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London.“

88
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,910
The Leaky Cauldron.
If you have pea soup...

89
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,753
...make sure you eat it
before it eats you.

90
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,554
-But the Muggles. Can't they see us?
-Mugg|es?

91
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,392
They don't see nothing. do they?

92
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:58,993
No. but if you jab them
with a fork. they feel.

93
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,592
Ernie. little old lady at 12 o'clock!

94
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:14,433
Ten. nine. eight...

95
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,234
...seven. six. five...

96
00:10:17,439 --> 00:10:19,589
...four. three. three and a half...

97
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,518
...two. one and three quarters.

98
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,598
Yes!

99
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:29,078
Who is that?

100
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,555
That man.

101
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:34,877
Who is that?

102
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:36,512
Who is--?

103
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,995
That is Sirius Black. that is.

104
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:42,676
Don't tell me you've never
been hearing of Sirius Black.

105
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,115
He's a murderer.

106
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,794
Got himself locked up
in Azkaban for it.

107
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,716
-How did he escape?
-Well. that's the question. isn't it?

108
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:54,756
He's the first one that done it.

109
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,194
He was a big supporter of...

110
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,113
...You-Know-Who.

111
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,597
I reckon you've heard of him.

112
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:04,272
Yeah.

113
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,714
Him I've heard of.

114
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,840
Ernie. two double-deckers
at 12 o'clock.

115
00:11:11,319 --> 00:11:12,911
They're getting closer. Ernie.

116
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,830
Ernie. they're right on top of us!

117
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,229
Mind your head.

118
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,796
Hey. guys? Guys?

119
00:11:31,999 --> 00:11:34,069
Why the long faces?

120
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,989
Yeah. yeah. Nearly there. Nearly there.

121
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,471
-The Leaky Cauldron.
-Next stop. Knockturn Alley.

122
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:54,319
Mr. Potter. at last.

123
00:11:57,199 --> 00:11:59,793
-Take it away. Ern.
-Yeah. take it away. Ernie!

124
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,792
Room 11.

125
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,554
Hedwig.

126
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,439
Right smart bird
you got there. Mr. Potter.

127
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,149
He arrived here just
five minutes before yourself.

128
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,470
As Minister for Magic. it is my duty
to inform you. Mr. Potter...

129
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:42,711
...earlier this evening
your uncle's sister was located...

130
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:46,667
...a little south of Sheffield.
circling a chimney stack.

131
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:50,434
The Accidental Magic Reversal
Department was dispatched immediately.

132
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,196
She has been properly punctured
and her memory modified.

133
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,871
She will have no recollection
of the incident whatsoever.

134
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:02,507
So that's that...

135
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:05,432
...and no harm done.

136
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,354
Pea soup?

137
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,556
No. thank you.

138
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,836
-Minister?
-Yes?

139
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,672
-I don't understand.
-Understand?

140
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:17,269
I broke the law. Underage wizards
can't use magic at home.

141
00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:20,357
Come now. The Ministry
doesn't send people to Azkaban...

142
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,954
...for blowing up their aunts.

143
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:31,117
On the other hand. running away
like that. given the state of things...

144
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,635
...was very. very irresponsible.

145
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,469
-“The state of things." sir?
-We have a killer on the loose.

146
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,392
Sirius Black. you mean?

147
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:41,231
But what's he got to do with me?

148
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,070
Nothing. of course. You're safe.
And that's what matters.

149
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,272
And tomorrow you'll be
on your way back to Hogwarts.

150
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,273
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty...

151
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,274
...of having them brought here.
Now Tom will show you to your room.

152
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,154
Hedwig.

153
00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:09,189
Oh. by the way. Harry. Whilst you're
here. it would be best if you didn't...

154
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:11,834
...wander.

155
00:14:13,359 --> 00:14:16,112
Right! You gonna move
that bus or what?

156
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:33,635
Housekeeping.

157
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:39,069
I'll come back later.

158
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:47,712
l'm warning you. Hermione.

159
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,429
Keep that beast away from Scabbers.
or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.

160
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,591
It's a cat. Ronald.
What do you expect?

161
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,638
-|t's in his nature.
-A cat? Is that what they told you?

162
00:15:56,799 --> 00:15:59,233
-Looks like a pig with hair.
-That's rich...

163
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,834
...coming from the owner
of that smelly old shoe brush.

164
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:04,308
Crookshanks. just ignore
the mean little boy.

165
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,033
Harry.

166
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,433
Harry.

167
00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:12,517
-Egypt. What's it like?
-Brilliant. Loads of old stuff...

168
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,917
...like mummies. tombs.
even Scabbers enjoyed himself.

169
00:16:16,119 --> 00:16:19,156
-Egyptians used to worship cats.
-A|ong with the dung beetle.

170
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:22,357
-Not flashing that clipping again?
-I haven't shown anyone.

171
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,829
No. not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.

172
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:26,352
-The day maid.
-Night maid.

173
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,556
-Cook.
-The bloke who fixed the toilet.

174
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,073
-Harry.
-Mrs. Weasley.

175
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,310
-Good to see you. dear.
-Good to see you.

176
00:16:32,479 --> 00:16:33,753
-Got everything?
-Yes.

177
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:35,989
-Yes? All your books?
-|t's all upstairs.

178
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,513
-Your clothes?
-Everything.

179
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:39,032
-Good boy.
-Thank you.

180
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,997
-Harry Potter.
-Mr. Weasley.

181
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,516
-Harry. wonder if I might have a word?
-Yeah. sure.

182
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,234
-Hermione.
-Good morning. Mr. Weasley.

183
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,870
-Looking forward to a new term?
-Yeah. It should be great.

184
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,515
Harry. some within the Ministry
would strongly discourage me...

185
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:00,239
...from divulging what I'm about
to reveal to you.

186
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,597
But I think that you need
to know the facts.

187
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,227
You are in danger.

188
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,235
Grave danger.

189
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,234
Has this anything to do
with Sirius Black. sir?

190
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,315
What do you know
about Sirius Black. Harry?

191
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,029
-Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
-Do you know why?

192
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,393
Thirteen years ago.
when you stopped....

193
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,311
-Vo|demort.
-Don't say his name.

194
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,754
Sorry.

195
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,717
When you stopped You-Know-Who...

196
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,438
...Black lost everything.

197
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,718
But to this day. he still remains
a faithful servant.

198
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,950
And in his mind...

199
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:39,997
...you are the only thing
that stands in the way...

200
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:43,754
...of You-Know-Who
returning to power.

201
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,989
And that is why...

202
00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:48,593
...he has escaped from Azkaban.

203
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,558
To find you.

204
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,518
And kill me.

205
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,000
Harry. swear to me
that whatever you might hear...

206
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,593
...you won't go looking for Black.

207
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,234
Mr. Weasley...

208
00:18:01,399 --> 00:18:05,233
...why would I go looking
for someone who wants to kill me?

209
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,558
Quick. Quick.

210
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,592
Ron. Ron!

211
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:12,270
Oh. for goodness' sake!

212
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,835
Don't lose him!

213
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,831
ldidn't mean to blow her up. ljust--

214
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,355
-I lost control.
-Brilliant.

215
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:23,955
Honestly. Ron. it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.

216
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,792
l was lucky not to be arrested.

217
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,916
I still think it was brilliant.

218
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,710
Come on. Everywhere else is full.

219
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,759
Who do you think that is?

220
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,673
-Professor R.J. Lupin.
-Do you know everything?

221
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,876
How is it she knows everything?

222
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:43,032
-|t's on his suitcase. Ronald.
-Oh.

223
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,471
-Do you think he's really asleep?
-Seems to be. Why?

224
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,156
I gotta tell you something.

225
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:06,037
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban...

226
00:19:06,199 --> 00:19:07,951
-...to come after you?
-Yeah.

227
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,031
But they'll catch Black. won't they?

228
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,794
-I mean. everyone's looking for him.
-Sure.

229
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,157
Except no one's ever broken out
of Azkaban before...

230
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,154
-...and he's a murderous. raving lunatic.
-Thanks. Ron.

231
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:23,117
Why are we stopping?

232
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,792
We can't be there yet.

233
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,996
What's going on?

234
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,760
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.

235
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,830
Ouch. Ron. That was my foot.

236
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,510
There's something moving out there.

237
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,471
I think someone's coming aboard.

238
00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:24,392
Bloody hell! What's happening?

239
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,073
Harry.

240
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,872
Harry. are you all right?

241
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,392
Thank you.

242
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:48,874
Here. eat this. lt'll help.

243
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,396
It's all right. It's chocolate.

244
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,431
What was that thing that came?

245
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:02,875
It was a dementor. One of the guards
of Azkaban. It's gone now.

246
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,633
It was searching the train
for Sirius Black.

247
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:09,269
If you'll excuse me. I need to have
a little word with the driver.

248
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,478
Eat. You'll feel better.

249
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,314
What happened to me?

250
00:22:23,479 --> 00:22:25,151
Well. you sort of went rigid.

251
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,357
We thought maybe you were
having a fit or something.

252
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:31,757
And did either of you two...

253
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,194
...you know...

254
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,318
-...pass out?
-No.

255
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,118
I felt weird. though.

256
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:40,031
Like I'd never be cheerful again.

257
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,356
But someone was screaming.

258
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:44,838
A woman.

259
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:47,670
No one was screaming. Harry.

260
00:23:44,439 --> 00:23:48,034
Welcome! Welcome to another year
at Hogwarts.

261
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,196
Now. I'd like to say a few words...

262
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:54,511
...before we all become too befuddled
by our excellent feast.

263
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:57,796
First. I'm pleased to welcome
Professor R.J. Lupin...

264
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,309
...who's kindly consented
to fill the post...

265
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:02,874
...of Defense Against
the Dark Arts teacher.

266
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,473
Good luck. professor.

267
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,077
Of course. That's why he knew
to give you the chocolate. Harry.

268
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,800
Potter. Is it true you fainted?

269
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,478
-I mean. you actually fainted?
-Shove off. Malfoy.

270
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,551
-How did he find out?
-Just forget it.

271
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,995
Our Care of Magical Creatures
teacher...

272
00:24:24,199 --> 00:24:25,996
...has decided to retire...

273
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,755
...in order to spend more time
with his remaining limbs.

274
00:24:29,959 --> 00:24:32,553
Fortunately.
I'm delighted to announce...

275
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:35,438
...that his place will be taken
by none other...

276
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:39,751
...than our own Rubeus Hagrid.

277
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,232
Finally. on a more disquieting note...

278
00:24:53,439 --> 00:24:55,828
...at the request
of the Ministry of Magic...

279
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:00,989
...Hogwarts will. until further notice.
play host to the dementors of Azkaban...

280
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,950
...until such a time
as Sirius Black is captured.

281
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,395
The dementors will be stationed
at every entrance to the grounds.

282
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:11,151
Now whilst I've been assured...

283
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:14,834
...that their presence will not disrupt
our day-to-day activities...

284
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,274
...a word of caution.

285
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,517
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish...

286
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,956
...between the one they hunt
and the one who gets in their way.

287
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,590
Therefore. I must warn
each and every one of you...

288
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:30,229
...to give them no reason
to harm you.

289
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,875
It is not in the nature
of a dementor to be forgiving.

290
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,071
But you know.
happiness can be found...

291
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:44,710
...even in the darkest of times...

292
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,589
...if one only remembers
to turn on the light.

293
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,031
Furtuna Major.

294
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:08,319
Here. listen.
She just won't let me in.

295
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:11,317
-Furtuna Major.
-No. no. Wait. wait.

296
00:26:11,479 --> 00:26:13,231
Watch this.

297
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:28,314
-Amazing. Just with my voice.
-Fortuna Major.

298
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:31,909
-Yes. all right. Go in.
-Thank you.

299
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,751
Still doing that after three years.

300
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:37,989
-She can't even sing.
-Exact|y.

301
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:41,229
-Hey. man.
-Hey. man.

302
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,559
-Oh. God.
-That's awful.

303
00:26:44,479 --> 00:26:46,549
Green. That's a monkey.

304
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:50,839
-What is that?
-You call that a monkey?

305
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,116
Do not give him one again.

306
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,793
Hey. Neville. try an elephant.

307
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:04,271
-Ron. catch.
-I will.

308
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,278
I think we have a winner.

309
00:27:12,199 --> 00:27:14,429
-Oh. don't try one of them.
-Oh. no.

310
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:17,428
Look at him. His face.

311
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,430
Welcome, my children.

312
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:06,508
In this room. you shall explore
the noble art of Divination.

313
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:11,753
In this room. you shall discover
if you possess the Sight.

314
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,908
Hello. I am Professor Trelawney.

315
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:21,517
Together we shall cast ourselves
into the future.

316
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,395
This term. we'll focus on Tasseomancy.
the art of reading tea leaves.

317
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,996
So please. take the cup
of the person sitting opposite you.

318
00:28:29,479 --> 00:28:30,798
What do you see?

319
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:36,398
The truth lies buried like a sentence
deep within a book. waiting to be read.

320
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,909
But first. you must broaden
your minds.

321
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:43,436
-First. you must look beyond.
-What a load of rubbish.

322
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,431
-Where did you come from?
-Me?

323
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,160
-|'ve been here all this time.
-You. boy....

324
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:50,514
Is your grandmother quite well?

325
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:52,558
I think so.

326
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,393
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.

327
00:28:58,279 --> 00:28:59,598
Pity.

328
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:02,313
Broaden your minds.

329
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:08,956
Your aura is pulsing. dear.
Are you in the beyond?

330
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,951
-I think you are.
-Sure.

331
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,276
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.

332
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,078
Yeah.

333
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:20,112
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.

334
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,029
And that there could be the sun
and that's happiness.

335
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,514
So...

336
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,559
...you're gonna suffer.
but you're gonna be happy about it.

337
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:31,033
Give me the cup.

338
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:35,316
Oh. my dear boy.

339
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,912
My dear...

340
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:43,477
...you have the Grim.

341
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,952
The Grin? What's the Grin?

342
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,873
Not the Grin. you idiot. The Grim.

343
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,109
“Taking form of a giant spectral dog.

344
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:53,674
lt's among the darkest omens
in our world.

345
00:29:54,199 --> 00:29:55,791
It's an omen...

346
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,712
...of death.“

347
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:05,714
You don't think that Grim thing's
got anything to do with Sirius Black?

348
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,668
Oh. honestly. Ron. If you ask me.
Divination's a woolly discipline.

349
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,355
Now. Ancient Runes.
that's a fascinating subject.

350
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:16,511
Ancient Runes? Exactly how many
classes are you taking?

351
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:18,271
A fair few.

352
00:30:18,439 --> 00:30:20,430
Hang on. That's not possible.

353
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,273
Ancient Runes is in the
same time as Divination.

354
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,351
You have to be in two
classes at once.

355
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:28,750
Don't be silly. How could anyone
be in two classes at once?

356
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:32,992
“Broaden your minds. Use your
lnner Eye to see the future.“

357
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:37,908
That's it. Come on. now. Come closer.
Less talking. if you don't mind.

358
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,832
I got a real treat for you today.

359
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,911
A great lesson. So follow me.

360
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,678
Right. you lot. Less chattering.
Form a group over there.

361
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,229
And open your books to page 49.

362
00:30:58,399 --> 00:30:59,957
Exactly how do we do that?

363
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,869
Just stroke the spine. of course.
Goodness me.

364
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,509
-Don't be such a wimp. Longbottom.
-|'m okay. Okay.

365
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:23,111
-I think they're funny.
-Oh. yeah. Terribly funny.

366
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,675
Witty. God. this place
has gone to the dogs.

367
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:29,395
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's
got this oaf teaching classes.

368
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:31,593
Shut up. Malfoy.

369
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,475
Dementor! Dementor!

370
00:31:55,159 --> 00:31:58,117
-Just ignore him.
-You're supposed to stroke it.

371
00:31:58,279 --> 00:31:59,678
Yeah.

372
00:32:09,479 --> 00:32:12,357
lsn't he beautiful?

373
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:15,033
Say hello to Buckbeak.

374
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:17,749
Hagrid. exactly what is that?

375
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,916
That. Ron. is a hippogriff.

376
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,436
First thing you wanna know
is they're very proud creatures.

377
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,349
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.

378
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,158
It may be the last thing you ever do.

379
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:33,550
Now. who'd like to come
and say hello?

380
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,991
Well done. Harry. Well done.

381
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:41,998
Come on now.

382
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:43,793
Now...

383
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,549
...you have to let him make the first
move. It's only polite. So...

384
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,517
...step up. Give him a nice bow.

385
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,029
Then you wait
and see if he bows back.

386
00:32:52,199 --> 00:32:54,235
If he does. you can go and touch him.

387
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,471
If not-- Well.
we'll get to that later.

388
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,996
Just make your bow.

389
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,111
Nice and low.

390
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,832
Back off. Harry. Back off.

391
00:33:13,639 --> 00:33:15,072
Keep still.

392
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:18,590
Keep still.

393
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,672
Well done. Harry. Well done.
Here. you big brute. you.

394
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,514
Right. I think you can go
and pat him now.

395
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,472
Go on. Don't be shy.

396
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:47,914
Nice and slow. now.
Nice and slow. Slow.

397
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,473
Not so fast. Harry.

398
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:00,476
Slow down. Harry. That's it....

399
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:03,716
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.

400
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,749
Slowly. now. slowly. slowly....

401
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,678
That's it....

402
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,554
Yes!

403
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:15,395
Well done! Well done. Harry.
well done!

404
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,471
Does he get to fly?

405
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,955
-I think he may let you ride him now.
-What?

406
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,638
-Come on.
-Hey. hey. hey!

407
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,837
Put you over here.
just behind the wing joint.

408
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,678
Don't pull out any of his feathers.
because he won't thank you for that.

409
00:36:06,479 --> 00:36:09,835
Well done. Harry. and well done.
Buckbeak.

410
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,871
That was wicked. Harry!

411
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:13,398
Oh. please.

412
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:16,389
Well done. well done.

413
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,112
-How am I doing me first day?
-Brilliant. professor.

414
00:36:23,399 --> 00:36:27,438
You're not dangerous at all. are you.
you great ugly brute!

415
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:28,958
Malfoy. no....

416
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,238
No!

417
00:36:31,919 --> 00:36:33,477
Buckbeak!

418
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:35,715
Whoa. whoa. whoa. . ..

419
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,558
Whoa! Buckbeak!

420
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:41,869
Away. you silly creature....

421
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:45,037
-|t's killed me!
-Calm down. It's just a scratch!

422
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,389
Hagrid!

423
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:51,554
-He has to be taken to the hospital.
-|'m the teacher. I'll do it.

424
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:57,232
-You're gonna regret this.
-C|ass dismissed!

425
00:36:57,399 --> 00:36:59,594
You and your bloody chicken!

426
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,076
Does it hurt terribly. Draco?

427
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,955
It comes and it goes.
Still. I consider myself lucky.

428
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:31,316
Madam Pomfrey said another minute
and I could've lost my arm.

429
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,393
-I can't do homework for weeks.
-Listen to the idiot.

430
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,713
-He's really laying it on thick. isn't he?
-At least Hagrid didn't get fired.

431
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:42,469
I hear Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.

432
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:44,431
-He's been sighted!
-Who?

433
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:46,277
Sirius Black!

434
00:37:47,279 --> 00:37:50,157
Dufftown? That's not far from here.

435
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:53,073
You don't think he'd come
to Hogwarts. do you?

436
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,629
-With dementors at every entrance?
-Dementors?

437
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,997
He slipped past them once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?

438
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:03,556
That's right. Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.

439
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,357
Like trying to catch smoke
with your bare hands.

440
00:38:32,399 --> 00:38:34,390
Intriguing. isn't it?

441
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,159
Would anyone like to venture
a guess...

442
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,038
...as to what is inside?

443
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:46,074
-That's a boggart. that is.
-Very good. Mr. Thomas.

444
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,598
Now. can anybody tell me
what a boggart looks like?

445
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,756
-No one knows.
-When did she get here?

446
00:38:51,959 --> 00:38:53,392
Boggarts are shape-shifters.

447
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,671
They take the shape of whatever
a person fears the most.

448
00:38:56,879 --> 00:39:01,111
-That's what makes them so--
-So terrifying. yes. yes. yes....

449
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:06,553
Luckily. a very simple charm exists
to repel a boggart.

450
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:11,474
Let's practice it now.
Without wands. please.

451
00:39:11,759 --> 00:39:14,148
After me. Riddikulus!

452
00:39:14,359 --> 00:39:16,395
-Riddikulus!
-Ve ry g ood .

453
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:18,988
A little louder and very clear.
Listen:

454
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,316
-Riddilrulus !
-Riddilrulus !

455
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,511
-This class is ridiculous.
-Very good.

456
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:27,553
So much for the easy part. You see.
the incantation alone is not enough.

457
00:39:27,759 --> 00:39:31,308
What really finishes a boggart
is laughter.

458
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,752
You need to force it to assume
a shape you find truly amusing.

459
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,879
Let me explain. Neville.
would you join me. please?

460
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:42,309
Come on. don't be shy. Come on.

461
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,872
Come on.

462
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:48,676
Hello. Neville. what frightens you
most of all?

463
00:39:48,879 --> 00:39:50,471
Professor Snape.

464
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,431
-Sorry?
-Professor Snape.

465
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:55,875
Professor Snape. Yes. frightens all.

466
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:00,352
-You live with your grandmother.
-I don't want it to turn into her. either.

467
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:02,352
No...

468
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:05,832
...it won't. I want you
to picture her clothes.

469
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:09,151
Only her clothes. very clearly.
in your mind.

470
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:12,317
-She carries a red handbag--
-We don't need to hear.

471
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,189
As long as you see it. we'll see it.
Now. when | open that wardrobe...

472
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,551
...here's what I want
you to do. Excuse me.

473
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,798
Imagine Professor Snape
in your grandmother's clothes.

474
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,638
Can you do that?

475
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,794
Yes. Wand at the ready.

476
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:31,476
One. two. three.

477
00:40:40,879 --> 00:40:42,676
Think. Neville. think.

478
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,276
Riddikulus !

479
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:54,199
Wonderful. Neville. wonderful!
Incredible! Okay...

480
00:40:54,399 --> 00:40:57,197
...to the back. Neville.
Everyone. form a line....

481
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:04,433
Form a line!

482
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:07,875
I want everyone to picture the thing
they fear the very most...

483
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,037
...and turn it into something funny.

484
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,878
Next! Ron!

485
00:41:15,959 --> 00:41:19,349
Concentrate. Face your fear.
Be brave!

486
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:31,838
Wand at the ready. Ron.

487
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:34,311
Riddikulus !

488
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,754
Yes!

489
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:39,112
You see? Very good. very good!

490
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:45,196
Marvelous! Absolutely. very. very
enjoyable! Parvati! Next!

491
00:41:46,919 --> 00:41:49,035
Show us what you see.

492
00:41:57,919 --> 00:42:01,195
Keep your nerve. Steady.

493
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,236
Riddikulus !

494
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,117
And next! Step up. step up!

495
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,912
Wonderful. wonderful!

496
00:42:22,359 --> 00:42:24,395
Here!

497
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,752
Riddikulus !

498
00:42:39,919 --> 00:42:42,717
Right. Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.

499
00:42:42,879 --> 00:42:44,790
Collect your books from the back.

500
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,474
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you! Sorry!

501
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:50,551
Sorry. you can have too much
of a good thing.

502
00:42:52,479 --> 00:42:56,870
Remember. these visits to Hogsmeade
village are a privilege.

503
00:42:57,159 --> 00:42:59,878
Should your behavior reflect poorly
on the school...

504
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,838
...that privilege shall not
be extended again.

505
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,431
No permission form signed.
no visiting the village.

506
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:08,078
That's the rule. Potter.

507
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,352
Those with permission. follow me.
Those without. stay put.

508
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,909
I thought if you signed it.
then I could--

509
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:16,468
I can't. Only a parent
or a guardian can sign.

510
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:19,711
Since I am neither.
it would be inappropriate.

511
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,311
I'm sorry. Potter.
That's my final word.

512
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:30,596
Forget about it. guys. See you later.

513
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:45,795
Professor. can I ask you something?

514
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,675
You want to know why I stopped you
facing that boggart. yes?

515
00:43:49,879 --> 00:43:51,232
I thought it'd be obvious.

516
00:43:51,399 --> 00:43:54,118
I assumed it would take the shape
of Lord Voldemort.

517
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,636
I did think of Voldemort at first.

518
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,353
But then I remembered that night
on the train...

519
00:44:00,519 --> 00:44:02,953
-...and the dementor.
-|'m very impressed.

520
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,872
That suggests what you fear the most
is fear itself.

521
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,473
This is very wise.

522
00:44:07,639 --> 00:44:09,630
Before I fainted...

523
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,791
...I heard something.

524
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,878
A woman...

525
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,594
...screaming.

526
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,917
Dementors force us to relive
our very worst memories.

527
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,917
Our pain becomes their power.

528
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:24,835
I think it was my mother...

529
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,116
...the night she was murdered.

530
00:44:28,679 --> 00:44:32,957
The very first time I saw you. Harry.
I recognized you immediately.

531
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:36,238
Not by your scar. by your eyes.

532
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:38,709
They're your mother. Lily's.

533
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:40,998
Yes.

534
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,198
Oh. yes. I knew her.

535
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,115
Your mother was there for me
at a time when no one else was.

536
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:53,392
Not only was she
a singularly gifted witch...

537
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:56,757
...she was also
an uncommonly kind woman.

538
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:00,198
She had a way of seeing
the beauty in others...

539
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:06,275
...even. and most especially. when that
person could not see it in themselves.

540
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:10,273
And your father. James.
on the other hand...

541
00:45:10,439 --> 00:45:11,918
...he....

542
00:45:12,399 --> 00:45:15,596
He had a certain. shall we say.
talent for trouble.

543
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:23,079
A talent. rumor has it.
he passed on to you.

544
00:45:26,919 --> 00:45:29,752
You're more like them
than you know. Harry.

545
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,552
In time. you'll come to see
just how much.

546
00:45:36,879 --> 00:45:41,077
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant.
but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.

547
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,714
We never got to go
to the Shrieking Shack.

548
00:45:43,879 --> 00:45:47,758
-You heard it's the most--
-Haunted building in Britain. I know.

549
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,512
What's going on?

550
00:45:50,679 --> 00:45:53,034
Probably Neville forgot
the password again.

551
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,509
-Hey.
-Oh. you're there.

552
00:45:55,679 --> 00:45:59,797
Let me through. please.
Excuse me! I'm Head Boy!

553
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:02,951
Get back. all of you.

554
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:06,156
No one is to enter this dormitory
until it's been searched.

555
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,594
The Fat Lady! She's gone!

556
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:11,954
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.

557
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,951
It's not funny. Ron.

558
00:46:15,879 --> 00:46:19,792
Keep calm. everyone. Break into fours.
Back to your common room.

559
00:46:25,879 --> 00:46:26,868
-Be quiet.
-Make way.

560
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:28,956
-The headmaster's here.
-Come on. move.

561
00:46:29,159 --> 00:46:30,956
You heard. Move!

562
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:47,352
Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.

563
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:51,592
Tell them to search every painting
in the castle to find the Fat Lady.

564
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,758
There's no need for ghosts. professor.

565
00:46:55,559 --> 00:46:57,595
The Fat Lady's there.

566
00:46:58,399 --> 00:47:00,310
Mind where you're going! Slow down!

567
00:47:00,879 --> 00:47:03,439
You listen! I'm Head Boy!

568
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:05,908
-Come back here!
-Keep moving!

569
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,112
Dear lady. who did this to you?

570
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:18,795
Eyes like the devil. he's got.
and a soul as dark as his name.

571
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:22,557
It's him. headmaster.
The one they all talk about.

572
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:25,074
He's here. somewhere in the castle!

573
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,390
Sirius Black!

574
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:32,514
Secure the castle. Mr. Filch.
The rest of you. to the Great Hall.

575
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:04,150
I've searched the Astronomy Tower
and the Owlery. There's nothing there.

576
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,788
-Thank you.
-The third floor's clear too. sir.

577
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,837
-Very good.
-|'ve done the dungeons.

578
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,560
No sign of Black. nor anywhere else
in the castle.

579
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,149
I didn't really expect him to linger.

580
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,589
Remarkable feat. don't you think?

581
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,955
To enter Hogwarts Castle
on one's own...

582
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:22,680
-...comp|ete|y undetected?
-Ouite remarkable. yes.

583
00:48:22,879 --> 00:48:24,631
Any theories on how he managed it?

584
00:48:24,839 --> 00:48:27,672
Many. Each as unlikely as the next.

585
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,399
You may recall...

586
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:32,279
...prior to the start of term
I expressed concerns...

587
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,431
...about your appointment
of Professor--

588
00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:38,512
Not a single professor inside this castle
would help Sirius Black enter it.

589
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,989
I'm quite convinced
the castle is safe...

590
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:44,630
...and I'm more than willing to send
the students to their houses.

591
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,030
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?

592
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,754
Perhaps. But for now. let him sleep.

593
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:55,116
For in dreams. we enter a world
that's entirely our own.

594
00:48:55,400 --> 00:49:01,635
Let them swim in the deepest ocean
or glide over the highest cloud.

595
00:49:37,439 --> 00:49:40,636
Turn to page 394.

596
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:53,115
Excuse me. sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?

597
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:57,076
That's not really your concern.
is it. Potter?

598
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,949
Suffice it to say your professor
finds himself incapable of teaching...

599
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:05,995
...at the present time.
Turn to page 394.

600
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:12,231
“Werewolves“?

601
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:15,198
Sir. we just learned about red caps
and hinkypunks.

602
00:50:15,439 --> 00:50:18,431
-We're not meant to start that for weeks.
-Ouiet.

603
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:21,676
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?

604
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:25,636
Now. which one of you
can tell me the difference...

605
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:28,148
...between an Animagus
and a werewolf?

606
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,671
No one?

607
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,958
-How disappointing.
-Please. sir.

608
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:37,196
An Animagus is a wizard
who elects to turn into an animal.

609
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:38,838
A werewolf has no choice.

610
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,878
With each full moon...

611
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,749
...he no longer remembers who he is.
He'd kill his best friend.

612
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:48,395
The werewolf only responds
to the call of its own kind.

613
00:50:49,519 --> 00:50:52,158
Thank you. Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time...

614
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:54,549
...you've spoken out of turn.
Miss Granger.

615
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:56,630
Are you incapable
of restraining yourself...

616
00:50:56,799 --> 00:50:59,996
...or do you take pride
in being an insufferable know-it-all?

617
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:03,556
-He's got a point. you know.
-Five points from Gryffindor.

618
00:51:03,759 --> 00:51:08,150
As an antidote to your ignorance.
and on my desk. by Monday morning...

619
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:11,909
...two rolls of parchment
on the werewolf. with emphasis...

620
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,548
-...on recognizing it.
-|t's Ouidditch tomorrow.

621
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,797
Then I suggest you take extra care.
Mr. Potter.

622
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:22,879
Loss of limb will not excuse you.

623
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,675
Page 394.

624
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:29,999
The term “werewolf“ . ..

625
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:35,192
...is a contraction
of the Anglo-Saxon word “wer“...

626
00:51:35,919 --> 00:51:40,151
...which means “man." and “wolf.“
Werewolf. man-wolf.

627
00:51:40,799 --> 00:51:43,029
There are several ways
to become a werewolf.

628
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:46,118
They include being given the power
of shape-shifting...

629
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:48,191
...being bitten by a werewolf....

630
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:09,709
Go. Harry! Go. Harry!

631
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:07,319
Aresto momentum!

632
00:54:09,479 --> 00:54:12,471
-He looks a bit peaky. doesn't he?
-Peaky?

633
00:54:12,639 --> 00:54:14,834
What do you expect?
He fell over 100 feet.

634
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,753
Let's walk you off a tower
and see what you look like.

635
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,872
Probably a right sight better
than he normally does.

636
00:54:24,399 --> 00:54:27,232
-How are you feeling?
-Oh. brilliant.

637
00:54:27,439 --> 00:54:29,316
You gave us a right good scare.

638
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:32,916
-What happened?
-Well. you fell off your broom.

639
00:54:33,199 --> 00:54:35,429
Really? I meant the match. Who won?

640
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:41,317
No one blames you. Harry.

641
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:45,194
Dementors aren't supposed to be
on the grounds. Dumbledore's furious.

642
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,391
After he saved you.
he sent them off.

643
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:51,075
There's something else
you should know too.

644
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:57,674
When you fell. your broom sort of blew
into the Whomping Willow. and....

645
00:54:58,159 --> 00:54:59,592
Well....

646
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,995
I'm sorry to hear
about your broomstick.

647
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:05,834
Is there no chance of fixing it?

648
00:55:05,999 --> 00:55:07,318
No.

649
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:10,677
Professor. why do the dementors
affect me so?

650
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:14,038
-I mean. more than everyone else?
-Listen.

651
00:55:14,199 --> 00:55:17,236
Dementors are the foulest creatures
to walk this earth.

652
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:21,512
They feed on every good feeling.
every happy memory...

653
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:26,431
...until a person is left with absolutely
nothing but his worst experiences.

654
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:30,678
You are not weak. Harry.

655
00:55:30,839 --> 00:55:34,752
Dementors affect you most because
there are true horrors in your past.

656
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,918
Horrors your classmates
can scarcely imagine.

657
00:55:38,359 --> 00:55:40,554
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

658
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:44,639
-|'m scared. professor.
-|'d consider you a fool if you weren't.

659
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:48,155
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.

660
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,231
You made the one
on the train go away.

661
00:55:50,439 --> 00:55:52,111
There was only one that night.

662
00:55:52,399 --> 00:55:56,790
-But you made it go away.
-I don't pretend to be an expert. Harry.

663
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:01,874
But as the dementors seem
to have developed an interest in you...

664
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:05,555
...perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays.

665
00:56:05,719 --> 00:56:07,550
For now. I need to rest.

666
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:36,078
Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on. now!

667
00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:52,950
-Guys. let me go.
-C|ever. Harry.

668
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,918
-But not clever enough.
-We've got a better way.

669
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,798
-|'m trying to get to Hogsmeade.
-We know.

670
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,109
We'll get you there.

671
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:02,874
-We'll show you a quicker way.
-If you pipe down.

672
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:06,475
-B|ess him.
-Let me go! Come on. guys. Don't--

673
00:57:07,079 --> 00:57:09,547
-Now. Harry.
-Come and join the big boys.

674
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,956
What are you doing?!

675
00:57:13,199 --> 00:57:15,918
-What's this rubbish?
-“What's this rubbish?“ he says.

676
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:19,277
-|t's the secret to our success.
-|t's a wrench giving it to you--

677
00:57:19,439 --> 00:57:22,237
But we've decided
your needs are greater than ours.

678
00:57:22,399 --> 00:57:24,071
George. if you will.

679
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,391
I solemnly swear
that I am up to no good.

680
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:34,315
“Messrs. Moony. Wormtail.
Padfoot and Prongs...

681
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:37,552
...are proud to present
the Marauder's Map.“

682
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,950
We owe them so much.

683
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:47,035
Hang on. This is Hogwarts.
And that--

684
00:57:47,199 --> 00:57:49,554
-No. Is that really--?
-Dumb|edore.

685
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:50,994
-In his study.
-Pacing.

686
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:53,037
Does that a lot.

687
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,992
-So this map shows--
-Everyone.

688
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:57,110
-Where they are.
-What they're doing.

689
00:57:57,279 --> 00:57:58,348
-Every minute.
-Every day.

690
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:01,398
-Brilliant! Where did you get it?
-From Filch's office.

691
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:04,199
-First year.
-There are seven secret passageways...

692
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:06,920
-...out of the castle.
-We'd recommend this one.

693
00:58:07,079 --> 00:58:10,116
-The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
-Leads you to Honeyduke's.

694
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:12,032
Hurry. Filch is heading this way.

695
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:15,476
And don't forget. When you're done.
just give it a tap and say:

696
00:58:15,639 --> 00:58:19,791
“Mischief managed.“
Otherwise. anyone can read it.

697
00:58:53,679 --> 00:58:55,795
Now. how much do you want?

698
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,631
Delicious.

699
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:16,232
It's meant to be the most haunted
building in Britain. Did I mention that?

700
00:59:16,399 --> 00:59:17,991
Twice.

701
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,910
Do you want to move a bit closer?

702
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:22,758
To the Shrieking Shack?

703
00:59:23,039 --> 00:59:25,792
Actually. I'm fine here.

704
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:27,712
Well. well. Look who's here.

705
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:30,275
You two shopping for your new
dream home?

706
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:34,598
Bit grand for you. isn't it. Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?

707
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:37,871
-Shut your mouth. Malfoy.
-Not very friendly.

708
00:59:38,159 --> 00:59:43,074
Boys. I think it's time we teach
Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.

709
00:59:43,279 --> 00:59:46,555
-Hope you don't mean yourself.
-How dare you talk to me!

710
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:48,630
You filthy little mudblood!

711
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,159
Who is that?

712
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:02,394
-Don't stand there! Do something!
-What?

713
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,595
What's up. Malfoy? Lost your skis?

714
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,753
Get out of the way!

715
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,478
Move!

716
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:33,798
Malfoy! Wait! Wait!

717
01:00:37,399 --> 01:00:39,276
Harry!

718
01:00:39,439 --> 01:00:43,318
Bloody hell. Harry.
That was not funny.

719
01:00:44,439 --> 01:00:47,556
Those weasels! Never told me
about any Marauder's Map.

720
01:00:47,759 --> 01:00:51,035
He won't keep it. He'll turn it over
to Professor McGonagall.

721
01:00:51,279 --> 01:00:55,067
-Aren't you?
-Sure. Along with his Invisibility Cloak.

722
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:57,629
Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta.

723
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:00,035
-Ron fancies her.
-That's not true!

724
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,997
-Professor McGonagall!
-Corne|ius!

725
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:03,478
Allow me. minister.

726
01:01:03,679 --> 01:01:05,431
-Oh. Hagrid....
-Sorry about that.

727
01:01:05,639 --> 01:01:08,437
Rosmerta. my dear.
I hope business is good.

728
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:12,349
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry
wasn't sending dementors...

729
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:16,399
-...into my pub every other night!
-We have....

730
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:19,871
-We have a killer on the loose.
-Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!

731
01:01:20,199 --> 01:01:22,554
And what would bring him here?

732
01:01:22,719 --> 01:01:26,712
-Harry Potter.
-Harry Potter?

733
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:28,552
Come.

734
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,911
Harry!

735
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:44,597
-No underage wizards allowed in today!
-Shut the damn door!

736
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:46,711
-So rude.
-Thick heads.

737
01:01:46,959 --> 01:01:48,472
-Thick heads?!
-How dare they!

738
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:51,717
-Who are they calling thick heads?
-Young whippersnappers!

739
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:56,194
Nobody will come to a pub where
they'll get scared out of their wits.

740
01:01:56,359 --> 01:02:00,113
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want
dementors around the place.

741
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,518
Tell me what this is all about.

742
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:08,957
Years ago. when Harry Potter's parents
realized they were marked for death--

743
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:11,680
Remember? They hid.
Few knew where they were.

744
01:02:11,879 --> 01:02:15,554
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.

745
01:02:15,759 --> 01:02:18,831
Not only did Black lead him
to the Potters that night...

746
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,231
...he also killed Peter Pettigrew!

747
01:02:22,479 --> 01:02:24,549
-Peter Pettigrew?
-Little lump of a boy.

748
01:02:24,719 --> 01:02:26,869
-Always trailing after Black.
-I remember.

749
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:28,792
Never let James and Sirius
out of his sight.

750
01:02:28,959 --> 01:02:31,598
-What happened?
-Peter tried to warn the Potters...

751
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:35,753
...and might have. had he not
run into an old friend. Sirius Black.

752
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:39,635
Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.

753
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,910
He destroyed him!

754
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:47,071
A finger. That's all that was left.
A finger. Nothing else.

755
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:50,152
Sirius Black may not have
put his hands to the Potters...

756
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:53,391
-...but he's the reason they're dead.
-He wants to finish things.

757
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:56,319
-I don't believe it.
-That's not the worst of it.

758
01:02:56,519 --> 01:03:00,114
-What could be worse?
-This: Sirius Black was...

759
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:02,356
...and remains to this day...

760
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:04,358
...Harry Potter's godfather!

761
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:14,834
Ron. look!

762
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:22,787
-Sorry. Excuse me. excuse me.
-Merry Christmas.

763
01:03:59,679 --> 01:04:01,431
Harry. what happened?

764
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,876
He was their friend...

765
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:08,510
...and he betrayed them.

766
01:04:09,279 --> 01:04:11,156
He was their friend!

767
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:15,197
I hope he finds me.

768
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:18,030
Because when he does.
I'm gonna be ready!

769
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:20,993
When he does. I'm gonna kill him!

770
01:04:34,679 --> 01:04:36,237
Harry.

771
01:04:36,719 --> 01:04:38,311
There you are. You came.

772
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:42,389
Are you sure about this. Harry?
This is very advanced magic...

773
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:44,915
...well beyond the Ordinary
Wizarding Level.

774
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:46,559
I'm sure.

775
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:49,475
Well. everything's prepared.

776
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:52,951
The spell I'm going to teach you
is called the Patronus Charm.

777
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:54,559
Did you ever hear of it?

778
01:04:54,719 --> 01:04:56,311
No? Well....

779
01:04:56,479 --> 01:04:59,915
A Patronus is a positive force.
For the wizard who conjures one...

780
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:04,550
...it works like a shield. with the
dementor feeding on it rather than him.

781
01:05:04,719 --> 01:05:08,394
But in order for it to work.
you need to think of a memory.

782
01:05:08,559 --> 01:05:12,347
Not just any memory. a very happy
memory. a very powerful memory.

783
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:16,189
Can you do this?
Yes. Very well.

784
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:19,476
Close your eyes.

785
01:05:21,199 --> 01:05:22,996
Concentrate.

786
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,191
Explore your past.

787
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:28,477
Do you have a memory?

788
01:05:29,999 --> 01:05:32,115
Allow it to fill you up.

789
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,791
Lose yourself within it.

790
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:40,240
Then speak the incantation.
Expecto Patronum.

791
01:05:40,639 --> 01:05:43,358
-Expecto Patronum.
-Very good.

792
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,197
Shall we? Wand at the ready.

793
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,798
Expecto Patronum!

794
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:13,754
Expecto.... Expecto....

795
01:06:13,999 --> 01:06:15,637
Expect. . . .

796
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:21,473
Here we go. Come on.
Sit up. Deep breaths.

797
01:06:21,759 --> 01:06:25,388
It's all right. I didn't expect you
to do it the first time.

798
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:30,715
That would have been remarkable.
Here. eat this. You'll feel better.

799
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:34,273
-That's one nasty dementor.
-Oh. no. no. no.

800
01:06:34,479 --> 01:06:37,118
That was a boggart. Harry.
A boggart.

801
01:06:37,279 --> 01:06:40,316
The real thing would be worse.
Much. much worse.

802
01:06:40,479 --> 01:06:42,993
As a matter of interest.
what were you thinking?

803
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:46,709
-Which memory did you choose?
-The first time I rode a broom.

804
01:06:47,879 --> 01:06:51,076
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.

805
01:06:57,679 --> 01:07:02,707
There's another.
It's not happy. exactly.

806
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:06,595
Well. it is.

807
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:09,228
It's the happiest I've ever felt...

808
01:07:09,399 --> 01:07:13,187
-...but it's complicated.
-|s it strong?

809
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:20,119
Then let's give it a try. You feel ready?

810
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:23,512
Just do it.

811
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:36,277
Expecto Patronum!

812
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:41,268
Expecto Patronum!

813
01:08:01,999 --> 01:08:03,034
Yes!

814
01:08:04,919 --> 01:08:08,195
Well done. Harry. Well done!

815
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:12,679
-I think I've had enough for today.
-Yes. Sit down. Here.

816
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:15,149
Eat this. it helps. It really helps.

817
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:17,038
And just so you know. Harry...

818
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:21,034
...I think you'd have given your father
a run for his money. And that...

819
01:08:21,199 --> 01:08:23,155
...is saying something.

820
01:08:25,239 --> 01:08:27,150
I was thinking of him.

821
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:29,390
And Mum.

822
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:31,710
Seeing their faces.

823
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:34,913
They were talking to me.

824
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:37,230
Just talking.

825
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:39,630
That's the memory I chose.

826
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,555
I don't even know if it's real.

827
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:46,110
But it's the best I have.

828
01:08:54,959 --> 01:08:57,189
-Beautifu| day.
-Gorgeous.

829
01:08:57,359 --> 01:08:59,270
Unless you've been ripped to pieces!

830
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:01,748
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?

831
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:04,957
-Rona|d has lost his rat.
-I haven't lost anything!

832
01:09:05,119 --> 01:09:07,155
-Your cat killed him!
-Rubbish.

833
01:09:07,319 --> 01:09:10,516
Harry. you've seen the way
that bloodthirsty beast of hers...

834
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:14,434
...is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone.

835
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:17,353
Well. maybe you should
take better care of your pets!

836
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,511
-Your cat killed him!
-Did not.

837
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:21,112
-Did.
-Didn't.

838
01:09:23,079 --> 01:09:25,593
How did it go. Hagrid? The hearing?

839
01:09:25,759 --> 01:09:28,910
Well. first off. the committee members
took turns...

840
01:09:29,079 --> 01:09:31,639
...talking about why we were there.

841
01:09:33,439 --> 01:09:35,999
I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak...

842
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:38,993
...was a good hippogriff.
always cleaned his feathers.

843
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:42,112
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well. you can imagine.

844
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:45,352
He said Buckbeak was a deadly
and dangerous creature...

845
01:09:45,519 --> 01:09:48,431
...who would kill you
as soon as look at you.

846
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,358
And then?

847
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:53,634
And then he asked for the worst.
did old Lucius.

848
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:57,759
-They're not sacking you!
-No. I'm not sacked.

849
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:02,638
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!

850
01:10:28,319 --> 01:10:33,712
Spiders! There's-- There's spiders.
Spiders. They want me to tap-dance.

851
01:10:33,919 --> 01:10:36,353
-I don't wanna tap-dance!
-Te|| those spiders.

852
01:10:36,559 --> 01:10:40,347
Right. yeah. Tell them. I'll tell them....

853
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:59,830
-Peter Pettigrew?
-Little lump of a boy.

854
01:10:59,999 --> 01:11:02,991
-Always trailing alter Sirius Black.
-Elaclr was vicious.

855
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:05,555
He didn 't kill Pettigre w,
he destroyed him!

856
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:16,630
-Put that light out!
-Sorry.

857
01:11:58,119 --> 01:12:02,078
-Watch it there. boy.
-We're trying to sleep here!

858
01:12:09,959 --> 01:12:12,427
Mischief managed. Nox.

859
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:15,834
Potter.

860
01:12:15,999 --> 01:12:19,355
What are you doing
wandering the corridors at night?

861
01:12:19,519 --> 01:12:20,634
I was sleepwalking.

862
01:12:20,799 --> 01:12:23,233
How extraordinarily like your father
you are. Potter.

863
01:12:23,399 --> 01:12:27,950
He. too. was exceedingly arrogant.
strutting about the castle.

864
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:32,311
My dad didn't strut. And nor do I.

865
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:35,998
If you don't mind. I would appreciate
it if you could lower your wand.

866
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:41,152
Turn out your pockets.

867
01:12:42,759 --> 01:12:45,273
Turn out your pockets!

868
01:12:48,079 --> 01:12:49,637
What's this?

869
01:12:49,799 --> 01:12:52,916
-Spare bit of parchment.
-Rea|ly? Open it.

870
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:02,755
Reveal your secrets.

871
01:13:06,399 --> 01:13:07,798
Read it.

872
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:15,439
“Messrs. Moony. Wormtail. Padfoot.
and Prongs...

873
01:13:15,599 --> 01:13:19,558
...offer their compliments
to Professor Snape and....“

874
01:13:19,839 --> 01:13:21,272
Go on.

875
01:13:22,399 --> 01:13:26,108
“And request he keep his large nose
out of other people's business.“

876
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:28,754
-You insolent little--
-Professor!

877
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:32,914
Well. well. Lupin.

878
01:13:33,079 --> 01:13:37,595
Out for a little walk
in the moonlight. are we?

879
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:41,229
Harry. are you all right?

880
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:43,795
That remains to be seen.

881
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:48,195
I have now just confiscated
a rather curious artifact.

882
01:13:48,359 --> 01:13:51,749
Take a look. Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise.

883
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:56,516
-C|early. it's full of dark magic.
-I seriously doubt it. Severus.

884
01:13:56,680 --> 01:14:00,036
It looks as though it's a parchment
designed to insult anyone...

885
01:14:00,199 --> 01:14:03,908
...who tries to read it.
I suspect it's a Zonko product.

886
01:14:04,079 --> 01:14:08,152
Nevertheless. I shall investigate
any hidden qualities it may possess.

887
01:14:08,319 --> 01:14:11,311
It is. after all. as you say.
my area of expertise.

888
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:14,677
Harry. would you come with me.
please? Professor. good night.

889
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:23,079
Are you deaf? Put that light out!

890
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:29,359
Come in.

891
01:14:31,079 --> 01:14:36,073
I haven't the faintest idea how this map
came to be in your possession...

892
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:40,551
...but quite frankly. I am astounded
that you didn't hand it in.

893
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:44,235
Did it never occur to you that this.
in the hands of Sirius Black...

894
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,311
...is a map to you?

895
01:14:47,119 --> 01:14:49,474
-No.
-No. sir.

896
01:14:51,399 --> 01:14:54,311
Your father never set much store
by the rules either.

897
01:14:54,479 --> 01:14:58,631
But he and your mother
gave their lives to save yours.

898
01:14:59,239 --> 01:15:03,152
Gambling their sacrifice
by wandering the castle unprotected...

899
01:15:03,319 --> 01:15:07,597
...with a killer on the loose
seems to me a poor way to repay them!

900
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:09,870
Now. I will not cover up for you again.

901
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:12,395
-Do you hear me?
-Yes. sir.

902
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:16,075
I want you to return to your dormitory
and stay there.

903
01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:20,790
And don't take any detours.
If you do. I shall know.

904
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:29,512
Professor. just so you know.
I don't think that map always works.

905
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:35,115
Earlier. it showed someone in the castle.
Someone I know to be dead.

906
01:15:35,519 --> 01:15:38,158
Oh. really? And who might that be?

907
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:39,799
Peter Pettigrew.

908
01:15:42,319 --> 01:15:44,310
That's not possible.

909
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:47,072
It's just what I saw.

910
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:51,438
Good night. professor.

911
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:58,793
Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.

912
01:15:58,959 --> 01:16:04,158
The art of crystal gazing
is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.

913
01:16:04,319 --> 01:16:07,516
Only then can you see. Try again.

914
01:16:08,039 --> 01:16:10,030
Now. what do we have here?

915
01:16:12,279 --> 01:16:14,395
Do you mind me trying?

916
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:19,553
The Grim. possibly.

917
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:25,553
My dear. from the first moment
you stepped foot in my class...

918
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:29,349
...I sensed that you did not possess
the proper spirit...

919
01:16:29,519 --> 01:16:33,273
...for the noble art of Divination.
No. you see. there.

920
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:36,955
You may be young in years.
but your heart is as shriveled...

921
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:40,954
...as an old maid's. your soul
as dry as the pages of the books...

922
01:16:41,119 --> 01:16:44,111
...to which you so desperately cleave.

923
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,911
Have I said something?

924
01:17:05,399 --> 01:17:10,189
She's gone mental. Hermione has.
Not that she wasn't always mental...

925
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:12,828
...but now it's in the open
for everyone to see.

926
01:17:12,999 --> 01:17:15,069
Hang on.

927
01:17:15,279 --> 01:17:18,032
-We better take this back.
-|'m not going back.

928
01:17:18,359 --> 01:17:21,635
-Fine. See you later.
-See you.

929
01:17:57,839 --> 01:18:02,913
Harry Potter. . . .

930
01:18:09,519 --> 01:18:13,592
-Professor Trelawney--
-He will return tonight.

931
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:15,318
Sorry?

932
01:18:15,519 --> 01:18:19,956
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends.
whose heart rots with murder...

933
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:22,076
...shall break free.

934
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:24,390
Innocent blood shall be spilt...

935
01:18:24,559 --> 01:18:30,316
...and servant and master
shall be reunited once more.

936
01:18:36,399 --> 01:18:39,516
I'm so sorry. dear boy.
Did you say something?

937
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:41,998
No.

938
01:18:42,440 --> 01:18:43,919
Nothing.

939
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:38,239
I can't believe they're going to kill
Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.

940
01:19:38,399 --> 01:19:41,038
-It just got worse.
-What did I say? Father said...

941
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:45,193
...I can keep the hippogriff's head.
I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.

942
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,715
This is going to be rich.

943
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:49,990
-Look who's here.
-Come to see the show?

944
01:19:50,159 --> 01:19:53,151
You! You foul. loathsome.
evil little cockroach!

945
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:54,992
Hermione. no!

946
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:57,710
He's not worth it.

947
01:20:11,239 --> 01:20:13,195
Malfoy. are you okay?

948
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:17,439
-Let's go. Ouick.
-Not a word to anyone. understood?

949
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:21,832
-That felt good.
-Not good. brilliant.

950
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:44,598
Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees
when the wind blows through them.

951
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:46,955
Why don't we just set him free?

952
01:20:47,119 --> 01:20:49,428
They'd know it was me.
and then Dumbledore...

953
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,478
...would get into trouble.
He's coming down. Dumbledore.

954
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:54,915
Says he wants to be with me
when they....

955
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:57,836
When it happens.

956
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,274
Great man. Dumbledore.

957
01:21:00,239 --> 01:21:01,718
A great man.

958
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:06,958
-We'l| stay with you too.
-You'll do no such thing!

959
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:10,157
Think I want you seeing
something like that? No.

960
01:21:10,319 --> 01:21:13,834
You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh. Before you do. Ron....

961
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:23,235
Scabbers! You're alive!

962
01:21:23,399 --> 01:21:26,948
-Keep a closer eye on your pet.
-I think you owe someone an apology.

963
01:21:27,119 --> 01:21:30,714
Right. Next time I see Crookshanks.
I'll let him know.

964
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:31,915
I meant me!

965
01:21:32,599 --> 01:21:34,715
Blimey. What was that?

966
01:21:40,919 --> 01:21:42,272
Hagrid!

967
01:21:44,119 --> 01:21:45,393
Oh. crikey.

968
01:21:46,799 --> 01:21:49,438
No. minister. Over this way.

969
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:53,553
It's late. It's nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.

970
01:21:53,719 --> 01:21:57,348
Someone sees you outside
this time of night. you'll be in trouble.

971
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:00,956
Particularly you. Harry.
With you in a moment!

972
01:22:02,319 --> 01:22:04,628
Ouick. Ouick!

973
01:22:04,799 --> 01:22:06,471
Hagrid.

974
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:10,394
-|t'|| be fine. It'll be okay.
-Go on. go on!

975
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:14,833
-That's ling you see over there--
-On the slope.

976
01:22:14,999 --> 01:22:17,559
-On the slope-- Ah. Hagrid.
-Professor Dumbledore.

977
01:22:17,719 --> 01:22:20,313
-Good evening.
-Minister. Make your way through.

978
01:22:20,519 --> 01:22:24,194
-Have a tea. if you like.
-No. Hagrid.

979
01:22:26,199 --> 01:22:28,667
-Gent|emen.
-|'d like a cup of tea.

980
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:32,077
Well. I think we should get down
to our business. shall we?

981
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:36,636
Very well. It is the decision
of the Committee for the Disposal...

982
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:39,837
...of Dangerous Creatures
that the hippogriff Buckbeak...

983
01:22:39,999 --> 01:22:45,278
...hereinafter called “the condemned."
shall be executed this day at sundown.

984
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:48,830
-Dear. dear....
-Now. now. Hagrid. Now. come on.

985
01:22:49,039 --> 01:22:53,237
-All right. It'll be all right.
-The execution shall dispatch--

986
01:22:53,399 --> 01:22:55,071
What?

987
01:22:55,239 --> 01:22:57,230
I thought I just saw--

988
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:59,436
-Never mind.
-Let's go!

989
01:23:04,319 --> 01:23:06,549
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.

990
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:52,559
Oh. no.

991
01:24:03,039 --> 01:24:05,155
He bit me. Scabbers.

992
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:07,597
Ron. Ron!

993
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:11,910
-Ron!
-Scabbers. come back.

994
01:24:13,359 --> 01:24:15,031
Wait!

995
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:24,838
-Scabbers. you bit me!
-Harry. you do realize what tree this is?

996
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,195
That's not good. Ron. run!

997
01:24:30,199 --> 01:24:32,633
Harry. Hermione. run!

998
01:24:33,199 --> 01:24:34,757
It's the Grim!

999
01:24:41,479 --> 01:24:44,391
-Harry!
-Ron! Ron. wait!

1000
01:24:44,599 --> 01:24:46,510
Harry!

1001
01:24:48,039 --> 01:24:50,314
-He|p!
-Ron!

1002
01:24:52,359 --> 01:24:55,476
-Ron. Ron.
-Ron!

1003
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:11,631
Come on!

1004
01:25:13,479 --> 01:25:14,832
Move!

1005
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:20,392
Duck!

1006
01:25:54,799 --> 01:25:56,994
Harry!

1007
01:26:12,239 --> 01:26:15,117
-Oh. I'm sorry.
-Don't worry.

1008
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:19,034
-Where do you suppose this goes?
-I have a hunch.

1009
01:26:19,559 --> 01:26:20,992
ljust hope I'm wrong.

1010
01:26:39,880 --> 01:26:42,917
We're in the Shrieking Shack.
aren't we?

1011
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:45,518
Come on.

1012
01:26:55,439 --> 01:26:56,792
Ron.

1013
01:26:57,319 --> 01:26:59,833
-Ron. You're okay.
-The dog. Where is it?

1014
01:27:00,039 --> 01:27:03,111
It's a trap. He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.

1015
01:27:16,439 --> 01:27:19,112
If you want to kill Harry.
you have to kill us too!

1016
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:20,998
No. Only one will die tonight.

1017
01:27:21,199 --> 01:27:23,030
Then it'll be you!

1018
01:27:28,999 --> 01:27:31,069
Are you going to kill me. Harry?

1019
01:27:32,239 --> 01:27:33,991
Exp elliarm us!

1020
01:27:37,559 --> 01:27:41,552
Well. well. Sirius.
Looking rather ragged. aren't we?

1021
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:44,672
Finally. the flesh
reflects the madness within.

1022
01:27:45,239 --> 01:27:48,709
Well. you'd know all about
the madness within. wouldn't you?

1023
01:27:58,720 --> 01:27:59,709
-I found him.
-I know.

1024
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:01,108
-|t's him.
-I understand.

1025
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:04,352
-Let's kill him!
-No! I trusted you!

1026
01:28:04,759 --> 01:28:08,354
And all this time.
you've been his friend.

1027
01:28:09,039 --> 01:28:11,951
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.

1028
01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:16,278
How long have you known?

1029
01:28:16,759 --> 01:28:19,831
-Since Professor Snape set the essay.
-We||. Hermione.

1030
01:28:20,039 --> 01:28:22,837
You are the brightest witch
of your age I've ever met.

1031
01:28:22,999 --> 01:28:25,308
Enough talk. Remus!
Come on. let's kill him!

1032
01:28:25,519 --> 01:28:28,033
-Wait!
-I did my waiting!

1033
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:30,509
Twelve years of it!

1034
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:33,395
In Azkaban!

1035
01:28:42,479 --> 01:28:44,151
Very well. Kill him.

1036
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:48,315
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.

1037
01:28:48,479 --> 01:28:49,992
I know why.

1038
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:52,350
You betrayed my parents.

1039
01:28:52,519 --> 01:28:55,317
-You're the reason they're dead!
-No. it wasn't him.

1040
01:28:55,479 --> 01:28:57,310
Somebody did betray your parents...

1041
01:28:57,479 --> 01:29:00,835
...somebody who. until quite recently.
I believed to be dead!

1042
01:29:01,039 --> 01:29:04,349
-Who was it. then?
-Peter Pettigrew!

1043
01:29:04,519 --> 01:29:07,511
And he's in this room! Right now!

1044
01:29:07,999 --> 01:29:10,832
Come out. come out. Peter!

1045
01:29:10,999 --> 01:29:13,877
-Come out. come out and play!
-Expelliarmusl

1046
01:29:16,720 --> 01:29:19,109
Vengeance is sweet.

1047
01:29:19,279 --> 01:29:21,429
How I hoped I'd be the one
to catch you.

1048
01:29:21,599 --> 01:29:22,873
Severus--

1049
01:29:23,039 --> 01:29:27,590
I told Dumbledore you were helping a
friend into the castle. Here's the proof.

1050
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:29,034
Brilliant. Snape.

1051
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:33,398
You've put your keen mind to the task
and come to the wrong conclusion.

1052
01:29:33,599 --> 01:29:36,159
If you'll excuse us.
Remus and I have business...

1053
01:29:36,319 --> 01:29:41,109
-...to attend to.
-Give me a reason. I beg you!

1054
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:43,748
-Don't be a fool.
-He can't help it. It's habit.

1055
01:29:43,959 --> 01:29:45,472
-Be quiet.
-Be quiet yourself!

1056
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:47,949
You two. quarrelling
like an old married couple.

1057
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:50,554
Run along and play with
your chemistry set!

1058
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:53,469
I could do it. you know.

1059
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:59,313
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.

1060
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:02,074
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh. yes.

1061
01:30:02,239 --> 01:30:05,595
A Dementor's Kiss. One can only
imagine what that must be like.

1062
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:10,959
It's said to be nearly unbearable
to witness. but I'll do my best.

1063
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:13,310
Severus. please.

1064
01:30:14,319 --> 01:30:16,230
After you.

1065
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:22,152
Exp elliarm us!

1066
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:27,276
-Harry! What did you just do?
-You attacked a teacher!

1067
01:30:27,479 --> 01:30:29,947
-Tell me about Peter.
-He was at school with us.

1068
01:30:30,119 --> 01:30:31,711
We thought he was our friend!

1069
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:34,758
-No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him!
-No. he didn't.

1070
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:37,992
I thought so too. until you mentioned
Pettigrew on the map!

1071
01:30:38,199 --> 01:30:40,872
-The map was lying. then.
-The map never lies!

1072
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:44,874
Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!

1073
01:30:45,319 --> 01:30:49,710
-Me?! He's mental!
-Not you! Your rat!

1074
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,992
-Scabbers has been in my family for--
-Twe|ve years?

1075
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:55,549
Curiously long life
for a common garden rat!

1076
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:58,188
-He's missing a toe. isn't he?
-So what?

1077
01:30:58,359 --> 01:31:01,192
-All they could find of Pettigrew was his--
-Finger!

1078
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:04,517
Dirty coward cut it off
so everyone would think he was dead!

1079
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:07,592
-And then he transformed into a rat!
-Show me.

1080
01:31:10,079 --> 01:31:13,037
-Give it to him. Ron.
-What are you trying to do to him?

1081
01:31:13,199 --> 01:31:14,234
Scabbers!

1082
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:17,358
Leave him alone! Get off him!
What are you doing?

1083
01:31:38,920 --> 01:31:40,672
Remus?

1084
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:42,833
Sirius.

1085
01:31:42,999 --> 01:31:44,830
My old friends!

1086
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:53,915
Harry! Look at you.
You look so much like your father.

1087
01:31:54,079 --> 01:31:57,594
-James. We were the best of friends--
-How dare you speak to Harry!

1088
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:00,914
How dare you talk about James
in front of him!

1089
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:06,114
-You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
-I didn't mean to!

1090
01:32:06,279 --> 01:32:08,998
The Dark Lord. You have no idea
the weapons he possesses!

1091
01:32:09,199 --> 01:32:11,713
Ask yourself. Sirius!
What would you have done?

1092
01:32:12,079 --> 01:32:17,437
-What would you have done?
-Died. rather than betray my friends!

1093
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:21,795
James wouldn't have wanted
me killed!

1094
01:32:21,999 --> 01:32:27,437
Your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!

1095
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:31,913
Should have realized if Voldemort
didn't kill you. we would. Together!

1096
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:34,076
No!

1097
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:39,308
-Harry. this man--
-I know what he is.

1098
01:32:39,479 --> 01:32:41,310
But we'll take him to the castle.

1099
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:46,315
-B|ess you. boy. Bless you!
-Get off!

1100
01:32:47,440 --> 01:32:49,715
I said we'd take you to the castle.

1101
01:32:50,079 --> 01:32:52,195
After that.
the dementors can have you.

1102
01:32:55,959 --> 01:32:59,554
Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.

1103
01:32:59,719 --> 01:33:03,109
A bit? A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!

1104
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:04,759
I was going for the rat.

1105
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:08,595
Normally. I have a very sweet
disposition as a dog.

1106
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:13,788
More than once. James suggested
that I make the change permanent.

1107
01:33:13,959 --> 01:33:18,635
The tail I could live with.
But the fleas. they're murder.

1108
01:33:30,679 --> 01:33:32,112
Okay.

1109
01:33:36,919 --> 01:33:39,353
-You better go.
-No. Don't worry. okay?

1110
01:33:39,519 --> 01:33:40,872
It's fine. I'll stay.

1111
01:33:41,599 --> 01:33:43,510
You go. I'll stay.

1112
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:46,792
-You okay?
-|'m fine. Go.

1113
01:33:48,319 --> 01:33:51,197
-That looks really painful.
-So painful.

1114
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:53,828
They might chop it.

1115
01:33:54,280 --> 01:33:56,840
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey
will fix it in a heartbeat.

1116
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:01,039
It's too late. It's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.

1117
01:34:02,239 --> 01:34:03,991
It's beautiful. isn't it?

1118
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:08,395
I'll never forget the first time
I walked through those doors.

1119
01:34:09,079 --> 01:34:12,116
It'll be nice to do it again
as a free man.

1120
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:16,879
That was a noble thing
you did back there.

1121
01:34:17,640 --> 01:34:19,710
He doesn't deserve it.

1122
01:34:19,879 --> 01:34:22,916
I didn't think my dad
would have wanted his best friends...

1123
01:34:23,079 --> 01:34:24,558
...to become killers.

1124
01:34:24,719 --> 01:34:28,268
Besides. dead.
the truth dies with him.

1125
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:30,715
Alive. you're free.

1126
01:34:30,879 --> 01:34:33,837
Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!

1127
01:34:34,039 --> 01:34:37,236
Ron! Haven't I been a good pet?
You won't let them give me...

1128
01:34:37,399 --> 01:34:39,788
...to the dementors. will you?
I was your rat!

1129
01:34:39,959 --> 01:34:43,838
-Sweet. clever girl! Surely you won't--
-Get away from her!

1130
01:34:46,199 --> 01:34:48,030
I don't know if you know. Harry...

1131
01:34:48,199 --> 01:34:52,112
...but when you were born. James
and Lily made me your godfather.

1132
01:34:52,279 --> 01:34:54,156
I know.

1133
01:34:55,279 --> 01:34:59,158
I can understand if you choose
to stay with your aunt and uncle...

1134
01:34:59,319 --> 01:35:01,708
...but if you ever wanted
a different home....

1135
01:35:01,879 --> 01:35:04,268
What? Come and live with you?

1136
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:08,557
It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.

1137
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:10,239
Harry!

1138
01:35:25,039 --> 01:35:28,554
Remus. my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?

1139
01:35:29,839 --> 01:35:34,959
You know the man you truly are. Remus!
This heart is where you truly live! Here!

1140
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:38,151
This flesh is only flesh!

1141
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:41,271
Exp elliarm us!

1142
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:52,439
Harry!

1143
01:35:53,479 --> 01:35:56,312
Remus! Remus!

1144
01:36:02,280 --> 01:36:04,510
Run! Run!

1145
01:36:14,119 --> 01:36:16,075
-Come on.
-Wait. Wait.

1146
01:36:16,239 --> 01:36:21,108
Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea.

1147
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:23,430
Professor?

1148
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:28,839
Professor Lupin?

1149
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:39,397
Nice doggy. Nice doggy!

1150
01:36:39,799 --> 01:36:42,233
There you are. Potter!

1151
01:37:14,640 --> 01:37:15,629
Sirius!

1152
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:18,749
Come back here. Potter!

1153
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:23,233
Sirius!

1154
01:38:23,999 --> 01:38:26,832
No. Sirius!

1155
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,753
Expecto Patronuml

1156
01:41:17,120 --> 01:41:19,395
Harry?

1157
01:41:20,280 --> 01:41:22,555
I saw my dad.

1158
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:24,239
What?

1159
01:41:24,439 --> 01:41:25,918
He sent the dementors away.

1160
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:27,433
I saw him across the lake.

1161
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:29,192
Harry. they've captured Sirius.

1162
01:41:29,399 --> 01:41:32,118
Any minute the dementors
are gonna perform the Kiss.

1163
01:41:32,280 --> 01:41:34,669
-They're gonna kill him?
-No. It's worse.

1164
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:36,632
Much worse.

1165
01:41:36,799 --> 01:41:39,074
They're going to suck out his soul.

1166
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:42,039
Headmaster. stop them.

1167
01:41:42,199 --> 01:41:45,430
-They've got the wrong man.
-|t's true. Sirius is innocent.

1168
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:47,716
-|t's Scabbers who did it.
-Scabbers?

1169
01:41:47,879 --> 01:41:49,198
He's my rat. sir.

1170
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:53,229
He's not really a rat. He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.

1171
01:41:53,439 --> 01:41:56,954
-But then they gave him an owl--
-The point is. we know the truth.

1172
01:41:57,159 --> 01:41:59,548
-Please believe us.
-I do. Miss Granger.

1173
01:41:59,759 --> 01:42:04,958
But the word of three 13-year-old
wizards will convince few others.

1174
01:42:07,919 --> 01:42:10,592
A child's voice.
however honest and true...

1175
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:14,355
...is meaningless to those
who have forgotten how to listen.

1176
01:42:19,360 --> 01:42:21,794
Mysterious thing. time.

1177
01:42:22,919 --> 01:42:24,193
Powerful...

1178
01:42:24,359 --> 01:42:27,112
...and when meddled with.
dangerous.

1179
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:32,110
Sirius Black is in the topmost
cell of the Dark Tower.

1180
01:42:32,879 --> 01:42:34,915
You know the laws. Miss Granger.

1181
01:42:35,080 --> 01:42:36,798
You must not be seen.

1182
01:42:36,959 --> 01:42:40,474
And you would do well. I feel.
to return before this last chime.

1183
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:44,030
If not. the consequences
are too ghastly to discuss.

1184
01:42:44,559 --> 01:42:46,277
If you succeed tonight...

1185
01:42:46,439 --> 01:42:49,158
...more than one innocent life
may be spared.

1186
01:42:50,919 --> 01:42:53,035
Three turns should do it. I think.

1187
01:42:57,719 --> 01:42:59,471
Oh. and by the way.

1188
01:42:59,639 --> 01:43:05,236
When in doubt. I find retracing
my steps to be a wise place to begin.

1189
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:07,391
Good luck.

1190
01:43:07,880 --> 01:43:10,235
What the bloody hell
was that all about?

1191
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:13,110
Sorry. Ron. but seeing
as you can't walk....

1192
01:43:40,919 --> 01:43:42,477
What just happened?

1193
01:43:42,640 --> 01:43:44,835
-Where's Ron?
-7:30.

1194
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:46,797
Where were we at 7:30?

1195
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:48,678
I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?

1196
01:43:48,839 --> 01:43:51,114
Come on. And we can't be seen.

1197
01:43:52,159 --> 01:43:53,911
Hermione!

1198
01:44:11,359 --> 01:44:13,919
Hermione! Hermione. wait.

1199
01:44:15,640 --> 01:44:19,076
Hermione. will you please tell me
what it is we're doing?

1200
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:21,999
You foul. loathsome.
evil little cockroach!

1201
01:44:22,159 --> 01:44:23,433
That's us.

1202
01:44:23,639 --> 01:44:26,437
Hermione. no! He's not worth it.

1203
01:44:26,639 --> 01:44:28,038
This is not normal.

1204
01:44:30,239 --> 01:44:32,514
This is a Time-Turner. Harry.

1205
01:44:32,679 --> 01:44:34,795
McGonagall gave it to me first term.

1206
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:38,157
This is how I've been getting
to my lessons all year.

1207
01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:41,432
-You mean we've gone back in time?
-Yes.

1208
01:44:41,599 --> 01:44:44,830
Dumbledore obviously wanted us
to return to this moment.

1209
01:44:47,039 --> 01:44:50,076
Clearly. something happened
he wants us to change.

1210
01:44:53,080 --> 01:44:54,354
Good punch.

1211
01:44:54,520 --> 01:44:55,953
Thanks.

1212
01:44:56,919 --> 01:44:58,511
Malfoy's coming.

1213
01:44:59,399 --> 01:45:01,629
-Run.
-Not a word to anyone. understood?

1214
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:05,038
I'm gonna get that jumped-up
mudblood! Mark my words.

1215
01:45:05,200 --> 01:45:08,954
-That felt good.
-Not good. brilliant.

1216
01:45:10,280 --> 01:45:12,748
Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.

1217
01:45:31,120 --> 01:45:33,554
Look. Buckbeak's still alive.

1218
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:36,757
Of course.

1219
01:45:36,919 --> 01:45:38,830
Remember what Dumbledore said?

1220
01:45:38,999 --> 01:45:42,878
If we succeed. more than one
innocent life could be spared.

1221
01:45:43,240 --> 01:45:44,514
Let's go.

1222
01:46:04,919 --> 01:46:06,955
Here they come. I'd better hurry.

1223
01:46:07,120 --> 01:46:09,509
Fudge has to see Buckbeak
before we steal him.

1224
01:46:09,679 --> 01:46:12,034
Otherwise. he'll think Hagrid
set him free.

1225
01:46:13,039 --> 01:46:15,314
Scabbers. you're alive!

1226
01:46:15,480 --> 01:46:18,153
-Keep a closer eye on your pet.
-That's Pettigrew.

1227
01:46:18,359 --> 01:46:21,157
-Harry. you can't.
-He betrayed my parents.

1228
01:46:21,319 --> 01:46:24,197
-You don't expect me to sit here.
-Yes. and you must!

1229
01:46:27,919 --> 01:46:30,513
Harry. you're in Hagrid's hut now.

1230
01:46:30,679 --> 01:46:33,398
If you go bursting in.
you'll think you've gone mad.

1231
01:46:33,559 --> 01:46:36,312
Awful things happen to wizards
who meddle with time.

1232
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:38,630
We can't be seen.

1233
01:46:41,799 --> 01:46:43,437
Fudge is coming.

1234
01:46:44,319 --> 01:46:46,310
And we aren't leaving?

1235
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:49,913
Why aren't we leaving?

1236
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:01,879
Are you mad?

1237
01:47:07,639 --> 01:47:08,958
That hurt.

1238
01:47:09,160 --> 01:47:10,434
Sorry.

1239
01:47:30,439 --> 01:47:32,999
We're coming out the back door. Go!

1240
01:47:49,680 --> 01:47:52,399
Is that really what my hair
looks like from the back?

1241
01:47:54,359 --> 01:47:55,633
What?

1242
01:47:56,479 --> 01:47:58,231
I thought I just saw....

1243
01:47:58,439 --> 01:48:00,999
-Never mind.
-Let's go.

1244
01:48:14,719 --> 01:48:16,914
Okay. go. Harry. Go!

1245
01:48:22,919 --> 01:48:24,796
Get away. Get off.

1246
01:48:46,079 --> 01:48:49,355
Minister. I really think
I should sign as well.

1247
01:48:50,159 --> 01:48:53,196
Yes. very well. Perhaps it would be....

1248
01:48:53,399 --> 01:48:57,028
Okay. Buckbeak. Come quickly.
Come with us now. Come on.

1249
01:49:01,319 --> 01:49:03,913
Keep trying. Come on. Ouickly.

1250
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:09,829
Buckbeak. Okay?
Ouickly. Hurry up. Okay?

1251
01:49:10,639 --> 01:49:13,790
-Your name only.
-|t's such a very long name....

1252
01:49:14,159 --> 01:49:15,797
Hurry up now. Buckbeak. okay?

1253
01:49:18,400 --> 01:49:21,233
Come on.
Come on. Buckbeak.

1254
01:49:21,439 --> 01:49:23,634
Come and get the nice dead ferret.

1255
01:49:26,159 --> 01:49:30,471
-Come on. It's here. Come on. Beaky.
-Here we are. minister. Follow me.

1256
01:49:30,679 --> 01:49:32,271
-Now. look there.
-Where?

1257
01:49:32,479 --> 01:49:35,710
-Look beyond the rocks.
-What am I supposed to see?

1258
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:39,236
Professor Dippet had that ling
planted when he was headmaster.

1259
01:49:39,400 --> 01:49:42,119
-Oh. yes. Indeed. indeed.
-And all the strawberries.

1260
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:45,793
-Come on. Buckbeak. Come on.
-| see no strawberries.

1261
01:49:45,959 --> 01:49:47,074
-Over there.
-Where?

1262
01:49:47,239 --> 01:49:48,911
-Over there.
-This way.

1263
01:49:49,119 --> 01:49:51,679
-Let's get this over. please.
-All right.

1264
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:54,918
But where is it?

1265
01:49:55,800 --> 01:49:57,916
I saw the beast. just now.

1266
01:49:58,519 --> 01:50:00,635
-Not a moment ago!
-How extraordinary.

1267
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:02,074
Buckbeak.

1268
01:50:02,279 --> 01:50:06,192
Come now. Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.

1269
01:50:06,359 --> 01:50:07,633
-Hagrid?
-Buckbeak.

1270
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:11,913
I don't think the minister's suggesting
you had anything to do with this.

1271
01:50:12,119 --> 01:50:14,838
How could you?
You've been with us all the time.

1272
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:16,797
-Right.
-Well. well.

1273
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:18,439
We must search the grounds.

1274
01:50:18,599 --> 01:50:21,511
Well. search the skies.
if you must. minister.

1275
01:50:21,679 --> 01:50:26,878
Meanwhile. I'd like a nice cup
of tea or a large brandy.

1276
01:50:27,040 --> 01:50:30,874
Oh. executioner. your services
are no longer required.

1277
01:50:31,039 --> 01:50:32,836
Thank you.

1278
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:36,191
You'll find no small glasses
in this house. professor.

1279
01:50:46,519 --> 01:50:47,952
-Come on.
-This way.

1280
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:56,198
This way. now.

1281
01:50:58,519 --> 01:51:00,191
-Now what?
-We save Sirius.

1282
01:51:00,399 --> 01:51:02,788
-How?
-No idea.

1283
01:51:11,719 --> 01:51:13,994
-Look. It's Lupin.
-Immohulusl

1284
01:51:20,160 --> 01:51:22,071
And Snape's coming.

1285
01:51:28,040 --> 01:51:29,632
And now we wait.

1286
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:32,518
And now we wait.

1287
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:02,077
-At least someone's enjoying himself.
-Yeah.

1288
01:52:04,760 --> 01:52:06,478
-Hermione?
-Yeah?

1289
01:52:06,639 --> 01:52:10,791
Before. down by the lake.
when I was with Sirius...

1290
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:12,996
...I did see someone.

1291
01:52:13,159 --> 01:52:16,435
That someone
made the dementors go away.

1292
01:52:16,599 --> 01:52:17,873
With a Patronus.

1293
01:52:18,039 --> 01:52:19,870
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.

1294
01:52:20,040 --> 01:52:21,439
According to him...

1295
01:52:21,599 --> 01:52:24,875
...only a really powerful wizard
could have conjured it.

1296
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:26,837
It was my dad.

1297
01:52:27,919 --> 01:52:29,637
My dad conjured the Patronus.

1298
01:52:29,799 --> 01:52:31,949
-Harry. but your dad's--
-Dead. I know.

1299
01:52:33,319 --> 01:52:35,549
I'm just telling you what I saw.

1300
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:41,078
Here we come.

1301
01:52:46,519 --> 01:52:48,794
You see Sirius talking to me there?

1302
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:51,679
-He's asking me to come live with him.
-That's great.

1303
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:55,037
When we free him. I'll never
have to go back to the Dursleys'.

1304
01:52:55,199 --> 01:52:56,757
It'll just be me and him.

1305
01:52:57,399 --> 01:52:59,276
We could live in the country...

1306
01:52:59,439 --> 01:53:01,953
...someplace you can see the sky.

1307
01:53:02,119 --> 01:53:04,838
He'll like that after
all those years in Azkaban.

1308
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:07,319
Harry!

1309
01:53:08,799 --> 01:53:10,437
Run!

1310
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:18,519
Let's go.

1311
01:53:37,279 --> 01:53:39,509
-What are you doing?
-Saving your life.

1312
01:53:43,599 --> 01:53:44,918
Thanks.

1313
01:53:46,680 --> 01:53:50,559
-Great. Now he's coming for us.
-Yeah. I didn't think about that. Run!

1314
01:55:02,599 --> 01:55:04,271
That was so scary.

1315
01:55:04,439 --> 01:55:07,272
Poor Professor Lupin's
having a really tough night.

1316
01:55:18,240 --> 01:55:21,232
Sirius. Come on!

1317
01:55:36,599 --> 01:55:38,635
-This is horrible.
-Don't worry.

1318
01:55:38,799 --> 01:55:41,871
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.

1319
01:55:50,240 --> 01:55:51,992
Any minute now.

1320
01:55:52,200 --> 01:55:54,156
Right there. You'll see.

1321
01:55:55,480 --> 01:55:57,869
Harry. listen to me.
No one's coming.

1322
01:55:58,040 --> 01:56:00,474
Don't worry. he will.
He will come.

1323
01:56:04,440 --> 01:56:06,795
-Sirius.
-You're dying...

1324
01:56:08,759 --> 01:56:10,556
...both of you.

1325
01:56:12,560 --> 01:56:14,198
Harry!

1326
01:56:16,040 --> 01:56:19,749
Expecto Patronuml

1327
01:57:15,959 --> 01:57:17,472
You were right. Hermione.

1328
01:57:17,639 --> 01:57:20,836
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!

1329
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,639
I saw myself conjuring
the Patronus before.

1330
01:57:23,799 --> 01:57:26,074
I knew I could do it
this time because...

1331
01:57:26,240 --> 01:57:27,878
...well. I had already done it.

1332
01:57:28,040 --> 01:57:30,395
-Does that make sense?
-No.

1333
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:33,279
But I don't like flying...!

1334
01:57:45,879 --> 01:57:47,153
Bombardal

1335
01:58:19,119 --> 01:58:21,792
I'll be forever grateful for this...

1336
01:58:21,959 --> 01:58:23,233
...to both of you.

1337
01:58:23,399 --> 01:58:26,197
-I want to go with you.
-One day. perhaps.

1338
01:58:26,359 --> 01:58:29,157
For some time. my life
will be too unpredictable.

1339
01:58:29,320 --> 01:58:30,992
And besides...

1340
01:58:31,880 --> 01:58:35,031
-...you're meant to be here.
-But you're innocent.

1341
01:58:35,199 --> 01:58:37,235
And you know it.

1342
01:58:38,280 --> 01:58:40,077
And for now. that will do.

1343
01:58:42,320 --> 01:58:44,754
I expect you're tired of hearing this...

1344
01:58:45,719 --> 01:58:48,153
...but you look so like your father.

1345
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:51,717
Except your eyes.

1346
01:58:52,640 --> 01:58:54,835
-You have--
-My mother's eyes.

1347
01:58:56,719 --> 01:59:01,588
It's cruel that I spent so much time
with James and Lily. and you so little.

1348
01:59:02,159 --> 01:59:03,592
But know this:

1349
01:59:04,680 --> 01:59:07,717
The ones that love us
never really leave us.

1350
01:59:09,039 --> 01:59:10,916
And you can always find them...

1351
01:59:13,199 --> 01:59:14,996
...in here.

1352
01:59:24,959 --> 01:59:27,393
You really are the brightest
witch of your age.

1353
01:59:53,119 --> 01:59:54,677
We have to go.

1354
02:00:21,800 --> 02:00:24,360
-We||?
-He's free. We did it.

1355
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:25,999
Did what?

1356
02:00:26,159 --> 02:00:28,036
Good night.

1357
02:00:36,440 --> 02:00:37,714
How did you get there?

1358
02:00:37,880 --> 02:00:40,440
I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.

1359
02:00:40,760 --> 02:00:43,274
-What's he talking about. Harry?
-I don't know.

1360
02:00:43,440 --> 02:00:46,830
Honestly. Ron. How can somebody
be in two places at once?

1361
02:01:12,239 --> 02:01:13,672
Hello. Harry.

1362
02:01:17,159 --> 02:01:18,911
I saw you coming.

1363
02:01:23,279 --> 02:01:25,873
I've looked worse. believe me.

1364
02:01:28,480 --> 02:01:31,517
-You've been sacked.
-No.

1365
02:01:31,679 --> 02:01:34,512
No. I resigned. actually.

1366
02:01:34,679 --> 02:01:36,397
Resigned? Why?

1367
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:41,634
Well. it seems that somebody
let slip the nature of my condition.

1368
02:01:41,800 --> 02:01:47,079
This time tomorrow. the owls will start
arriving and parents will not want...

1369
02:01:47,239 --> 02:01:50,470
...well. someone like me
teaching their children.

1370
02:01:50,680 --> 02:01:52,511
-But Dumbledore--
-He has already...

1371
02:01:52,679 --> 02:01:54,476
...risked enough on my behalf.

1372
02:01:54,639 --> 02:01:57,756
Besides. people like me are....

1373
02:01:58,359 --> 02:02:01,556
Well. let's just say
that I'm used to it by now.

1374
02:02:10,719 --> 02:02:13,187
Why do you look so miserable. Harry?

1375
02:02:13,359 --> 02:02:15,429
None of it made any difference.

1376
02:02:15,599 --> 02:02:18,989
-Pettigrew escaped.
-Didn't make any difference?

1377
02:02:19,160 --> 02:02:22,516
It made all the difference in the world.
You uncovered the truth.

1378
02:02:22,679 --> 02:02:25,068
You saved an innocent man
from a terrible fate.

1379
02:02:25,440 --> 02:02:27,829
It made a great deal of difference.

1380
02:02:32,279 --> 02:02:34,395
If I am proud of anything...

1381
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:37,120
...it is of how much
you have learned this year.

1382
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:39,919
Now. since I am no longer
your teacher...

1383
02:02:40,080 --> 02:02:44,153
...I feel no guilt whatsoever
about giving this back to you.

1384
02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:47,429
So now I'll say goodbye. Harry.

1385
02:02:47,600 --> 02:02:50,068
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.

1386
02:02:50,599 --> 02:02:51,873
Until then...

1387
02:02:53,160 --> 02:02:54,798
...mischief managed.

1388
02:03:27,639 --> 02:03:31,678
Stand back. I said! Or I'll take it
upstairs if you don't settle.

1389
02:03:31,840 --> 02:03:33,193
Harry.

1390
02:03:33,999 --> 02:03:35,318
Wherever did you get it?

1391
02:03:35,479 --> 02:03:37,788
Can I have a go. Harry?
After you. of course.

1392
02:03:37,959 --> 02:03:40,029
-What are you talking about?
-Ouiet.

1393
02:03:40,199 --> 02:03:43,350
Let the man through.
I didn't mean to open it. Harry.

1394
02:03:43,520 --> 02:03:45,909
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.

1395
02:03:46,080 --> 02:03:47,513
Did not.

1396
02:03:48,840 --> 02:03:52,196
-|t's a Firebolt.
-|t's the fastest broom in the world.

1397
02:03:52,359 --> 02:03:53,838
For me?

1398
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,434
-But who sent it?
-No one knows.

1399
02:03:56,599 --> 02:03:58,430
This came with it.

1400
02:04:03,080 --> 02:04:04,672
-Go on. Harry!
-Yeah. let's see.

1401
02:04:04,839 --> 02:04:06,591
How fast is it. Harry?

1402
02:04:25,160 --> 02:04:26,718
Lumos.

1403
02:04:26,880 --> 02:04:29,189
I solemnly swear that I am
up to no good.

1404
02:15:20,559 --> 02:15:22,277
Mischief managed.

1405
02:15:27,799 --> 02:15:29,198
Nox.
