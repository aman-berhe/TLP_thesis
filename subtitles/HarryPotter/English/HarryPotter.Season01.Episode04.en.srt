1
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,069
Bloody kids.

2
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,155
How fastidious you've become.
Wormtail.

3
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,518
As I recall. you once called
the nearest gutter pipe home.

4
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,674
Could it be that the task of nursing me
has become wearisome for you?

5
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,195
Oh. no. No. no. my Lord Voldemort.

6
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,594
| only meant...

7
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,593
...perhaps if we were to do it
without the boy.

8
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,035
No! The boy is everything!

9
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,590
It cannot be done without him.
And it will be done.

10
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,320
Exactly as I said.

11
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,275
-I will not disappoint you. my Lord.
-Good.

12
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:05,351
First. gather our old comrades.

13
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,670
Send them a sign.

14
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:22,275
Nagini tells me
the old Muggle caretaker...

15
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,955
...is standing just outside the door.

16
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,240
Step aside. Wormtail.
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.

17
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,152
Avada Kedavra!

18
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:39,392
Harry.

19
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,712
Harry!

20
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,678
Are you all right?

21
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,396
Hermione. Bad dream.

22
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:50,756
-When did you get here?
-Just now. You?

23
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:52,113
Last night.

24
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:54,429
Wake up! Wake up. Ronald!

25
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,794
Bloody hell.

26
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:57,392
Honestly. get dressed.

27
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,792
And don't go back to sleep.

28
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:03,156
Come on. Ron!
Your mother says breakfast's ready!

29
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:12,278
-Ron. where are we actually going?
-Don't know.

30
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,871
-Hey. Dad. Where are we going?
-Haven't the foggiest.

31
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:17,472
Keep up!

32
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,712
Arthur!

33
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,791
It's about time. son.

34
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:28,157
Sorry. Amos. Some of us
had a bit of a sleepy start.

35
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,758
This is Amos Diggory. everyone.
Works with me at the Ministry.

36
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,349
And this strapping young lad
must be Cedric. am I right?

37
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:37,634
Yes. sir.

38
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,392
This way.

39
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:44,270
Merlin's beard!
You must be Harry Potter.

40
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,079
-Yes. sir.
-Great. great pleasure.

41
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,958
Pleasure to meet you too. sir.

42
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:54,039
Yes. it's just over there.

43
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:57,951
-Shall we?
-Oh. yeah.

44
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,235
We don't want to be late.

45
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,393
Come on. Nearly there now.
Get yourself into a good position.

46
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,590
Why are they all standing around
that manky old boot?

47
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:09,148
-That isn't just any manky old boot.
-|t's a Portkey.

48
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,593
Time to go!

49
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:12,317
What's a Portkey?

50
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,358
-Ready! After three. One. two...
-Harry!

51
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,555
...three!

52
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,229
Let go. kids!

53
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,868
-What?!
-Let go!

54
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,908
I'll bet that cleared your sinuses. eh?

55
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,309
-Tota| shambles. as per usual.
-Thanks.

56
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:56,915
Go on. look at that!

57
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,472
Well. kids. welcome to
the Ouidditch World Cup!

58
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,920
Stay together! Keep up. girls!

59
00:06:08,359 --> 00:06:09,587
Look!

60
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,635
Come on! Keep up. girls!

61
00:06:19,239 --> 00:06:20,592
Blimey!

62
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,557
Parting of the ways. I think. old chap.

63
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,038
-See you at the match.
-See you.

64
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,474
-Cedric.
-Ced. come on.

65
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:27,231
See you later. Cedric.

66
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,670
Home sweet home.

67
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,879
What?

68
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,797
-Excellent. excellent.
-Ginny. look!

69
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,233
-All to the bath.
-Look.

70
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,789
Girls. choose a bunk and unpack.

71
00:06:50,359 --> 00:06:52,668
Ron. get out of the kitchen.
We're all hungry.

72
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,229
-Yeah. get out of the kitchen. Ron!
-Feet off the table!

73
00:06:55,399 --> 00:06:57,594
-Feet off the table!
-Feet off the table!

74
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,830
I love magic.

75
00:07:15,559 --> 00:07:18,790
Get your Ouidditch World Cup
programs here!

76
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:22,116
Blimey. Dad. How far up are we?

77
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:23,632
Well. put it this way:

78
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,518
If it rains...

79
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:27,909
...you'll be the first to know.

80
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:30,954
Father and l are in
the minister's box...

81
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:34,270
...by personal invitation
of Cornelius Fudge himself.

82
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:36,509
Don't boast. Draco.

83
00:07:36,679 --> 00:07:38,715
There's no need with these people.

84
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:43,468
Do enjoy yourself. won't you?

85
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,632
While you can.

86
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,950
Come on up. Take your seats. I told you
these seats would be worth waiting for.

87
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:04,916
Come on!

88
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,956
It's the Irish! There's Troy!

89
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:10,871
-And Mullet!
-And Moran!

90
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,072
Ireland! Ireland! Ireland!

91
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,232
-Here come the Bulgarians!
-Yes!

92
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,359
Who's that?

93
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,998
That. sis. is the best Seeker
in the world.

94
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,350
Krum! Krum! Krum!

95
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:48,068
Krum!

96
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,912
Yes!

97
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,151
Good evening!

98
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,558
As Minister for Magic...

99
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:05,671
...it gives me great pleasure...

100
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,875
...to welcome
each and every one of you...

101
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:15,672
...to the final
of the 422nd Ouidditch World Cup!

102
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,599
Let the match...

103
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,473
...begin!

104
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,430
Krum! Krum! Krum!

105
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,551
There's no one like Krum.

106
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,278
-Krum?
-Dumb Krum?

107
00:09:38,439 --> 00:09:41,351
He's like a bird.
the way he rides the wind.

108
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,318
-He's more than an athlete.
-Dumb Krum.

109
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,799
He's an artist.

110
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,030
-I think you're in love. Ron.
-Shut up.

111
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,639
Viktur, I love you

112
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,358
Vilr tar, I do

113
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,591
When we 're apart
My heart beats only far you

114
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:57,319
Sounds like the Irish
have got their pride on.

115
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,152
Stop! Stop it!

116
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,193
It's not the Irish.

117
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,350
We've gotta get out of here. Now!

118
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,675
Get out. it's the Death Eaters!

119
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:12,036
Get back to the Portkey. everybody.
and stick together!

120
00:10:12,199 --> 00:10:14,759
Fred. George!
Ginny is your responsibility.

121
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,997
Go!

122
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,912
Harry!

123
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,190
-Keep up. you lot!
-Harry!

124
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,436
Harry! Harry!

125
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:25,592
Mursrnurdre!

126
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,673
Harry!

127
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,192
-Where are you?
-Harry!

128
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,914
We've been looking for you for ages!

129
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:03,711
Thought we lost you. mate.

130
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,431
What is that?

131
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,391
Slupely!

132
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,834
Stop!

133
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,116
That's my son!

134
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,680
-Ron. Harry. Hermione. you all right?
-We came back for Harry.

135
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,068
Which of you conjured it?

136
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,356
-Crouch. you can't possi--
-Do not lie!

137
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,397
You've been discovered
at the scene of the crime.

138
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,516
-Crime?
-Barty! They're just kids.

139
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,113
What crime?

140
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,669
It's the Dark Mark. Harry.
It's his mark.

141
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,955
What. Voldemort?

142
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:36,788
Those people tonight. in the masks.
they're his too. aren't they?

143
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,076
-His followers?
-Yeah.

144
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,076
Death Eaters.

145
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,634
-Fo||ow me.
-There was a man. before.

146
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,394
There!

147
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,790
All of you. this way!

148
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,879
A man. Harry?

149
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,559
Who?

150
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:55,677
I don't know.

151
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,356
I didn't see his face.

152
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,912
Anything from the trolley?

153
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:21,871
Anything from the trolley?

154
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,311
Anything from the trolley. dears?

155
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:29,595
Packet of Drooble's...

156
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,478
...and a Licorice Wand.

157
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,870
On second thought. just the Drooble's.

158
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:38,873
-|t's all right. I'll get it. Don't worry.
-Just the Drooble's. Thanks.

159
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,388
Two Pumpkin Pasties. please.

160
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,118
Thank you.

161
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:51,835
Anything sweet for you. dear?

162
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,869
Oh. no. I'm not hungry. Thank you.

163
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:57,670
Anything from the trolley?

164
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,795
This is horrible.

165
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,754
How can the Ministry
not know who conjured it?

166
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,632
Wasn't there any security or...?

167
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,472
Loads. according to Dad.

168
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:11,427
That's what worried them so much.
Happened right under their noses.

169
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:17,235
lt's hurting again. isn't it?
Your scar.

170
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,991
I'm fine.

171
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,713
You know Sirius will
want to hear about this...

172
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:27,713
...what you saw at the World Cup
and the dream.

173
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,872
Hedwig. There we go.

174
00:15:16,439 --> 00:15:18,634
Clear the runway!

175
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,479
Well. there's something
you don't see every day.

176
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:54,190
Well, now we 're all settled in and sorted,
I'd like to make an announcement.

177
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,436
This castle will not only be
your home this year...

178
00:15:58,599 --> 00:16:01,636
...but home to some
very special guests as well.

179
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:04,427
You see. Hogwarts has been chosen....

180
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,832
Yes. what is it?

181
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,359
What is it?

182
00:16:10,599 --> 00:16:13,796
Tell them to wait.
Tell them to wait. Wait.

183
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:19,670
So Hogwarts has been chosen
to host a legendary event:

184
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,795
The Triwizard Tournament.

185
00:16:22,319 --> 00:16:24,310
-For those of you who do not know...
-Bri|liant.

186
00:16:24,479 --> 00:16:27,516
...the Triwizard Tournament
brings together three schools...

187
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,716
...for a series of magical contests.

188
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:33,189
From each school. a single student
is selected to compete.

189
00:16:33,439 --> 00:16:35,077
Now let me be clear.

190
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,038
lf chosen. you stand alone.

191
00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:40,030
And trust me when I say...

192
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:43,077
...these contests are not
for the faint-hearted.

193
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,512
But more of that later.
For now. please join me in welcoming...

194
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,559
...the lovely ladies of the
Beauxbatons Academy of Magic...

195
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:55,507
...and their headmistress.
Madame Maxime.

196
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,039
Bloody hell.

197
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,830
Blimey. That's one big woman.

198
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,951
And now our friends from the north.

199
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:44,838
Please greet the proud sons
of Durmstrang...

200
00:17:44,999 --> 00:17:47,672
...and their high master.
lgor Karkaroff.

201
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:11,312
Oh. it's Krum!

202
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,879
Blimey. it's him!

203
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,836
Viktor Krum!

204
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,753
Albus.

205
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:26,557
lgor.

206
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,155
Professor Dumbly-dorr.
my horses have traveled a long way.

207
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,754
-They will need attending to.
-Don't worry. Madame Maxime.

208
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,310
Our gamekeeper. Hagrid.
is more than capable of seeing to them.

209
00:18:49,479 --> 00:18:51,629
But you know. Monsieur Hagrid...

210
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,315
...they drink only single-malt whiskey.

211
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,952
You idiot!

212
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,671
Your attention. please!

213
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:12,995
I'd like to say a few words.

214
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:16,635
Eternal glory.

215
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:20,958
That is what awaits the student
who wins the Triwizard Tournament.

216
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,159
But to do this. that student
must survive three tasks.

217
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,029
Three extremely dangerous tasks.

218
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,555
-Wicked.
-Wicked.

219
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,713
For this reason. the Ministry has seen fit
to impose a new rule.

220
00:19:34,879 --> 00:19:36,198
To explain all this...

221
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,830
...we have the head of the Department
of International Magical Cooperation...

222
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,036
...Mr. Bartemius Crouch.

223
00:19:55,879 --> 00:19:58,473
Bloody hell. lt's Mad-Eye Moody.

224
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:02,311
-A|astor Moody? The Auror?
-Auror?

225
00:20:02,479 --> 00:20:05,789
Dark-wizard catcher. Half the cells
in Azkaban are filled thanks to him.

226
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,472
He's supposed to be mad as a hatter.
though. these days.

227
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,355
-My dear old friend. thanks for coming.
-Stupid ceiling.

228
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,589
Thank you.

229
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:33,636
What's that he's drinking.
do you suppose?

230
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:36,917
ldon't know. but I don't think
it's pumpkin juice.

231
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:45,476
After due consideration...

232
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,393
...the Ministry has concluded that.
for their own safety...

233
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,392
...no student under the age of 17...

234
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:55,154
...shall be allowed to put forth their
name for the Triwizard Tournament.

235
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,914
-This decision is final.
-That's rubbish!

236
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,548
That's rubbish!
You don't know what you're doing!

237
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,315
-Si|ence!
-They're not too happy about that. then.

238
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:25,228
The Goblet of Fire.

239
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:28,552
Anyone wishing to submit themselves
to the tournament...

240
00:21:28,719 --> 00:21:31,517
...need only write their name
upon a piece of parchment...

241
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,637
...and throw it in the flame before
this hour on Thursday night.

242
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,836
Do not do so lightly.

243
00:21:38,199 --> 00:21:41,635
lf chosen. there's no turning back.

244
00:21:41,799 --> 00:21:46,554
As from this moment.
the Triwizard Tournament has begun.

245
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,631
Alastor Moody.

246
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,038
Ex-Auror...

247
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:20,988
...Ministry malcontent...

248
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,509
...and your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

249
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,957
I am here because Dumbledore asked me.
End of story. goodbye. the end.

250
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:29,791
Any questions?

251
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,512
When it comes to the Dark Arts...

252
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,400
...I believe in a practical approach.

253
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:44,031
But first. which of you can tell me
how many Unforgivable Curses there are?

254
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,750
-Three. sir.
-And they are so named?

255
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:50,036
Because they are unforgivable.
The use of any one of them will--

256
00:22:50,199 --> 00:22:54,112
Will earn you a one-way ticket
to Azkaban. correct.

257
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,959
The Ministry says you're too young
to see what these curses do.

258
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,430
I say different! You need to know
what you're up against!

259
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:02,669
You need to be prepared.

260
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,195
You need to find another place
to put your chewing gum...

261
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,555
...besides the underside of your desk.
Mr. Finnigan!

262
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,597
No way. The old codger
can see out the back of his head.

263
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:12,951
And hear across classrooms!

264
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,596
So which curse shall we see first?

265
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:19,908
-Weasle
y!
-Yes?

266
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:21,353
Stand.

267
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,118
Give us a curse.

268
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:29,954
Well. my dad did tell me about one.

269
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,714
The lmperius Curse.

270
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,997
Oh. yeah. your father
would know all about that.

271
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,000
Gave the Ministry quite a bit of grief
a few years ago.

272
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,829
Perhaps this will show you why.

273
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,433
Hello.

274
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,638
Lovely little beauty.

275
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,551
Engurgiu.

276
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,511
Imp eriu !

277
00:24:03,719 --> 00:24:06,074
Don't worry. It's completely harmless.

278
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,592
If she bites...

279
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,553
...she's lethal.

280
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,712
What are you laughing at?

281
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,353
Get off!

282
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:26,397
Talented. isn't she?

283
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,790
What should I have her do next?
Jump out the window?

284
00:24:31,719 --> 00:24:33,038
Drown herself?

285
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,477
Scores of witches and wizards
have claimed...

286
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,474
...that they only did
You-Know-Who's bidding...

287
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,790
...under the influence
of the lmperius Curse.

288
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,791
But here's the rub:

289
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:58,997
How do we sort out the liars?

290
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,878
Another. another.

291
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,319
Up. up. Come on.

292
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,959
Longbottom. is it?

293
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:09,032
Up.

294
00:25:10,999 --> 00:25:14,628
Professor Sprout tells me
you have an aptitude for herbology.

295
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:18,111
There's the....

296
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,197
The Cruciatus Curse.

297
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,079
Correct. correct. Come. come.

298
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,837
Particularly nasty.

299
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:29,511
The torture curse.

300
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,550
Cruciu !

301
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:48,388
Stop it! Can't you see
it's bothering him? Stop it!

302
00:26:05,319 --> 00:26:09,153
Perhaps you could give us the last
Unforgivable Curse. Miss Granger.

303
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,754
No?

304
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,955
Avada Kedavra!

305
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:21,038
The Killing Curse.

306
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:25,156
Only one person is known
to have survived it...

307
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,954
...and he's sitting in this room.

308
00:26:58,279 --> 00:26:59,951
Brilliant. isn't he?

309
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:03,998
Completely demented. of course. and
terrifying to be in the same room with...

310
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:07,197
...but he's really been there. you know?
He's looked evil in the eye.

311
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,827
There's a reason those curses
are unforgivable.

312
00:27:09,999 --> 00:27:13,992
To perform them in a classroom....
I mean. did you see Neville's face?

313
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:18,158
Neville?

314
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,719
Son?

315
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:21,631
You all right?

316
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,790
Come on. We'll have a cup of tea.
I want to show you something.

317
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,631
We're gonna be late!

318
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,910
Come on. Cedric. Put it in!

319
00:28:11,879 --> 00:28:14,268
Eternal glory. Be brilliant. wouldn't it?

320
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,000
Three years from now.
when we're old enough to be chosen.

321
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,718
Yeah. rather you than me.

322
00:28:18,879 --> 00:28:20,710
Yes!

323
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,671
Thank you. thank you.

324
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,752
-We||. lads. we've done it.
-Cooked it up just this morning.

325
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,989
It's not going to work.

326
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:33,548
-Oh. yeah?
-And why is that. Granger?

327
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,553
You see this? This is an Age Line.

328
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,438
Dumbledore drew it himself.

329
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:39,998
So?

330
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:44,989
So a genius like Dumbledore
couldn't possibly be fooled...

331
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:48,037
...by a dodge as pathetically dimwitted
as an Aging Potion.

332
00:28:48,199 --> 00:28:52,272
-But that's why it's so brilliant.
-Because it's so pathetically dimwitted.

333
00:28:53,959 --> 00:28:55,870
-Ready. Fred?
-Ready. George.

334
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,792
-Bottoms up.
-Bottoms up.

335
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,911
-Yes!
-Yes!

336
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,153
Yeah!

337
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:07,837
Yes!

338
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,673
Ready?

339
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,910
-Yes!
-Yes!

340
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,991
-You said!
-You said!

341
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:29,196
-Oh. right. you want a piece of me?!
-|'|| tear your ears off!

342
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,749
-Now you're making me laugh.
-Take this! Come on!

343
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,319
Fight! Fight! Fight!

344
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,872
We're “old school." right?

345
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:42,314
Yeah. but you look older!

346
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,959
Sit down. Please.

347
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,993
Now the moment
you've all been waiting for:

348
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:23,195
The champion selection.

349
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,995
The Durmstrang champion
is Viktor Krum.

350
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:14,588
The champion for Beauxbatons...

351
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:16,670
...is Fleur Delacour.

352
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,677
The Hogwarts champion.
Cedric Diggory!

353
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:43,551
Excellent! We now have
our three champions.

354
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,713
But in the end.
only one will go down in history.

355
00:31:47,879 --> 00:31:51,076
Only one will hoist
this chalice of champions...

356
00:31:51,399 --> 00:31:54,277
...this vessel of victory...

357
00:31:54,439 --> 00:31:56,555
...the Triwizard Cup!

358
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,672
Harry Potter.

359
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,237
Harry Potter?

360
00:32:35,439 --> 00:32:37,555
No. No.

361
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,268
Harry Potter!

362
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,153
Go on. Harry.

363
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,992
Harry. for goodness sake.

364
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,349
He's a cheat!

365
00:33:14,879 --> 00:33:17,313
He's not even 17 yet!

366
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:47,396
-|t's wrong. I tell you!
-You French tart.

367
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:50,437
-Everything is a conspiracy theory!
-Ouiet! I can't think!

368
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:52,510
-Everything is a conspiracy theory!
-I protest.

369
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,795
-Harry.
-I protest!

370
00:33:53,959 --> 00:33:55,756
Did you put your name
in the Goblet of Fire?

371
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,990
-No. sir.
-Did you ask one of the older students...

372
00:33:58,159 --> 00:33:59,433
-...to do it for you?
-No. sir.

373
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:02,397
-You're absolutely sure?
-Yes. Yes. sir.

374
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,949
-But of course he is lying.
-The hell he is!

375
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,390
The Goblet of Fire is an exceptionally
powerful magical object.

376
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,597
Only an exceptionally powerful
Confundus Charm could've hoodwinked it.

377
00:34:10,759 --> 00:34:12,670
Magic way beyond the talents
of a fourth year.

378
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:15,717
You seem to have given this
a fair bit of thought. Mad-Eye.

379
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:18,916
It was once my job to think
as dark wizards do. Karkaroff...

380
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:22,037
-...perhaps you remember.
-This doesn't help. Alastor.

381
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,949
Leave this to you. Barty.

382
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,355
The rules are absolute.

383
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:34,114
The Goblet of Fire constitutes
a binding magical contract.

384
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,676
Mr. Potter has no choice.

385
00:34:38,439 --> 00:34:40,634
He is. as of tonight...

386
00:34:42,439 --> 00:34:44,350
...a Triwizard champion.

387
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,196
This can't go on. Albus.

388
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:16,238
First the Dark Mark. Now this?

389
00:35:16,399 --> 00:35:18,310
What do you suggest. Minerva?

390
00:35:19,439 --> 00:35:21,430
Put an end to it.

391
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,791
Don't let Potter compete.

392
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,315
You heard Barty. The rules are clear.

393
00:35:26,479 --> 00:35:29,198
Well. the devil with Barty
and his rules.

394
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,715
And since when did you
accommodate the Ministry?

395
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,714
Headmaster. I. too. find it difficult
to believe this mere coincidence.

396
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,634
However. if we are to truly discover
the meaning of these events...

397
00:35:39,799 --> 00:35:43,235
...perhaps we should.
for the time being...

398
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,270
...let them unfold.

399
00:35:46,439 --> 00:35:48,509
What--? Do nothing?

400
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,272
Offer him up as bait?

401
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,959
Potter is a boy. not a piece of meat.

402
00:35:54,799 --> 00:35:57,438
I agree. With Severus.

403
00:35:57,959 --> 00:36:00,678
Alastor. keep an eye on Harry. will you?

404
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:03,314
-I can do that.
-Don't let him know. though.

405
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,552
He must be anxious enough as it is...

406
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,640
...knowing what lies ahead.

407
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:12,427
Then again. we all are.

408
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:28,437
How did you do it?

409
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,353
Never mind. Doesn't matter.

410
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:34,350
Might've let
your best friend know. though.

411
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:37,636
-Let you know what?
-You know bloody well what.

412
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,075
I didn't ask for this to happen. Ron.

413
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:42,077
Okay?

414
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,629
-You're being stupid.
-Yeah. that's me.

415
00:36:44,799 --> 00:36:48,189
Ron Weasley.
Harry Potter's stupid friend.

416
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:53,630
ldidn't put my name in that cup.

417
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:57,715
I don't want eternal glory.
| just wanna be....

418
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,755
Look. I don't know
what happened tonight...

419
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,717
...and I don't know why.

420
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,029
It just did.

421
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,393
Okay?

422
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,512
Piss off.

423
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,275
What a charismatic quartet.

424
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:37,117
Hello.

425
00:37:37,959 --> 00:37:40,393
l'm Rita Skeeter.

426
00:37:40,959 --> 00:37:43,348
| write for the Daily Prophet.

427
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,436
But of course you know that. don't you?
It's you we don't know.

428
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,712
You're the juicy news.

429
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,919
What quirks lurk
beneath those rosy cheeks?

430
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,436
What mysteries do the muscles mask?

431
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:01,672
Does courage lie beneath those curls?

432
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,752
In short. what makes a champion tick?

433
00:38:05,239 --> 00:38:09,357
“Me. Myself 8: I“ want to know.
Not to mention my rabid readers.

434
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:11,908
So who's feeling up to sharing?

435
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,594
Shall we start with the youngest?
Lovely.

436
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,077
This is cozy.

437
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,278
It's a broom cupboard.

438
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,835
You should feel right at home. then.

439
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,679
Don't mind if I use
a Ouick-Ouotes Ouill. do you?

440
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,353
No.

441
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,591
So tell me. Harry.

442
00:38:42,759 --> 00:38:45,557
Here you sit. a mere boy of 12--

443
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:47,152
I'm 14. Sorry.

444
00:38:47,319 --> 00:38:50,152
--about to compete
against three students...

445
00:38:50,319 --> 00:38:53,470
...not only vastly more
emotionally mature than yourself...

446
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:56,107
...but who have mastered spells
that you wouldn't attempt...

447
00:38:56,279 --> 00:38:58,509
...in your dizziest daydreams.

448
00:38:58,999 --> 00:39:00,955
Concerned?

449
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,799
I don't know.
I haven't really thought about it.

450
00:39:04,959 --> 00:39:06,756
Just ignore the quill.

451
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:09,633
Then. of course.
you're no ordinary boy of 12. are you?

452
00:39:09,799 --> 00:39:12,267
-Fourteen.
-Your story's legend.

453
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,070
Do you think it was
the trauma of your past...

454
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:18,356
...that made you so keen to enter
such a dangerous tournament?

455
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:20,191
No. I didn't enter.

456
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:21,917
Of course you didn't.

457
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,638
Everyone loves a rebel. Harry.

458
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,279
Scratch that last.

459
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,640
Speaking of your parents.
were they alive...

460
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,119
...how do you think they'd feel?

461
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,952
Proud? Or concerned...

462
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,795
...that your attitude shows. at best.
a pathological need for attention...

463
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,428
...at worst. a psychotic death wish?

464
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:48,269
Hey. my eyes aren't
“glistening with the ghosts of my past.“

465
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,470
Harry, I cauldn 't risk sending Hedwig.

466
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,791
Since the World Cup, the Ministry '5
been intercepting mare and more uwls...

467
00:40:24,959 --> 00:40:27,075
...and she's too easily recognized.

468
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:29,992
We need to talk, Harry, Iace-to-Iace.

469
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:34,153
Meet me in the Gryllindor common room,
1:00 this Saturday night.

470
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,038
And make sure you're alone.

471
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:37,632
Sirius .

472
00:40:37,799 --> 00:40:39,232
P. S. .'

473
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,118
The bird bites.

474
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,393
Sirius?

475
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,431
Harry Potter, age 12...

476
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,433
...suspect entrant
in the Triwizard Tournament.

477
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,068
His eyes swimming
with the ghosts of his past...

478
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,753
...and choking back tears....

479
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,068
Sirius. How--?

480
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:37,628
I don't have much time.
so let me get straight to it.

481
00:41:37,799 --> 00:41:40,632
Did you or did you not put your name
into the Goblet of Fire?

482
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:42,198
No!

483
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,988
I had to ask.

484
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:48,755
Now. tell me about this dream of yours.
You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort.

485
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,229
But who was the third man in the room?

486
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,789
-I don't know.
-You didn't hear a name?

487
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:56,078
No.

488
00:41:56,959 --> 00:42:00,508
Voldemort was giving him a job to do.
Something important.

489
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,908
And what was that?

490
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,598
He wanted...

491
00:42:05,759 --> 00:42:07,351
...me.

492
00:42:07,879 --> 00:42:12,031
I don't know why. But he was
gonna use this man to get to me.

493
00:42:13,279 --> 00:42:15,270
But. I mean. it was only a dream. right?

494
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,278
Yes.

495
00:42:17,439 --> 00:42:18,918
It's just a dream.

496
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,993
Look. Harry.

497
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:24,516
The Death Eaters at the World Cup.
your name rising from that goblet...

498
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:28,514
...these are not just coincidences.
Hogwarts isn't safe anymore.

499
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,715
What are you saying?

500
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,953
I'm saying the devils are inside
the walls. lgor Karkaroff?

501
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:38,318
He was a Death Eater. And no one.
no one stops being a Death Eater.

502
00:42:38,759 --> 00:42:41,193
Then there's Barty Crouch.
Heart of stone.

503
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:43,634
Sent his own son to Azkaban.

504
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:50,310
You think one of them
put my name in the goblet?

505
00:42:50,479 --> 00:42:52,674
I haven't a clue who put your name
in that goblet...

506
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:56,674
...but whoever did is no friend to you.
People die in this tournament.

507
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:00,116
-|'m not ready for this. Sirius.
-You don't have a choice.

508
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:05,868
-Someone's coming.
-Keep your friends close. Harry.

509
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,917
-Who were you talking to?
-What?

510
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:13,388
-Who says I was talking to anyone?
-I heard voices.

511
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,514
Maybe you're imagining things.
Wouldn't be the first time.

512
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:21,237
You're probably just practicing
for your next interview. I expect.

513
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:47,677
Amazing.

514
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:53,109
-Amazing!
-Nevi|le. You're doing it again.

515
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,993
Right. sorry.

516
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:58,717
“Magical Water Plants
of the Highland l.ochs“?

517
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,917
Moody gave it to me.
That day we had tea.

518
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,998
It's already been through enough people.

519
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,196
Why don't you just go
and talk to him yourself?

520
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,830
Ron. this is your problem. not mine.

521
00:44:10,999 --> 00:44:12,990
What do you want me to say again?

522
00:44:13,159 --> 00:44:14,433
Go.

523
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:21,192
Ronald would like me to tell you
that Seamus told him...

524
00:44:21,799 --> 00:44:25,269
...that Dean was told by Parvati
that Hagrid's looking for you.

525
00:44:25,439 --> 00:44:27,748
Is that right? Well. you--

526
00:44:27,919 --> 00:44:28,954
What?

527
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:36,672
-Are you sure you won't do this?
-Do it.

528
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:42,193
Dean was told by Parvati that....

529
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,516
Please don't ask me to say it again.

530
00:44:45,879 --> 00:44:47,278
Hagrid's looking for you.

531
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:50,718
-Well. you can tell Ronald--
-|'m not an owl!

532
00:45:00,839 --> 00:45:02,989
Did you bring your father's cloak.
like I asked you?

533
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:05,628
Yeah. I brought the cloak.
Hagrid. where are we going?

534
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,153
You'll see soon enough.

535
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,436
Now pay attention. this is important.

536
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:12,432
What's with the flower?

537
00:45:13,479 --> 00:45:15,788
Hagrid. have you combed your hair?

538
00:45:16,199 --> 00:45:17,837
As a matter of fact. I have.

539
00:45:18,279 --> 00:45:21,077
You might like to try the same thing
now and again.

540
00:45:29,239 --> 00:45:30,638
Hagrid?

541
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,152
The cloak! Put the cloak on!

542
00:45:42,479 --> 00:45:45,755
-Eonsoir. Olympe.
-Oh. Hagrid.

543
00:45:45,919 --> 00:45:49,468
I thought perhaps you weren't coming.
I thought perhaps...

544
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,200
...you had forgotten me.

545
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,237
Couldn't forget you. Olympe.

546
00:45:54,879 --> 00:45:56,551
What is it you wanted to show me?

547
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:01,311
When we spoke earlier.
you sounded so...

548
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,073
...exhilarated.

549
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:06,358
You'll be glad you came. Trust me.

550
00:46:16,519 --> 00:46:18,191
Can we get closer?

551
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,079
Dragons?

552
00:46:27,239 --> 00:46:28,672
That's the first task?

553
00:46:29,079 --> 00:46:30,956
-You're joking.
-Come on. Harry.

554
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:35,151
These are seriously
misunderstood creatures.

555
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:37,632
Oh. crikey!

556
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,151
Although. I have to admit...

557
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:43,039
...that Horntail is a right nasty
piece of work.

558
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:45,838
Poor Ron nearly fainted
just seeing him. you know.

559
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,315
-Ron was here?
-Oh. sure.

560
00:46:49,479 --> 00:46:52,835
His brother Charlie helped
to bring him over from Romania.

561
00:46:52,999 --> 00:46:54,318
Didn't Ron tell you that?

562
00:46:56,239 --> 00:46:57,592
No. he didn't.

563
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:00,077
He didn't tell me a thing.

564
00:47:09,639 --> 00:47:12,597
-You cheat. Potter.
-You stink. Potter.

565
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:16,599
-Good luck. Potter.
-Potter stinks!

566
00:47:16,759 --> 00:47:19,319
-Cedric rules.
-Thanks.

567
00:47:20,359 --> 00:47:21,951
Like the badge?

568
00:47:22,479 --> 00:47:24,151
Excuse me.

569
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:29,558
Harry.

570
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:31,997
Hey! Read the badge. Potter!

571
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,593
Can I have a word?

572
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:36,316
-All right.
-You stink. Potter!

573
00:47:36,479 --> 00:47:39,357
-Potter. you stink!
-Harry Potter smells!

574
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:44,194
Dragons. That's the first task.

575
00:47:44,359 --> 00:47:47,396
-They've got one for each of us.
-Come on. Ced!

576
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:49,471
Are you serious?

577
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:53,151
And Fleur and Krum. do they--?

578
00:47:53,319 --> 00:47:55,469
-Yes.
-Come on. Ced. leave him.

579
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,039
-Right.
-He's not worth it.

580
00:47:57,199 --> 00:47:59,588
-Read the badges. Potter!
-Hey. listen. About the badges.

581
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,672
-|'ve asked them not to wear them. but--
-Don't worry about it.

582
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,149
It's not like I try
to blow things up. exactly.

583
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,239
It just happens a fair bit.

584
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:10,358
You have to admit. though.
fire's pretty fascinating.

585
00:48:10,519 --> 00:48:12,316
You're a right foul git. you know that?

586
00:48:12,479 --> 00:48:14,595
-You think so?
-I know so.

587
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,034
Anything else?

588
00:48:16,199 --> 00:48:19,555
-Yeah. Stay away from me.
-Fine.

589
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:25,309
-There's Potter. Cheat.
-Why so tense. Potter?

590
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:28,348
My father and l have a bet. you see.

591
00:48:28,519 --> 00:48:31,556
I don't think you're gonna last
10 minutes in this tournament.

592
00:48:34,039 --> 00:48:36,837
He disagrees.
He thinks you won't last five.

593
00:48:36,999 --> 00:48:39,991
ldon't give a damn
what your father thinks. Malfoy.

594
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:44,793
He's vile and cruel.
And you're just pathetic.

595
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,069
-Pathetic?
-Oh. no. you don't. sonny!

596
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:52,992
l'll teach you to curse someone
when their back is turned!

597
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:56,835
You stinking. cowardly. scummy...

598
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,672
-Professor Moody!
-...back-shooting--

599
00:48:58,839 --> 00:49:01,637
-What are you doing?
-Teaching.

600
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:06,593
-|s that a--? Is that a student?
-Technical|y. it's a ferret.

601
00:49:12,039 --> 00:49:13,836
Stand still! Stand still!

602
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:26,476
-My father will hear about this!
-|s that a threat?

603
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:28,517
-Professor Moody!
-|s that a threat?

604
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,432
Professor!

605
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:34,036
I could tell you stories about your father
that would curl even your greasy hair!

606
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:36,793
-A|astor! Alastor.
-It doesn't end here!

607
00:49:36,959 --> 00:49:40,588
We never use transfiguration
as a punishment!

608
00:49:40,759 --> 00:49:42,875
Surely Dumbledore told you that.

609
00:49:43,399 --> 00:49:47,677
-He might've mentioned it.
-Well. you will do well to remember it.

610
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,119
Away!

611
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:55,235
You. Come with me.

612
00:50:28,999 --> 00:50:30,990
That's a Foe-Glass.

613
00:50:31,719 --> 00:50:33,710
Lets me keep an eye on my enemies.

614
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:38,391
If I can see the whites of their eyes.
they're standing right behind me.

615
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,755
Wouldn't even bother telling you
what's in there.

616
00:50:44,919 --> 00:50:46,875
You wouldn't believe it if I did.

617
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:48,757
Now...

618
00:50:50,359 --> 00:50:53,078
...what are you going to do
about your dragon?

619
00:50:56,839 --> 00:50:59,034
Well. you know. ljust thought l'd....

620
00:51:00,439 --> 00:51:01,872
Sit.

621
00:51:05,439 --> 00:51:06,758
Listen to me. Potter.

622
00:51:07,719 --> 00:51:08,834
Your pal Diggory?

623
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,232
By your age. he could turn a whistle into
a watch and have it sing you the time.

624
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,594
Miss Delacour?

625
00:51:15,999 --> 00:51:18,593
She's as much a fairy princess as I am.

626
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:22,515
As for Krum. his head
may be filled with sawdust...

627
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,750
...but Karkaroff's is not.

628
00:51:24,919 --> 00:51:26,671
They'll have a strategy.

629
00:51:26,839 --> 00:51:30,149
And you can bet that it will
play to Krum's strengths.

630
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,313
Come on. Potter.

631
00:51:36,479 --> 00:51:38,470
What are your strengths?

632
00:51:39,999 --> 00:51:41,318
I don't know.

633
00:51:41,479 --> 00:51:44,152
Well. I can fly.
lmean. I'm a fair flyer. But l....

634
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:48,199
-Better than fair. the way I heard it.
-But I'm not allowed a broom.

635
00:51:48,359 --> 00:51:51,829
You're allowed a wand.

636
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,399
Bets! Place your bets!

637
00:51:59,559 --> 00:52:01,629
Bets taken! Bets taken here!

638
00:52:01,799 --> 00:52:04,632
Step up. folks! Who fancies a flutter
in today's bloodbath?

639
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,473
Smart money's on Krum to survive!
Any bets?

640
00:52:07,719 --> 00:52:09,152
Yes. sir?

641
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:12,040
Ten-to-1 for Fleur. There you go.
Thank you very much.

642
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,437
Your attention, please.

643
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,154
This is a great day for all of us.

644
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:24,513
Each of the three tasks involves
very considerable danger.

645
00:52:24,679 --> 00:52:27,239
Please keep your seats at all times.

646
00:52:27,399 --> 00:52:30,038
This will minimize any risks
you may be exposed to.

647
00:52:30,199 --> 00:52:33,475
-Harry? Is that you?
-Yeah.

648
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,278
I'm sure we all wish our champions...

649
00:52:35,439 --> 00:52:38,397
-How are you feeling? Okay?
-...the greatest of luck.

650
00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:43,875
The key is to concentrate.
After that. you just have to--

651
00:52:44,039 --> 00:52:45,791
Battle a dragon.

652
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,275
Young love.

653
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,194
How...

654
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:57,788
...stirring.

655
00:53:00,359 --> 00:53:03,396
If everything goes unfortunately today...

656
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:06,233
...you two may even
make the front page.

657
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,516
You have no business here.

658
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:10,591
This tent is for champions...

659
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,598
...and friends.

660
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:19,273
No matter. We've got what we wanted.

661
00:53:22,279 --> 00:53:24,998
Good day. champions.
Gather round. please.

662
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:29,153
Now. you've waited. you've wondered.
and at last the moment has arrived.

663
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:32,437
A moment only four of you
can fully appreciate.

664
00:53:32,599 --> 00:53:34,635
What are you doing here. Miss Granger?

665
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,471
Sorry. I'll just go.

666
00:53:37,639 --> 00:53:39,118
Barty. the bag.

667
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,676
Champions. in a circle around me.

668
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:44,831
Miss Delacour. over here. Mr. Krum.

669
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,754
And. Potter. Mr. Potter. over here.
That's right. Now...

670
00:53:48,919 --> 00:53:51,228
...Miss Delacour. if you will.

671
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:56,752
The Welsh Green.

672
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,428
Mr. Krum.

673
00:54:05,319 --> 00:54:07,150
The Chinese Fireball.

674
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:15,669
The Swedish Short-Snout.

675
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:18,030
-Which leaves....
-The Horntail.

676
00:54:18,199 --> 00:54:20,349
-What's that. boy?
-Nothing.

677
00:54:23,639 --> 00:54:25,948
The Hungarian Horntail.

678
00:54:28,039 --> 00:54:31,031
These represent four
very real dragons...

679
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,112
...each of which has been given
a golden egg to protect.

680
00:54:34,279 --> 00:54:36,668
Your objective is simple:

681
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:38,272
Collect the egg.

682
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:41,318
This you must do.
for each egg contains a clue...

683
00:54:41,479 --> 00:54:44,835
...without which you cannot hope
to proceed to the next task.

684
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,274
Any questions?

685
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,800
Very well. Good luck. champions.

686
00:54:49,959 --> 00:54:52,632
Mr. Diggory. at the sound of the cannon.
you may--

687
00:55:00,959 --> 00:55:04,634
Diggory! Diggory! Diggory!

688
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:18,951
Three of our champions
have now faced their dragons...

689
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:22,476
...and so each one of them
will proceed to the next task.

690
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,998
And now our fourth
and final contestant.

691
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:31,316
Harry! Harry! Harry!

692
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,478
Your wand. Harry! Your wand!

693
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,916
A ccio Firebolt!

694
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,790
-Yeah!
-Yes!

695
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,713
Oh. my God.

696
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:33,111
-Yeah!
-Yeah! Well done. dragon!

697
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:00,990
Yes! Yes!

698
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,834
-Yes. Harry!
-Knew you wouldn't die. Lose a leg.

699
01:00:25,999 --> 01:00:27,876
-Or an arm.
-Pack it in altogether?

700
01:00:28,039 --> 01:00:29,711
-Never!
-Never!

701
01:00:31,719 --> 01:00:32,993
Shush!

702
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:36,040
Go on. Harry. What's the clue?

703
01:00:36,999 --> 01:00:39,718
-Who wants me to open it?
-Yes!

704
01:00:40,519 --> 01:00:42,908
-Do you want me to open it?
-Yes!

705
01:00:53,639 --> 01:00:55,948
What the bloody hell was that?

706
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,559
All right. everyone!
Go back to your knitting.

707
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:06,599
This is gonna be uncomfortable enough
without all you nosy sods listening in.

708
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:13,394
I reckon you have to be barking mad to
put your own name in the Goblet of Fire.

709
01:01:13,799 --> 01:01:16,393
Caught on. have you?
Took you long enough.

710
01:01:17,479 --> 01:01:19,515
I wasn't the only one
who thought you'd done it.

711
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,830
Everyone was saying it
behind your back.

712
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:27,077
Brilliant.
That makes me feel loads better.

713
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:31,191
-Least I warned you about the dragons.
-Hagrid warned me about the dragons.

714
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:32,793
No. no. no. I did.

715
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:35,872
No. don't you remember?
I told Hermione to tell you...

716
01:01:36,039 --> 01:01:39,918
...that Seamus told me that Parvati
told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you.

717
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:43,868
Seamus never actually told me anything.
so it was really me all along.

718
01:01:44,839 --> 01:01:47,717
I thought we'd be all right. you know...

719
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:49,831
...after you'd figured that out.

720
01:01:50,199 --> 01:01:52,759
Who--? Who could possibly
figure that out?

721
01:01:53,399 --> 01:01:54,752
That's completely mental.

722
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:57,831
Yeah. Isn't it?

723
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,956
I suppose I was a bit distraught.

724
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:04,078
Boys.

725
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:28,913
-Hi. Harry.
-Hi. Harry.

726
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,914
Cho. Harry's looking at you.

727
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:40,318
Shush.

728
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,274
Look at this!

729
01:02:44,199 --> 01:02:46,588
I can't believe it! She's done it again.

730
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:49,749
“Miss Granger.
a plain but ambitious girl...

731
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:52,559
...seems to be developing a taste
for famous wizards.

732
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:54,915
Her latest prey. sources report...

733
01:02:55,079 --> 01:02:58,549
...is none other than the
Bulgarian bonbon. Viktor Krum.

734
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:02,594
No word yet on how Harry Potter's
taking this latest emotional blow.“

735
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,797
Parcel for you. Mr. Weasley.

736
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:07,393
Thank you. Nigel.

737
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,719
Not now. Nigel. Later.

738
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:17,958
Go on.

739
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:25,719
I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph.

740
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:29,512
Oh. look. Mum's sent me something.

741
01:03:37,319 --> 01:03:39,071
Mum sent me a dress.

742
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:42,915
Well. it does match your eyes.
Is there a bonnet?

743
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:45,112
Nose down. Harry.

744
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:49,349
-Ginny. these must be for you.
-|'m not wearing that. it's ghastly.

745
01:03:51,079 --> 01:03:52,831
What are you on about?

746
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,877
They're not for Ginny.

747
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:56,313
They're for you.

748
01:03:57,319 --> 01:04:00,914
-Dress robes.
-Dress robes? For what?

749
01:04:02,119 --> 01:04:04,189
The Yule Ball...

750
01:04:04,359 --> 01:04:09,479
...has been a tradition
of the Triwizard Tournament...

751
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:12,151
...since its inception.

752
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:16,508
On Christmas Eve night.
we and our guests...

753
01:04:16,679 --> 01:04:18,271
...gather in the Great Hall...

754
01:04:18,439 --> 01:04:22,318
...for a night of well-mannered frivolity.

755
01:04:23,799 --> 01:04:25,949
As representatives of the host school...

756
01:04:26,119 --> 01:04:30,954
...I expect each and every one of you
to put your best foot forward.

757
01:04:31,319 --> 01:04:33,833
And I mean this literally. because...

758
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:38,278
...the Yule Ball is. first and foremost...

759
01:04:39,079 --> 01:04:40,512
...a dance.

760
01:04:44,599 --> 01:04:46,317
Silence!

761
01:04:46,519 --> 01:04:49,397
The house of Godric Gryffindor
has commanded the respect...

762
01:04:49,559 --> 01:04:52,073
...of the wizard world
for nearly 10 centuries.

763
01:04:52,239 --> 01:04:56,152
I will not have you. in the course of a
single evening. besmirching that name...

764
01:04:56,320 --> 01:05:00,359
...by behaving like a babbling.
bumbling band of baboons.

765
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:02,916
Try saying that five times fast. huh?

766
01:05:03,079 --> 01:05:04,512
Now. to dance...

767
01:05:04,679 --> 01:05:08,228
...is to let the body breathe.

768
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,597
lnside every girl.
a secret swan slumbers...

769
01:05:11,759 --> 01:05:14,034
...longing to burst forth
and take flight.

770
01:05:14,199 --> 01:05:18,033
Something's about to burst out of Eloise
Midgen. but I don't think it's a swan.

771
01:05:18,199 --> 01:05:21,191
lnside every boy.
a lordly lion prepared to prance.

772
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:23,510
-Mr. Weasley.
-Yes?

773
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,989
Will you join me. please?

774
01:05:30,439 --> 01:05:33,795
Now. place your right hand
on my waist.

775
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:36,428
-Where?
-My waist.

776
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:39,033
And extend your arm.

777
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:41,357
Mr. Filch. if you please.

778
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:46,231
One. two. three.

779
01:05:46,399 --> 01:05:49,755
One. two. three. One. two. three.

780
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:55,356
Never gonna let him forget this.
are you?

781
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:56,635
-Never.
-Never.

782
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:00,509
Everybody come together.
Boys. on your feet!

783
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:24,517
Why do they have to travel in packs?

784
01:06:24,679 --> 01:06:27,193
How are you supposed to get one
on their own to ask them?

785
01:06:34,759 --> 01:06:38,115
Blimey. Harry. You've slayed dragons.
If you can't get a date. who can?

786
01:06:38,279 --> 01:06:40,429
I think I'd take the dragon right now.

787
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:47,879
I take after my mum.

788
01:06:48,039 --> 01:06:51,827
Though I didn't know her very well.
She left when l was about 3.

789
01:06:51,999 --> 01:06:53,830
No. not the maternal sort. her.

790
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,436
Broke me dad's heart. though.
He was a tiny little fella. my dad.

791
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:01,957
I could pick him up at the age of 6 with
one hand and put him up on the dresser.

792
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:04,350
He laughed so hard at that.

793
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:08,117
Very funny.

794
01:07:13,799 --> 01:07:17,394
And then he died
just when I started school. so....

795
01:07:17,559 --> 01:07:20,471
So I sort of had to make
me own way. as it were.

796
01:07:20,879 --> 01:07:22,949
But enough of me. What about you?

797
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:44,389
This is mad. At this rate. we'll be
the only ones in our year without dates.

798
01:07:46,599 --> 01:07:49,193
Well. us and Neville.

799
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:51,920
Yeah. but. then again.
he can take himself.

800
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:55,837
It might interest you to know
that Neville's already got someone.

801
01:07:58,199 --> 01:07:59,871
Now I'm really depressed.

802
01:08:05,479 --> 01:08:08,755
“Get a move on or all the good ones
will have gone.“

803
01:08:10,759 --> 01:08:12,670
Who you going with. then?

804
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:16,918
-Oi. Angelina?
-What?

805
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:22,154
Do you wanna go to the ball with me?

806
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:24,152
To the ball?

807
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:25,672
Yeah. all right.

808
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:30,759
Oi. Hermione.

809
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:32,512
You're a girl.

810
01:08:32,679 --> 01:08:33,953
Very well spotted.

811
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:35,951
Come with one of us?

812
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:43,198
Come on. It's one thing for a bloke
to show up alone.

813
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:44,793
For a girl. it's just sad.

814
01:08:44,959 --> 01:08:48,554
I won't be going alone. because.
believe it or not. someone's asked me!

815
01:08:55,239 --> 01:08:57,150
And I said yes!

816
01:08:58,919 --> 01:09:00,432
Bloody hell.

817
01:09:00,599 --> 01:09:02,191
She's lying. right?

818
01:09:02,359 --> 01:09:03,508
If you say so.

819
01:09:04,199 --> 01:09:07,396
Look. we've just gotta
grit our teeth and do it.

820
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,551
Tonight. when we get back
to the common room...

821
01:09:09,719 --> 01:09:11,357
...we'll both have partners. Agreed?

822
01:09:11,519 --> 01:09:12,952
Agreed.

823
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:37,593
-Cho!
-Harry!

824
01:09:40,999 --> 01:09:43,638
Watch yourself on the stairs.
It's a bit icy at the top.

825
01:09:43,799 --> 01:09:45,312
Okay. thanks.

826
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,589
Cho?

827
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:52,999
Yes?

828
01:09:54,319 --> 01:09:56,469
Well. | just wondered if you--

829
01:09:56,639 --> 01:09:59,278
I wondered if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.

830
01:10:00,920 --> 01:10:03,070
Sorry. I didn't catch that.

831
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:08,670
l was just wondering if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.

832
01:10:14,439 --> 01:10:15,952
Harry...

833
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:18,839
...l'm sorry. but someone's
already asked me.

834
01:10:19,799 --> 01:10:21,152
And....

835
01:10:21,799 --> 01:10:24,916
Well. I've said I'll go with him.

836
01:10:26,519 --> 01:10:28,908
Okay. Yeah. Great.

837
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:32,834
Fine. No problem.

838
01:10:33,159 --> 01:10:34,672
Okay. Good.

839
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,559
Harry?

840
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:39,878
I really am...

841
01:10:40,040 --> 01:10:41,632
...sorry.

842
01:10:50,999 --> 01:10:52,432
It's all right. Ron.

843
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:55,672
It's okay. Ron. It's all right.
It doesn't matter.

844
01:10:55,839 --> 01:10:57,636
What happened to you?

845
01:10:57,880 --> 01:10:59,950
He just asked Fleur Delacour out.

846
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:02,509
-What?
-What did she say?

847
01:11:02,679 --> 01:11:03,998
No. of course.

848
01:11:05,479 --> 01:11:08,676
-She said yes?
-Don't be silly.

849
01:11:09,079 --> 01:11:13,311
There she was. walking by.
You know how I like it when they walk.

850
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:17,510
lcouldn't help it.
It just sort of slipped out.

851
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:20,956
Actually. he sort of screamed at her.
It was a bit frightening.

852
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:25,590
-And what did you do then?
-What else? I ran for it.

853
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:29,309
I'm not cut out for this. Harry.
ldon't know what got into me.

854
01:11:29,479 --> 01:11:30,673
-Hi. Harry.
-Hi. Harry.

855
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:33,798
| always liked looking at them
from behind.

856
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:37,514
She's never gonna forgive me. ever.

857
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:39,069
Hey!

858
01:11:55,480 --> 01:11:57,118
Bloody hell.

859
01:11:59,239 --> 01:12:00,957
Bloody hell.

860
01:12:04,319 --> 01:12:05,547
Bloody. . ..

861
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:06,869
Oh. bloody....

862
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:13,034
What are those? What are those?

863
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:16,112
-My dress robes.
-Well. they're all right!

864
01:12:16,279 --> 01:12:19,077
No lace. No dodgy little collar.

865
01:12:19,239 --> 01:12:21,150
Well. I expect yours are more traditional.

866
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:26,030
Traditional?! They're ancient!
I look like my Great Aunt Tessie!

867
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:31,318
| smell like my Great Aunt Tessie.

868
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:37,632
Murder me. Harry.

869
01:12:38,959 --> 01:12:40,472
Leave it alone!

870
01:12:41,399 --> 01:12:44,675
Poor kid. I bet she's alone in her room.
crying her eyes out.

871
01:12:44,839 --> 01:12:47,228
-Who?
-Hermione. of course.

872
01:12:47,399 --> 01:12:50,835
Come on. Harry. why do you think she
wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?

873
01:12:50,999 --> 01:12:53,115
Because we'd take the mickey out of her
if she did.

874
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:58,149
Nobody asked her. Would've taken her
myself if she wasn't so bloody proud.

875
01:12:59,080 --> 01:13:00,433
-Hello. boys.
-Hello. boys.

876
01:13:00,599 --> 01:13:02,351
Don't you look...

877
01:13:02,919 --> 01:13:04,034
...dashing.

878
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:07,637
There you are. Potter.
Are you and Miss Patil ready?

879
01:13:07,799 --> 01:13:09,551
-Ready. professor?
-To dance.

880
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:12,631
lt's traditional that the three champions--
Well. in this case. four.

881
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:13,789
--are the first to dance.

882
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:16,588
-Surely I told you that.
-No.

883
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:18,872
Well. now you know.

884
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:24,429
As for you. Mr. Weasley. you may proceed
into the Great Hall with Miss Patil.

885
01:13:24,599 --> 01:13:26,829
-Oh. there you are.
-Come on. then.

886
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:28,518
Come along this way.

887
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:34,911
Oh. come on.

888
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:37,631
-Hi.
-Now. I need you all to line up...

889
01:13:37,799 --> 01:13:41,030
...in the procession. please.
Oh. you are very late.

890
01:13:43,159 --> 01:13:45,468
This way. This way. Come along.

891
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:49,230
She looks beautiful!

892
01:13:49,399 --> 01:13:50,912
Yeah. she does.

893
01:14:36,359 --> 01:14:39,795
Is that Hermione Granger?
With Viktor Krum?

894
01:14:40,399 --> 01:14:42,867
No. Absolutely not.

895
01:14:47,399 --> 01:14:48,878
Hi!

896
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:59,157
Harry. take my waist.

897
01:15:00,039 --> 01:15:01,392
-What?
-Now!

898
01:16:05,279 --> 01:16:06,951
Are you ready?

899
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:09,676
Move your body like a hairy troll

900
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:12,835
Learning to rock and roll

901
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:15,708
Spin around like a crazy ell

902
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:18,350
Dancing by himself

903
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:21,837
Boogie down like a unicorn

904
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,355
No stopping till the break of dawn

905
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:27,239
Put your hands up in the air

906
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:30,073
Like an ogre who just don 't care

907
01:16:30,759 --> 01:16:33,319
Can you dance like a Hippogrill?

908
01:16:35,559 --> 01:16:37,629
Ruddy pumpkinhead. isn't he?

909
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:42,996
I don't think it was the books
that had him going to the library.

910
01:16:44,839 --> 01:16:46,318
May l have your arm?

911
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:49,074
Arm. Leg. I'm yours.

912
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:15,473
Hot. isn't it?

913
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:19,317
Viktor's gone to go and get drinks.
Would you care to join us?

914
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:22,995
No. we'd not care to join you and Viktor.

915
01:17:24,639 --> 01:17:26,869
What's got your wand in a knot?

916
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:30,675
He's a Durmstrang.
You're fraternizing with the enemy.

917
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:34,276
The enemy?
Who was it wanting his autograph?

918
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:37,315
Besides. the whole point
of the tournament...

919
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:40,836
...is international
magical cooperation...

920
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:42,833
...to make friends.

921
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:46,597
I think he's got a bit more
than friendship on his mind.

922
01:17:56,160 --> 01:17:58,390
Are you going to ask me
to dance or not?

923
01:17:58,560 --> 01:17:59,913
No.

924
01:18:07,839 --> 01:18:10,148
-He's using you.
-How dare you?!

925
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:14,359
-Besides. I can take care of myself.
-I doubt it. He's way too old.

926
01:18:14,519 --> 01:18:18,034
-What?! What? That's what you think?
-Yeah. that's what I think.

927
01:18:18,199 --> 01:18:20,235
You know the solution then. don't you?

928
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,311
-Go on.
-Next time there's a ball...

929
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:25,472
...pluck up the courage and ask me
before somebody else does!

930
01:18:25,640 --> 01:18:27,596
And not as a last resort.

931
01:18:27,759 --> 01:18:31,798
Well. that's-- I mean.
that's just completely off the point.

932
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:33,234
Harry.

933
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:34,908
Where have you been?

934
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:37,469
Never mind! Off to bed. both of you.

935
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:44,034
-They get scary when they get older.
-Ron. you spoiled everything!

936
01:18:44,199 --> 01:18:45,996
What's this about?

937
01:18:50,119 --> 01:18:52,997
No, don 't let

938
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:58,871
This magic die

939
01:19:00,559 --> 01:19:03,232
The answer's there

940
01:19:59,159 --> 01:20:01,150
Let me see it again.

941
01:20:02,439 --> 01:20:05,192
Yes. the time is close now.

942
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:11,472
Harry, at last!

943
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:17,880
Step aside. Wormtail.
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.

944
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:29,393
You all right. Harry?

945
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:32,478
| just got in.

946
01:20:33,039 --> 01:20:34,233
Me.

947
01:20:45,039 --> 01:20:48,190
Harry. you told me
you'd figured the egg out weeks ago.

948
01:20:48,359 --> 01:20:52,352
-The task is two days from now.
-Rea|ly? I had no idea.

949
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:55,558
I suppose Viktor's
already figured it out.

950
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:58,439
Wouldn't know. We don't actually
talk about the tournament.

951
01:20:59,599 --> 01:21:04,036
Actually. we don't really talk at all.
Viktor's more of a physical being.

952
01:21:07,599 --> 01:21:10,671
| just mean he's not
particularly loquacious.

953
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:13,270
Mostly. he watches me study.

954
01:21:14,039 --> 01:21:16,030
It's a bit annoying. actually.

955
01:21:17,359 --> 01:21:19,953
You are trying to figure this egg out.
aren't you?

956
01:21:20,759 --> 01:21:22,158
What's that supposed to mean?

957
01:21:22,759 --> 01:21:25,637
It just means these tasks
are designed to test you...

958
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:28,837
...in the most brutal way.
They're almost cruel.

959
01:21:29,959 --> 01:21:31,517
And...

960
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:35,557
...l'm scared for you.

961
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:38,948
You got by the dragons
mostly on nerve.

962
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:41,949
I'm not sure it's going
to be enough this time.

963
01:21:42,119 --> 01:21:43,711
Hey. Potter!

964
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:50,673
-Potter!
-Cedric.

965
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:54,872
How--? How are you?

966
01:21:55,879 --> 01:21:57,232
Spectacular.

967
01:21:58,720 --> 01:22:02,395
I realize I never really thanked you properly
for tipping me off about those dragons.

968
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:04,755
Forget it. I'm sure you
would've done the same for me.

969
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:06,593
Exactly.

970
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:10,029
You know the Prefects' bathroom
on the fifth floor?

971
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:16,268
It's not a bad place for a bath.

972
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:20,357
Just take your egg...

973
01:22:21,079 --> 01:22:23,718
...and mull things over
in the hot water.

974
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:59,550
I must be out of my mind.

975
01:23:09,319 --> 01:23:11,389
I'm definitely out of my mind.

976
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:17,111
I'd try putting it in the water
if I were you.

977
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:19,077
Myrtle!

978
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:20,912
Hello. Harry.

979
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:24,752
Long time no see.

980
01:23:28,839 --> 01:23:32,354
l was circling a blocked drain
the other day...

981
01:23:32,519 --> 01:23:35,829
...and could swear I saw a bit
of Polyjuice Potion.

982
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,230
Not being a bad boy again.
are you. Harry?

983
01:23:38,399 --> 01:23:40,071
Polyjuice Potion?

984
01:23:40,839 --> 01:23:44,673
Kicked the habit. Myrtle. did you say.
“Try putting it in the water“?

985
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:52,832
That's what he did.

986
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:55,232
The other boy...

987
01:23:56,599 --> 01:23:58,590
...the handsome one...

988
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:01,114
...Cedric.

989
01:24:04,279 --> 01:24:06,839
Well. go on. Open it.

990
01:24:14,599 --> 01:24:19,389
Come seek us
Where our voices sound

991
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:24,031
We cannot sing
Above the ground

992
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:28,352
An hour long you'll have to look

993
01:24:29,119 --> 01:24:33,590
To recover what we took

994
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:42,873
Myrtle...

995
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:47,510
...there aren't merpeople
in the Black Lake. are there?

996
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:49,952
Very good.

997
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:54,998
It took Cedric ages to riddle it out.

998
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:59,075
Almost all the bubbles were gone.

999
01:25:16,040 --> 01:25:17,917
Harry. tell me again.

1000
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:22,279
“Come seek us
where our voices sound.“

1001
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:24,874
The Black Lake. that's obvious.

1002
01:25:25,799 --> 01:25:28,233
“An hour long you'll have to look.“

1003
01:25:28,399 --> 01:25:31,709
Again. obvious. Though. admittedly.
potentially problematic.

1004
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:34,837
“Potentially problematic“?

1005
01:25:34,999 --> 01:25:38,116
When's the last time you held your breath
underwater for an hour. Hermione?

1006
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:42,792
Look. Harry. we can do this.
The three of us can figure it out.

1007
01:25:42,959 --> 01:25:45,348
Hate to break up the skull session.

1008
01:25:45,519 --> 01:25:47,430
Professor McGonagall
wants you in her office.

1009
01:25:47,680 --> 01:25:49,955
Not you. Potter.
just Weasley and Granger.

1010
01:25:50,119 --> 01:25:52,679
But. sir. the second task
is only hours away. and--

1011
01:25:52,839 --> 01:25:55,353
Exactly. Presumably Potter
is well prepared by now...

1012
01:25:55,519 --> 01:25:57,316
...and could do with
a good night's sleep.

1013
01:25:57,479 --> 01:25:59,868
Go. Now!

1014
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:11,158
Longbottom!

1015
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:13,231
Why don't you help Potter
put his books back.

1016
01:26:21,559 --> 01:26:23,675
You know.
if you're interested in plants...

1017
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:26,308
...you'd be better off with
Goshawk's Guide to Herbology.

1018
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:31,038
Do you know there's a wizard in Nepal
who's growing gravity-resistant trees?

1019
01:26:31,200 --> 01:26:34,795
Neville. no offense.
but I really don't care...

1020
01:26:35,399 --> 01:26:37,037
...about plants.

1021
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:38,998
Now. if there's...

1022
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:43,756
...a Tibetan turnip that will allow me
to breathe underwater for an hour...

1023
01:26:43,919 --> 01:26:46,308
...then great. But otherwise--

1024
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:50,109
I don't know about a turnip.
But you could always use gillyweed.

1025
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:54,039
-Any bets? Any bets?
-Come on. place your bets!

1026
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:55,599
Step up. mates! Don't be shy.

1027
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:57,159
-Three lads.
-One lady.

1028
01:26:57,320 --> 01:26:59,390
-Four go down.
-But do four come up?

1029
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:00,993
Don't be so mean.

1030
01:27:01,599 --> 01:27:03,317
-Any bets?
-F|eur's 10-1.

1031
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:07,351
-You're sure about this. Neville?
-Abso|ute|y.

1032
01:27:07,519 --> 01:27:09,350
-For an hour?
-Most likely.

1033
01:27:09,519 --> 01:27:10,952
Most likely?

1034
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:13,236
Well. there is some debate
among herbologists...

1035
01:27:13,399 --> 01:27:15,754
...as to the effects of fresh water
versus salt water--

1036
01:27:15,919 --> 01:27:18,479
You're telling me this now?
You must be joking!

1037
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:20,517
| just wanted to help.

1038
01:27:20,679 --> 01:27:23,671
Well. that makes you a right sight
better than Ron and Hermione.

1039
01:27:23,839 --> 01:27:25,511
Where are they anyway?

1040
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:28,592
-You seem a little tense. Harry.
-Do I?

1041
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:37,470
Welcome to the second task.

1042
01:27:37,640 --> 01:27:41,155
Last night, something was stolen
from each of our champions.

1043
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:42,639
A treasure of sorts.

1044
01:27:42,799 --> 01:27:45,313
These four treasures,
one for each champion...

1045
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:48,074
...now lie on the bottom
of the Black Lake.

1046
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:49,753
In order to win...

1047
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:53,595
...each champion need only find
their treasure and return to the surface.

1048
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:56,274
-Simple enough, except for this:
-Put that in your mouth.

1049
01:27:56,440 --> 01:27:59,910
They will have but one hour to do so,
and one hour only.

1050
01:28:00,079 --> 01:28:03,788
After that, they'll be on their own.
No magic will save them.

1051
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:06,470
You may begin
at the sound of the cannon.

1052
01:28:31,919 --> 01:28:34,752
-What's the matter with him?
-I don't know. I can't see him.

1053
01:28:36,039 --> 01:28:38,837
Oh. my God.
l've killed Harry Potter.

1054
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:42,477
Yeah!

1055
01:28:43,599 --> 01:28:45,157
What?

1056
01:30:01,479 --> 01:30:03,549
The Beauxbatons champion,
Miss Delacour...

1057
01:30:03,719 --> 01:30:06,108
...has unfortunately
been forced to retire...

1058
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:09,718
...so she will take no further part
in this task.

1059
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:26,038
But she's my friend too!

1060
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:29,272
Only one!

1061
01:32:18,519 --> 01:32:20,316
Let's get down below.

1062
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:32,679
Krum! Krum! Krum!

1063
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:29,472
Yes!

1064
01:33:46,839 --> 01:33:48,830
Ascendio!

1065
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,478
Harry!

1066
01:33:57,680 --> 01:33:59,079
He's all right.

1067
01:34:00,239 --> 01:34:01,638
He's all right. Barty!

1068
01:34:01,799 --> 01:34:05,075
-Go get him another towel.
-I want all the judges over here now!

1069
01:34:05,639 --> 01:34:08,949
You saved her. even though
she wasn't yours to save.

1070
01:34:09,639 --> 01:34:11,197
My little sister.

1071
01:34:11,639 --> 01:34:13,152
Thank you.

1072
01:34:13,919 --> 01:34:16,513
And you! You helped.

1073
01:34:17,159 --> 01:34:20,037
Well. yeah. a bit.

1074
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:28,075
-Harry!
-Hermione!

1075
01:34:28,239 --> 01:34:30,799
Are you all right? You must be freezing.

1076
01:34:31,999 --> 01:34:33,830
Personally. I think
you behaved admirably.

1077
01:34:33,999 --> 01:34:35,955
I finished last. Hermione.

1078
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:40,719
Next to last.
Fleur never got past the Grindylows.

1079
01:34:40,879 --> 01:34:43,996
Krum! Krum! Krum!

1080
01:34:44,159 --> 01:34:46,912
-Come on! Come on!
-Attention!

1081
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:51,674
Attention!

1082
01:34:52,119 --> 01:34:55,828
The winner is Mr. Diggory...

1083
01:34:56,239 --> 01:34:59,595
...who showed innate command
of the Bubble-Head Charm.

1084
01:34:59,759 --> 01:35:02,319
However. seeing as Mr. Potter
would have finished first...

1085
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:07,235
...had it not been for his determination
to rescue not only Mr. Weasley...

1086
01:35:07,399 --> 01:35:11,517
...but the others as well.
we've agreed to award him...

1087
01:35:11,679 --> 01:35:13,590
...second place...

1088
01:35:13,759 --> 01:35:15,158
-Second place!
-Well done!

1089
01:35:15,320 --> 01:35:17,880
...for outstanding moral fiber!

1090
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:20,559
Yes!

1091
01:35:23,919 --> 01:35:25,637
-Right on.
-All that moral fiber. eh?

1092
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:27,392
-|t's great.
-Mora| fiber?

1093
01:35:27,559 --> 01:35:29,789
Blimey. Even when you go wrong.
it turns out right.

1094
01:35:29,959 --> 01:35:32,519
-Yeah. well done. Moral Fiber.
-Congratu|ations. Potter.

1095
01:35:32,679 --> 01:35:34,271
-A fine achievement.
-Thank you.

1096
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:35,919
Well done. boy.

1097
01:35:36,079 --> 01:35:39,196
-See you at Hagrid's. Harry.
-|'m sorry we haven't spoken.

1098
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:43,194
After all. your story is one
I've heard so many times.

1099
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:47,470
Ouite remarkable. really.
Tragic. of course...

1100
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:49,517
...to lose one's family.

1101
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:53,550
Never whole again. are we?

1102
01:35:55,720 --> 01:35:57,676
Still. life goes on...

1103
01:35:58,360 --> 01:35:59,952
...and here we stand.

1104
01:36:02,759 --> 01:36:05,319
I'm sure your parents would be
very proud of you today. Potter.

1105
01:36:05,480 --> 01:36:06,913
Bartemius!

1106
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:11,039
Not trying to lure Potter into one of the
Ministry's summer internships. are we?

1107
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:14,476
The last boy who went into the
Department of Mysteries never came out!

1108
01:36:26,239 --> 01:36:28,036
And they say I'm mad.

1109
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:40,509
Now. I remember--
I remember when | first met you all.

1110
01:36:40,680 --> 01:36:43,558
Biggest bunch of misfits
I ever set eyes on.

1111
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:46,548
Suppose you remind me
of meself a little.

1112
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:50,599
-And here we all are. four years later.
-We're still a bunch of misfits.

1113
01:36:50,759 --> 01:36:53,956
Well. maybe.
but we've all got each other.

1114
01:36:54,119 --> 01:36:55,598
And Harry. of course.

1115
01:36:55,759 --> 01:37:00,913
Soon to be the youngest
Triwizard champion there's ever been!

1116
01:37:01,119 --> 01:37:03,075
Hooray!

1117
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:06,829
Hogwarts, Hogwarts
Hoggy Warty Hogwarts

1118
01:37:06,999 --> 01:37:09,513
Teach us something, please

1119
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:20,513
Mr. Crouch?

1120
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:30,756
A man has died here. Fudge. And he
won't be the last. You must take action.

1121
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:32,433
I will not.

1122
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:36,513
In times like these. the wizard world looks
to its leaders for strength. Dumbledore!

1123
01:37:36,679 --> 01:37:37,998
Then for once show them some!

1124
01:37:38,160 --> 01:37:42,039
The Triwizard Tournament will not be
canceled. I will not be seen as a coward!

1125
01:37:42,199 --> 01:37:45,271
A true leader does what is right.
no matter what others think.

1126
01:37:45,439 --> 01:37:48,112
-What did you say to me?
-Excuse me. gentlemen.

1127
01:37:48,279 --> 01:37:51,794
It may interest you to know
this conversation is no longer private.

1128
01:37:55,960 --> 01:37:57,473
Oh. Harry!

1129
01:37:57,639 --> 01:37:59,834
Harry. how good to see you again.

1130
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:02,072
I can come back later. professor.

1131
01:38:02,239 --> 01:38:05,470
Not necessary. Harry. The minister and l
are done. I'll be back in a moment.

1132
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:08,074
Minister. after you.

1133
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:10,511
There you are. Your hat.

1134
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:14,195
Oh. Harry. do feel free to indulge in
a little Licorice Snap in my absence.

1135
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:17,397
But I have to warn you.
they're a wee bit sharp.

1136
01:39:45,160 --> 01:39:46,673
Professor?

1137
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:49,274
-Professor.
-Yeah.

1138
01:39:59,720 --> 01:40:03,349
lgor Karkaroff. you have been brought
from Azkaban at your own request...

1139
01:40:03,519 --> 01:40:05,350
...to present evidence to this council.

1140
01:40:05,519 --> 01:40:08,113
Should your testimony
prove consequential...

1141
01:40:08,279 --> 01:40:12,192
...council may be prepared
to order your immediate release.

1142
01:40:12,359 --> 01:40:16,750
Until such time. you remain in the eyes
of the Ministry a convicted Death Eater.

1143
01:40:16,919 --> 01:40:18,477
Do you accept these terms?

1144
01:40:19,079 --> 01:40:21,639
-I do. sir.
-And what do you wish to present?

1145
01:40:21,999 --> 01:40:24,354
l have names. sir.

1146
01:40:24,879 --> 01:40:28,349
There was Rosier. Evan Rosier.

1147
01:40:30,919 --> 01:40:33,308
-Rosier is dead.
-He took a piece of me with him...

1148
01:40:33,479 --> 01:40:35,515
-...though. didn't he?
-I didn't know.

1149
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:38,234
-If that is all the witness has to offer--
-No. no. no.

1150
01:40:38,399 --> 01:40:41,550
There was Rookwood! He was a spy.

1151
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:43,995
Augustus Rookwood?
Of the Department of Mysteries?

1152
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:45,275
Yeah. the same.

1153
01:40:45,439 --> 01:40:48,988
He passed information to You-Know-Who
from inside the Ministry itself.

1154
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:53,311
Very well. Council will deliberate.

1155
01:40:53,480 --> 01:40:55,357
In the meantime.
you will return to Azkaban.

1156
01:40:55,519 --> 01:41:00,035
No! Wait. please! Please. I have more!
What about Snape? Severus Snape?

1157
01:41:00,200 --> 01:41:03,078
As the council is aware.
I've given evidence on this matter.

1158
01:41:03,239 --> 01:41:07,027
Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater
and. prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall...

1159
01:41:07,199 --> 01:41:10,077
-...turned spy for us at great personal risk.
-|t's a lie!

1160
01:41:10,239 --> 01:41:13,549
-Today he's no more a Death Eater than I.
-Snape remains faithful to the Dark Lord!

1161
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:15,870
Silence!

1162
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:19,756
Unless the witness possesses
any genuine name of consequence...

1163
01:41:19,919 --> 01:41:21,955
...this session is now concluded.

1164
01:41:22,119 --> 01:41:24,075
Oh. no, no, no.

1165
01:41:24,999 --> 01:41:26,432
I've heard about one more.

1166
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:29,034
-What's that?
-The name.

1167
01:41:29,200 --> 01:41:30,599
-Yes?
-I know for a fact...

1168
01:41:30,759 --> 01:41:32,715
...this person took part
in the capture...

1169
01:41:32,879 --> 01:41:34,949
...and. by means
of the Cruciatus Curse...

1170
01:41:35,119 --> 01:41:38,475
...torture of the Auror Frank Longbottom
and his wife!

1171
01:41:38,639 --> 01:41:40,869
The name.
Give me the wretched name!

1172
01:41:41,039 --> 01:41:43,473
Barty Crouch...

1173
01:41:46,079 --> 01:41:47,068
...Junior.

1174
01:41:56,160 --> 01:41:57,798
Hold him down!

1175
01:42:01,279 --> 01:42:04,749
Get your filthy hands off me.
you pathetic little men!

1176
01:42:06,399 --> 01:42:07,912
Hello. Father.

1177
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:11,236
You are no son of mine.

1178
01:42:22,119 --> 01:42:26,397
Curiosity is not a sin. Harry.
But you should exercise caution.

1179
01:42:27,719 --> 01:42:29,038
It's a Pensieve.

1180
01:42:29,200 --> 01:42:33,671
Very useful if. like me.
you find your mind a wee bit stretched.

1181
01:42:33,839 --> 01:42:37,229
It allows me to see once more
things I've already seen.

1182
01:42:37,679 --> 01:42:40,512
You see. Harry. I have searched
and searched for something...

1183
01:42:40,679 --> 01:42:42,192
...some small detail...

1184
01:42:43,560 --> 01:42:45,596
...something I might have overlooked...

1185
01:42:45,759 --> 01:42:49,798
...something that would explain why
these terrible things have happened.

1186
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:54,269
Every time | get close to an answer.
it slips away.

1187
01:42:55,279 --> 01:42:56,837
lt's maddening.

1188
01:42:59,119 --> 01:43:00,757
Sir? Mr. Crouch's son.

1189
01:43:01,479 --> 01:43:03,470
What exactly happened to him?

1190
01:43:03,639 --> 01:43:08,235
He was sent to Azkaban.
Destroyed Barty to do it.

1191
01:43:08,879 --> 01:43:12,349
But he had no choice.
The evidence was overwhelming.

1192
01:43:13,759 --> 01:43:16,592
-Why do you ask?
-|t's just that l....

1193
01:43:17,319 --> 01:43:19,355
I had a dream about him.

1194
01:43:21,519 --> 01:43:24,192
It was in the summer. before school.

1195
01:43:26,279 --> 01:43:29,157
In the dream, I was in a house.

1196
01:43:29,319 --> 01:43:33,915
And Voldemort was there,
only he wasn 't quite human.

1197
01:43:34,080 --> 01:43:37,550
And Wormtail was there too.
And Mr. Crouch 's son.

1198
01:43:37,919 --> 01:43:40,638
-Have there been others like this dream?
-Yes.

1199
01:43:41,439 --> 01:43:42,997
Always the same one.

1200
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:48,150
Sir. these dreams...

1201
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:53,314
...what I see. you don't think
it's actually happening. do you?

1202
01:43:54,840 --> 01:43:57,718
I think it's unwise for you
to linger over these dreams. Harry.

1203
01:43:58,200 --> 01:44:00,077
I think it's best if you simply...

1204
01:44:05,480 --> 01:44:07,198
...cast them away.

1205
01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:19,868
It's a sign. Severus.
You know what it means as well as l.

1206
01:44:28,239 --> 01:44:29,388
Potter!

1207
01:44:29,560 --> 01:44:31,994
What's your hurry?

1208
01:44:36,879 --> 01:44:40,508
Congratulations. your performance
in the Black Lake was inspiring.

1209
01:44:40,679 --> 01:44:42,829
Gillyweed. am I correct?

1210
01:44:43,559 --> 01:44:45,038
Yes. sir.

1211
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:47,279
Ingenious.

1212
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:52,828
A rather rare herb. gillyweed.

1213
01:44:53,639 --> 01:44:56,995
Not something found
in your everyday garden.

1214
01:44:58,599 --> 01:45:00,476
Nor is this.

1215
01:45:04,519 --> 01:45:06,111
Know what it is?

1216
01:45:07,360 --> 01:45:08,713
Bubble juice. sir?

1217
01:45:09,279 --> 01:45:11,076
Veritaserum.

1218
01:45:11,799 --> 01:45:15,348
Three drops of this and You-Know-Who
himself would spill his darkest secrets.

1219
01:45:15,519 --> 01:45:20,468
The use of it on a student is.
regrettably. forbidden. However...

1220
01:45:21,119 --> 01:45:24,031
...should you ever steal
from my personal stores again...

1221
01:45:24,200 --> 01:45:28,830
...my hand might just slip over
your morning pumpkin juice.

1222
01:45:28,999 --> 01:45:33,231
-I haven't stolen anything.
-Don't lie to me.

1223
01:45:34,319 --> 01:45:39,791
Gillyweed may be innocuous.
but boomslang skin. lacewing flies?

1224
01:45:40,479 --> 01:45:43,676
You and your little friends are brewing
Polyjuice Potion. and believe me...

1225
01:45:43,839 --> 01:45:45,955
...l'm going to find out why!

1226
01:46:11,679 --> 01:46:13,192
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

1227
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:33,079
Sonorus!

1228
01:46:37,159 --> 01:46:42,279
Earlier today. Professor Moody placed
the Triwizard Cup deep within the maze.

1229
01:46:42,439 --> 01:46:47,194
Only he knows its exact position.
Now. as Mr. Diggory...

1230
01:46:49,200 --> 01:46:50,918
...and Mr. Potter...

1231
01:46:52,720 --> 01:46:54,392
...are tied for first position...

1232
01:46:54,559 --> 01:46:58,518
...they will be the first to enter the maze.
followed by Mr. Krum...

1233
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:03,030
-...and Miss Delacour.
-Come on! Krum! Krum! Krum!

1234
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:06,832
The first person to touch the cup
will be the winner!

1235
01:47:10,999 --> 01:47:13,638
l've instructed the staff
to patrol the perimeter.

1236
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:16,598
Should. at any point. a contestant wish
to withdraw from the task...

1237
01:47:16,759 --> 01:47:21,071
...he or she need only send up
red sparks with their wands.

1238
01:47:21,399 --> 01:47:25,153
Contestants! Gather around. Ouickly!

1239
01:47:28,159 --> 01:47:32,311
In the maze. you'll find no dragons
or creatures of the deep.

1240
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:35,711
Instead. you'll face something
even more challenging.

1241
01:47:35,879 --> 01:47:38,757
You see. people change in the maze.

1242
01:47:38,919 --> 01:47:40,557
Oh. find the cup if you can.

1243
01:47:40,720 --> 01:47:45,316
But be very wary. you could just
lose yourselves along the way.

1244
01:47:46,720 --> 01:47:49,598
Champions. prepare yourselves!

1245
01:47:58,279 --> 01:47:59,678
Good luck.

1246
01:48:00,039 --> 01:48:01,916
-My boy.
-See you later. Dad.

1247
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:06,668
On the count of three. One--

1248
01:51:25,959 --> 01:51:27,108
Fleur?

1249
01:51:28,719 --> 01:51:30,118
Fleur.

1250
01:51:33,519 --> 01:51:35,271
Periculum !

1251
01:52:12,360 --> 01:52:13,793
Get down!

1252
01:52:14,319 --> 01:52:15,991
Get down!

1253
01:52:16,600 --> 01:52:17,794
Exp elliarm us!

1254
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:30,072
No. don't! Stop!
He's bewitched. Cedric!

1255
01:52:30,240 --> 01:52:32,196
-Get off me!
-He's bewitched!

1256
01:52:43,399 --> 01:52:44,991
Yes.

1257
01:53:04,999 --> 01:53:06,717
Harry!

1258
01:53:08,959 --> 01:53:10,517
Harry!

1259
01:53:12,799 --> 01:53:14,152
Harry!

1260
01:53:16,520 --> 01:53:18,033
Harry!

1261
01:53:19,959 --> 01:53:21,631
Reducto!

1262
01:53:37,759 --> 01:53:40,148
-Thanks.
-No problem.

1263
01:53:40,520 --> 01:53:45,036
You know. for a moment there.
I thought you were gonna let it get me.

1264
01:53:45,199 --> 01:53:46,871
For a moment. so did I.

1265
01:53:48,679 --> 01:53:49,794
Some game. huh?

1266
01:53:50,760 --> 01:53:52,113
Some game.

1267
01:53:57,320 --> 01:53:58,912
Go!

1268
01:54:08,640 --> 01:54:11,552
Go on. take it.
You saved me. take it!

1269
01:54:11,719 --> 01:54:13,630
-Together. One. two...
-Two. ..

1270
01:54:13,800 --> 01:54:14,949
-...three!
-...three!

1271
01:54:26,960 --> 01:54:29,713
-You okay?
-Yeah. You?

1272
01:54:36,519 --> 01:54:37,793
Where are we?

1273
01:54:43,239 --> 01:54:44,831
I've been here before.

1274
01:54:48,320 --> 01:54:49,833
It's a Portkey.

1275
01:54:51,600 --> 01:54:55,639
-Harry. the cup is a Portkey.
-|'ve been here before. in a dream.

1276
01:54:57,640 --> 01:55:00,871
Cedric! We have to get back
to the cup. Now!

1277
01:55:01,039 --> 01:55:02,916
What are you talking about?

1278
01:55:07,959 --> 01:55:10,757
-Harry! What is it?
-Get back to the cup!

1279
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:20,310
-Who are you? What do you want?
-Kill the spare.

1280
01:55:20,479 --> 01:55:23,118
-A vada Keda vra!
-No! Cedric!

1281
01:55:33,959 --> 01:55:35,756
Do it! Now!

1282
01:55:47,239 --> 01:55:49,628
Bone of the father...

1283
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:52,598
...unwillingly given.

1284
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:02,072
Flesh of the servant...

1285
01:56:04,039 --> 01:56:07,076
...willingly sacrificed.

1286
01:56:10,999 --> 01:56:14,594
And blood of the enemy...

1287
01:56:20,160 --> 01:56:22,549
...forcibly taken.

1288
01:56:28,359 --> 01:56:31,192
The Dark Lord shall rise...

1289
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:33,797
...again.

1290
01:57:34,600 --> 01:57:37,831
My wand. Wormtail.

1291
01:57:46,999 --> 01:57:48,876
Hold out your arm.

1292
01:57:49,040 --> 01:57:50,598
Master.

1293
01:57:50,760 --> 01:57:53,274
Thank you. master.

1294
01:57:53,439 --> 01:57:54,838
The other arm. Wormtail.

1295
01:58:33,800 --> 01:58:35,631
Welcome. my friends.

1296
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,639
Thirteen years it's been. and yet...

1297
01:58:40,239 --> 01:58:45,518
...here you stand before me
as though it were only yesterday.

1298
01:58:46,439 --> 01:58:49,237
I confess myself...

1299
01:58:49,679 --> 01:58:51,192
...disappointed.

1300
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:53,831
Not one of you tried to find me.

1301
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:57,231
Crabbe! Macnair!

1302
01:58:58,120 --> 01:58:59,394
Goyle!

1303
01:59:01,800 --> 01:59:03,358
Not even you...

1304
01:59:07,080 --> 01:59:08,911
...Lucius.

1305
01:59:10,679 --> 01:59:15,309
My Lord. had I detected any sign.
a whisper of your whereabouts--

1306
01:59:15,479 --> 01:59:18,357
There were signs. my slippery friend.
And more than whispers.

1307
01:59:18,519 --> 01:59:23,468
I assure you. my Lord.
I have never renounced the old ways.

1308
01:59:25,120 --> 01:59:30,513
The face I have been obliged to present
each day since your absence...

1309
01:59:32,439 --> 01:59:34,953
...that is my true mask.

1310
01:59:35,319 --> 01:59:36,832
I returned.

1311
01:59:39,199 --> 01:59:42,908
Out of fear. not loyalty.

1312
01:59:44,039 --> 01:59:49,557
Still. you have proved yourself useful
these past few months. Wormtail.

1313
01:59:54,559 --> 01:59:56,789
Thank you. master.

1314
01:59:57,360 --> 01:59:59,032
Thank you.

1315
02:00:01,999 --> 02:00:04,274
-Such a handsome boy.
-Don't touch him!

1316
02:00:05,679 --> 02:00:07,112
Harry.

1317
02:00:07,280 --> 02:00:09,953
I'd almost forgotten you were here.

1318
02:00:10,120 --> 02:00:14,352
Standing on the bones
of my father. Yeah.

1319
02:00:14,520 --> 02:00:15,839
I'd introduce you...

1320
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:20,118
...but word has it you're almost
as famous as me these days.

1321
02:00:22,679 --> 02:00:25,239
The boy who lived.

1322
02:00:25,400 --> 02:00:28,198
How lies have fed your legend. Harry.

1323
02:00:28,360 --> 02:00:32,194
Shall I reveal what really happened
that night 13 years ago?

1324
02:00:32,359 --> 02:00:36,875
Shall I divulge how
I truly lost my powers?

1325
02:00:37,040 --> 02:00:38,473
Yes. shall I?

1326
02:00:38,920 --> 02:00:40,194
It was love.

1327
02:00:40,360 --> 02:00:44,672
You see. when dear. sweet Lily Potter
gave her life for her only son...

1328
02:00:44,840 --> 02:00:47,308
...she provided the ultimate protection.

1329
02:00:47,719 --> 02:00:49,437
I could not touch him.

1330
02:00:50,600 --> 02:00:52,670
It was old magic.

1331
02:00:52,839 --> 02:00:54,989
Something I should have foreseen.

1332
02:00:55,160 --> 02:00:56,878
But no matter. no matter.

1333
02:00:57,039 --> 02:00:59,155
Things have changed.

1334
02:00:59,880 --> 02:01:03,236
I can touch you...

1335
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:05,478
...now.

1336
02:01:13,320 --> 02:01:14,594
Yeah.

1337
02:01:20,679 --> 02:01:24,194
Astonishing what a few drops
of your blood will do. eh. Harry?

1338
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:26,952
Pick up your wand. Potter.

1339
02:01:28,520 --> 02:01:30,636
I said. pick it up! Get up! Get up!

1340
02:01:32,199 --> 02:01:34,394
You've been taught how to duel.
I presume. yes?

1341
02:01:34,560 --> 02:01:36,869
First. we bow to each other.

1342
02:01:37,039 --> 02:01:39,348
Come on. now. Harry.
The niceties must be observed.

1343
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:42,592
Dumbledore wouldn't want you
to forget your manners. would he?

1344
02:01:42,759 --> 02:01:44,033
I said. bow.

1345
02:01:45,799 --> 02:01:49,951
-That's better. And now....
-No.

1346
02:01:50,359 --> 02:01:52,156
Crucio !

1347
02:01:54,520 --> 02:01:56,192
Crucio !

1348
02:01:57,199 --> 02:01:59,076
Attaboy. Harry.

1349
02:01:59,239 --> 02:02:01,275
Your parents would be proud.

1350
02:02:01,560 --> 02:02:04,836
Especially your filthy Muggle mother.

1351
02:02:04,999 --> 02:02:06,512
Exp elliar--

1352
02:02:09,400 --> 02:02:11,709
I'm going to kill you. Harry Potter.

1353
02:02:11,879 --> 02:02:13,790
I'm going to destroy you.

1354
02:02:15,880 --> 02:02:21,238
After tonight. no one will ever again
question my powers.

1355
02:02:21,839 --> 02:02:24,307
After tonight. if they speak of you...

1356
02:02:24,479 --> 02:02:27,039
...they'll speak only of how you...

1357
02:02:27,320 --> 02:02:29,072
...begged for death.

1358
02:02:29,239 --> 02:02:32,834
And I. being a merciful Lord...

1359
02:02:33,360 --> 02:02:34,918
...obliged.

1360
02:02:35,239 --> 02:02:36,672
Get up!

1361
02:02:41,479 --> 02:02:43,356
Don't you turn your back on me.
Harry Potter!

1362
02:02:43,520 --> 02:02:45,670
I want you to look at me
when I kill you!

1363
02:02:45,839 --> 02:02:48,911
I want to see the light
leave your eyes!

1364
02:03:02,279 --> 02:03:03,951
Have it your way.

1365
02:03:04,959 --> 02:03:07,234
-Exp elliarm us!
-A vada Keda vra!

1366
02:03:24,040 --> 02:03:26,600
Do nothing! He's mine to finish!

1367
02:03:30,999 --> 02:03:32,637
He's mine!

1368
02:04:04,360 --> 02:04:08,194
Harry. when the connection is broken.
you must get to the Portkey.

1369
02:04:08,360 --> 02:04:10,316
We can linger for a moment
to give you some time...

1370
02:04:10,480 --> 02:04:12,198
...but only a moment.
Do you understand?

1371
02:04:13,320 --> 02:04:16,232
Harry. take my body back. will you?

1372
02:04:16,400 --> 02:04:18,834
Take my body back to my father.

1373
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:21,114
Let go.

1374
02:04:21,559 --> 02:04:23,436
Sweetheart. you're ready.

1375
02:04:24,239 --> 02:04:26,753
Let go! Let go!

1376
02:04:32,279 --> 02:04:33,598
Accio!

1377
02:04:39,080 --> 02:04:40,991
No!

1378
02:04:53,200 --> 02:04:54,758
He did it!

1379
02:04:55,920 --> 02:04:57,512
Harry!

1380
02:05:00,199 --> 02:05:01,632
Harry!

1381
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:05,877
No! No! No. don't!

1382
02:05:06,160 --> 02:05:07,957
For God's sake. Dumbledore.
what's happened?

1383
02:05:08,239 --> 02:05:10,707
He's back. He's back.

1384
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:12,836
Voldemort's back.

1385
02:05:12,999 --> 02:05:15,274
Cedric. he asked me
to bring his body back.

1386
02:05:15,439 --> 02:05:17,669
I couldn't leave him. not there.

1387
02:05:17,840 --> 02:05:20,513
It's all right. Harry. It's all right.

1388
02:05:20,679 --> 02:05:22,909
He's home. You both are.

1389
02:05:23,079 --> 02:05:26,549
Keep everybody in their seats.
A boy has just been killed.

1390
02:05:29,480 --> 02:05:32,950
The body must be moved. Dumbledore.
There are too many people.

1391
02:05:33,280 --> 02:05:34,918
Let me through.

1392
02:05:35,079 --> 02:05:36,512
Let me through!

1393
02:05:38,359 --> 02:05:39,553
Let me through!

1394
02:05:39,719 --> 02:05:41,072
That's my son!

1395
02:05:42,320 --> 02:05:43,719
That's my boy!

1396
02:05:46,439 --> 02:05:49,033
It's my boy!

1397
02:05:51,719 --> 02:05:55,155
-Come on. Get up. Easy. easy!
-No.

1398
02:05:55,319 --> 02:05:58,152
This is not where you want to be
right now. Come on.

1399
02:05:58,799 --> 02:06:00,915
No!

1400
02:06:03,879 --> 02:06:06,154
It's all right. I got you.

1401
02:06:06,320 --> 02:06:09,517
I got you. Come on. Easy. now.

1402
02:06:13,360 --> 02:06:15,078
No!

1403
02:06:16,160 --> 02:06:17,957
No!

1404
02:06:58,599 --> 02:07:00,237
Are you all right. Potter?

1405
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:02,631
Does it hurt? That?

1406
02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:04,518
Not so much now.

1407
02:07:05,440 --> 02:07:07,431
Perhaps I'd better take a look at it.

1408
02:07:10,439 --> 02:07:12,350
The cup was a Portkey.

1409
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:16,712
Someone had bewitched it.

1410
02:07:16,999 --> 02:07:18,990
What was it like?

1411
02:07:19,319 --> 02:07:20,911
-What was he like?
-Who?

1412
02:07:21,080 --> 02:07:22,752
The Dark Lord.

1413
02:07:24,999 --> 02:07:27,957
What was it like
to stand in his presence?

1414
02:07:29,160 --> 02:07:30,912
I don't know.

1415
02:07:33,639 --> 02:07:36,437
It was like I'd fallen
into one of my dreams...

1416
02:07:39,280 --> 02:07:41,191
...into one of my nightmares.

1417
02:07:59,160 --> 02:08:00,673
Were there others?

1418
02:08:00,839 --> 02:08:02,989
In the graveyard. were there others?

1419
02:08:06,759 --> 02:08:08,112


1420
02:08:08,800 --> 02:08:12,554
I don't think I said anything
about a graveyard. professor.

1421
02:08:19,720 --> 02:08:22,837
“Marvelous creatures. dragons.
aren't they?“

1422
02:08:27,080 --> 02:08:29,992
Did you think that miserable oaf
would've led you into the woods...

1423
02:08:30,160 --> 02:08:31,991
...if I hadn't suggested it?

1424
02:08:35,399 --> 02:08:38,914
Do you think Cedric Diggory would've
told you to open the egg underwater...

1425
02:08:39,080 --> 02:08:41,469
...if I hadn't told him first myself?

1426
02:08:43,040 --> 02:08:45,600
Did you think Neville Longbottom.
the witless wonder...

1427
02:08:45,759 --> 02:08:48,831
...could've provided you with gillyweed
if I hadn't given him the book...

1428
02:08:48,999 --> 02:08:50,478
...that led him straight to it?

1429
02:08:58,560 --> 02:09:02,394
It was you from the beginning.
You put my name in the Goblet of Fire.

1430
02:09:02,920 --> 02:09:06,435
-You bewitched Krum. but you--
-“But-- But--“

1431
02:09:06,599 --> 02:09:08,669
You won because I made it so. Potter.

1432
02:09:09,280 --> 02:09:12,636
You ended up in that graveyard tonight
because it was meant to be so.

1433
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:14,028
And now the deed is done.

1434
02:09:15,639 --> 02:09:19,791
The blood that runs through these veins
runs within the Dark Lord.

1435
02:09:27,960 --> 02:09:31,316
Imagine how he will reward me
when he learns...

1436
02:09:32,199 --> 02:09:34,588
...that I have once and for all...

1437
02:09:35,200 --> 02:09:39,352
...silenced the great Harry Potter.

1438
02:09:39,519 --> 02:09:40,713
Exp elliarm us!

1439
02:09:45,240 --> 02:09:46,434
Severus.

1440
02:09:48,839 --> 02:09:50,272
That's it. take it.

1441
02:09:52,160 --> 02:09:55,470
-Do you know who I am?
-A|bus Dumbledore.

1442
02:09:55,640 --> 02:09:58,234
-Are you Alastor Moody? Are you?
-No.

1443
02:09:58,400 --> 02:10:01,358
Is he in this room? Is he in this room?

1444
02:10:04,279 --> 02:10:05,758
Harry. away from there!

1445
02:10:25,880 --> 02:10:29,077
-You all right. Alastor?
-|'m sorry. Albus.

1446
02:10:29,999 --> 02:10:31,990
That's Moody. But then who's--?

1447
02:10:33,719 --> 02:10:34,754
Polyjuice Potion.

1448
02:10:34,919 --> 02:10:38,036
Now we know who's been stealing
from your stores. Severus.

1449
02:10:38,279 --> 02:10:40,110
We'll get you up in a minute.

1450
02:11:13,159 --> 02:11:14,478
Harry!

1451
02:11:17,999 --> 02:11:20,115
Barty Crouch Junior.

1452
02:11:20,359 --> 02:11:23,157
I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

1453
02:11:25,439 --> 02:11:26,588
Your arm. Harry.

1454
02:11:30,759 --> 02:11:32,909
You know what this means. don't you?

1455
02:11:33,799 --> 02:11:35,073
He's back.

1456
02:11:36,199 --> 02:11:38,269
Lord Voldemort has returned.

1457
02:11:39,160 --> 02:11:41,390
I'm sorry. sir. I couldn't help it.

1458
02:11:41,600 --> 02:11:45,957
Send an ow! to Azkaban. I think
they'll find they're missing a prisoner.

1459
02:11:46,400 --> 02:11:48,789
-|'|| be welcomed back like a hero.
-Perhaps.

1460
02:11:49,319 --> 02:11:52,072
Personally. I've never had much time
for heroes.

1461
02:12:11,159 --> 02:12:13,719
Today. we acknowledge...

1462
02:12:14,400 --> 02:12:17,039
...a really terrible loss.

1463
02:12:19,079 --> 02:12:21,718
Cedric Diggory was. as you all know...

1464
02:12:21,879 --> 02:12:24,109
...exceptionally hard-working...

1465
02:12:25,040 --> 02:12:27,235
...infinitely fair-minded...

1466
02:12:27,799 --> 02:12:29,994
...and. most importantly...

1467
02:12:30,279 --> 02:12:34,670
...a fierce. fierce friend.

1468
02:12:35,760 --> 02:12:39,958
Now. I think. therefore. you have
the right to know exactly how he died.

1469
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:44,359
You see...

1470
02:12:45,160 --> 02:12:47,151
...Cedric Diggory was murdered...

1471
02:12:48,039 --> 02:12:49,950
...by Lord Voldemort!

1472
02:12:51,759 --> 02:12:55,195
The Ministry of Magic
does not wish me to tell you this.

1473
02:12:55,800 --> 02:12:59,349
But not to do so. I think.
would be an insult to his memory.

1474
02:13:01,439 --> 02:13:03,031
Now. the pain...

1475
02:13:03,200 --> 02:13:06,715
...we all feel at this dreadful loss
reminds me...

1476
02:13:06,880 --> 02:13:08,154
...and reminds us...

1477
02:13:08,320 --> 02:13:11,869
...that while we may come from different
places and speak in different tongues...

1478
02:13:12,039 --> 02:13:15,315
...our hearts beat as one.

1479
02:13:15,799 --> 02:13:17,755
In light of recent events...

1480
02:13:18,080 --> 02:13:22,790
...the bonds of friendship we've made
this year will be more important than ever.

1481
02:13:23,639 --> 02:13:28,759
Remember that. and Cedric Diggory
will not have died in vain.

1482
02:13:29,159 --> 02:13:31,229
You remember that...

1483
02:13:31,800 --> 02:13:34,712
...and we'll celebrate a boy who was...

1484
02:13:35,239 --> 02:13:37,594
...kind and honest...

1485
02:13:38,080 --> 02:13:42,471
...and brave and true.
right to the very end.

1486
02:14:06,680 --> 02:14:08,636
I never liked these curtains.

1487
02:14:09,200 --> 02:14:11,760
Set them on fire in my fourth year.

1488
02:14:12,080 --> 02:14:13,832
By accident. of course.

1489
02:14:19,280 --> 02:14:23,478
I put you in terrible danger
this year. Harry. I'm sorry.

1490
02:14:26,759 --> 02:14:28,351
Professor...

1491
02:14:28,560 --> 02:14:31,438
...when I was in the graveyard.
there was a moment...

1492
02:14:32,200 --> 02:14:36,432
...when Voldemort's wand and mine
sort of connected.

1493
02:14:37,960 --> 02:14:40,190
Priori In can ta tem .

1494
02:14:44,160 --> 02:14:46,754
You saw your parents that night.
didn't you?

1495
02:14:47,319 --> 02:14:49,071
They reappeared.

1496
02:14:50,479 --> 02:14:54,108
No spell can reawaken the dead. Harry.
I trust you know that.

1497
02:14:56,559 --> 02:14:59,073
Dark and difficult times lie ahead.

1498
02:14:59,520 --> 02:15:04,150
Soon we must all face the choice
between what is right and what is easy.

1499
02:15:07,399 --> 02:15:08,991
But remember this:

1500
02:15:09,160 --> 02:15:10,991
You have friends here.

1501
02:15:12,920 --> 02:15:14,592
You're not alone.

1502
02:15:34,439 --> 02:15:36,111
Hermione.

1503
02:15:36,519 --> 02:15:38,430
This is for you.

1504
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,116
Write to me. Promise.

1505
02:15:42,160 --> 02:15:43,513
Bye.

1506
02:15:49,480 --> 02:15:51,357
Au revoir. Ron.

1507
02:16:33,480 --> 02:16:35,914
Do you think we'll ever just have
a quiet year at Hogwarts?

1508
02:16:36,080 --> 02:16:37,149
-No.
-No.

1509
02:16:37,319 --> 02:16:41,517
No. I didn't think so. Oh. well.
What's life without a few dragons?

1510
02:16:45,759 --> 02:16:48,478
Everything's going to change now.
isn't it?

1511
02:16:55,480 --> 02:16:56,879
Yes.

1512
02:17:01,439 --> 02:17:04,590
Promise you'll write this summer.
Both of you.

1513
02:17:04,759 --> 02:17:07,227
I won't. You know I won't.

1514
02:17:08,439 --> 02:17:12,034
-Harry will. won't you?
-Yeah. Every week.
