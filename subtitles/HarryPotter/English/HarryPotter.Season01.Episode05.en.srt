I dun 't knuw abuut yuu,

00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:57,951
And it's guing ta get even warse.
Temperatures in the mid-30s Celsius...

3
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,669
...that's the mid-90s Fahrenheit,
turnurruw, maybe even hitting 100.

4
00:01:01,839 --> 00:01:04,399
Sn, please, remember ta caver up

5
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,278
with the huttest hits an yuur FM dial.

6
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,078
Come on. guys. time to go home.

7
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,835
Come on. love. off you get.

8
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:17,995
-Do we have to?
-Yes. we do.

9
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,398
I'll make you your favorite dinner
to compensate.

10
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:24,311
He squealed like a pig. didn't he?

11
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,869
Yeah. brilliant punch. Big D.
Did you see his face?

12
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:29,791
Hey. Big D.

13
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,198
Beat up another 10-year-old?

14
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,749
-This one deserved it.
-Yeah.

15
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,393
-Five against one. very brave.
-We|l. you're one to talk.

16
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,588
Moaning in your sleep every night?
At least I'm not afraid of my pillow.

17
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:49,398
“Don't kill Cedric. “

18
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,391
Who's Cedric. your boyfriend?

19
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:56,513
-Shut up.
-“He's going to kill me. Mum.“

20
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,070
Where is your mum?

21
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:02,393
Where is your mum. Potter?

22
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:04,511
She dead?

23
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,232
Is she dead?

24
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:08,993
Is she a dead Pott--?

25
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,357
-Dud|ey.
-Dud|ey. let's go.

26
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,911
-What's going on?
-What are you doing?

27
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:31,912
-|'m not doing anything.
-We're getting out of here. Dudley.

28
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,558
Come on. Dudley. hurry up.

29
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,717
Dudley. run.

30
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,238
Expectu Patrunum.

31
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:29,597
Mrs. Figg.

32
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:35,310
Don't put away your wand. Harry.

33
00:04:35,599 --> 00:04:37,874
They might come back.

34
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,953
Dementors in Little Whinging.
whatever next?

35
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,908
-Who|e world's gone topsy-turvy.
-I don't understand. How do you know--?

36
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:48,195
Dumbledore asked me
to keep an eye on you.

37
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,591
Dumbledore asked you?
You know Dumbledore?

38
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,434
After You-Know-Who
killed that poor Diggory boy last year...

39
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:58,159
...did you expect him to let you
go wandering on your own?

40
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:00,879
Good Lord. boy.
They told me you were intelligent.

41
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,031
Now. get inside and stay there.

42
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,670
Expect someone will be in touch soon.
Whatever happens. don't leave the house.

43
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,995
It is hut. That's right, hut everywhere.

44
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,196
There 's sweat. There 's stilling.

45
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:24,190
Diddykins?

46
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,431
Is that you?

47
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:32,511
Duddy. Vernon. come quick.

48
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,589
We're going to have to
take him to a hospital.

49
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,796
Who did this to you. boy?

50
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:43,711
Happy. are we. now?

51
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,560
You've finally done it.
You've finally driven him loopy.

52
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,439
Vernon. don't say that.

53
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:54,751
Well. just look at him. Petunia.
Our boy has gone yumpy.

54
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:56,990
I've reached my limit. do you hear?

55
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,835
This is the last I'm gonna take
of you and your nonsense.

56
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,191
-Dear Mr. Potter.
-What?

57
00:06:16,359 --> 00:06:21,387
The Ministry has received intelligence
that at 6:23 this evening...

58
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,111
...you performed the Patronus Charm
in the presence of a Muggle.

59
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,276
As a clear violation...

60
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,353
...of the Decree for the Reasonable
Restriction of Underage Sorcery...

61
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:34,555
...you are hereby expelled...

62
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:38,269
...from Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

63
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:43,191
Hoping you are well. Mafalda Hopkirk.

64
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,390
Justice.

65
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,230
He's not very well.

66
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,997
Sorry. Hedwig.

67
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,158
Very clean. these Muggles.

68
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:26,272
-Tonks. for God's sake.
-Unnatura|.

69
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:31,558
Professor Moody.

70
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,912
-What are you doing here?
-Rescuing you. of course.

71
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,273
But where are we going?
The letter said I've been expelled.

72
00:08:40,439 --> 00:08:42,748
You haven't been. Not yet.
Kingsley. you take point.

73
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,909
But the letter said--

74
00:08:44,079 --> 00:08:46,957
Dumbledore persuaded the minister
to suspend your expulsion...

75
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,190
-...pending a formal hearing.
-A hearing?

76
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,591
Don't worry. We'll explain everything
when we get back to headquarters.

77
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:54,954
Not here. Nymphadora.

78
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,795
Don't call me Nymphadora.

79
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,879
Stay in formation. everyone.
Don't break ranks if one of us is killed.

80
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,591
Come on. you. around the corner.

81
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,959
Come on.

82
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,478
In you go. son.

83
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:43,392
There've been no sightings.

84
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,198
No deaths. No proof.

85
00:10:45,359 --> 00:10:48,112
He almost killed Harry.
If that isn't proof enough....

86
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:52,033
Yes. but guarding you-know-what
is the most important....

87
00:10:54,239 --> 00:10:56,548
We must trust Dumbledore on this.

88
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,952
Was he able to protect Harry last year?
Tonight I say it's time to take action.

89
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,192
Cornelius Fudge is a politician first
and a wizard second.

90
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,397
-His instinct would be to ignore it--
-Keep your voices down.

91
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:11,792
He's getting stronger and stronger
by the minute. We have to act now.

92
00:11:15,599 --> 00:11:17,794
-Harry.
-Mrs. Weasley.

93
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,749
Heavens. you're all right.

94
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,669
Bit peaky. but I'm afraid dinner will wait
until after the meeting's finished.

95
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,755
Nope. No time to explain.
Straight upstairs. first door on the left.

96
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,519
Yeah.

97
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:43,674
Mudblood. werewolves.
traitors. thieves.

98
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:48,516
If my poor mistress
knew the scum they let into her house...

99
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,875
...what would she say to old Kreacher?

100
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:54,757
Oh. the shame.

101
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,233
-FreaIrs.
-There. there. mistress.

102
00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:12,670
Scum a! the earth.
Nut like it was in the days a! my fathers.

103
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:15,353
Kreacher is here.

104
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,639
Oh. Harry.

105
00:12:23,319 --> 00:12:26,994
Are you all right? We overheard them
talking about the Dementor attack.

106
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:29,878
-You must tell us everything.
-Let the man breathe. Hermione.

107
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,079
And this hearing at the Ministry.
It's just outrageous.

108
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,310
I've looked it up.
They simply can't expel you.

109
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:39,073
-|t's completely unfair.
-Yeah.

110
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,074
There's a lot of that
going round at the moment.

111
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:45,756
So. what is this place?

112
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,514
-|t's headquarters.
-Of the Order of the Phoenix.

113
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,713
It's a secret society.

114
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:53,313
Dumbledore formed it back when
they fought You-Know-Who.

115
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,948
Couldn't have put any of this
in a letter. I suppose?

116
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,716
I've gone all summer
without a scrap of news.

117
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,749
We wanted to write. mate.
Really. we did.

118
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,909
-On|y. . ..
-Only What?

119
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,151
Only Dumbledore made us swear
not to tell you anything.

120
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:10,517
Dumbledore said that?

121
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:14,878
But why would he keep me in the dark?
Maybe I could help.

122
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,917
I'm the one
who saw Voldemort return...

123
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:19,798
...the one who fought him.
who saw Cedric Diggory get killed.

124
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:22,075
-Harry.
-Thought we heard your dulcet tones.

125
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,119
-Don't bottle it up. though. Let it out.
-If you're all done shouting....

126
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,668
Do you wanna hear something
a little more interesting?

127
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,157
If anyone has a right to know, it's Harry.
I! it wasn 't for Harry...

128
00:13:33,319 --> 00:13:35,275
we wouldn't even know
Vuldemurt was back.

129
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,952
He 's not a child, Mully.

130
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,395
But he's not an adult either.

131
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:42,477
-lle's nut James, Sirius.
-Well, he's not your sun.

132
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,709
He 's as good as.

133
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:46,717
-Whu else has he gut?
-Hey. Ginny.

134
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,188
-lle's gut me.
-lluw tuuchingly paternal, Black.

135
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,352
Perhaps Putter will grow up
to he a felon, just like his gudlather.

136
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,192
Now, you stay out a! this, Snivellus.

137
00:13:54,359 --> 00:13:56,350
-Snape's part of the Order?
-Git.

138
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,272
--ahuut yuur suppused relurmatiun.

139
00:13:58,439 --> 00:14:01,078
-I know better.
-Su why dun 't you tell him?

140
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,878
-Get off it.
-Ouick.

141
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,598
-Get it up.
-Crookshanks.

142
00:14:04,999 --> 00:14:07,069
-Stop it.
-Get off. you bloody cat.

143
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,390
-Crookshanks. Leave it alone.
-Get it up.

144
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,794
-Hermione. I hate your cat.
-Bad Crookshanks.

145
00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:18,559
Well. we'll be eating
down in the kitchen.

146
00:14:19,439 --> 00:14:21,669
Just because you're allowed
to use magic now...

147
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,751
...does not mean you have to
whip your wands out for everything.

148
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,433
Hi. Mum.

149
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,037
You hungry. Harry?

150
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,713
You sure you're all right. Harry?
Gave us quite a turn.

151
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:33,949
Harry Potter.

152
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,797
Sirius.

153
00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:45,469
This is very. very peculiar.

154
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:49,154
It seems your hearing in the Ministry
is to be before the entire Wizengamot.

155
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:52,629
I don't understand. What has
the Ministry of Magic got against me?

156
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,795
Show him. He'll find out soon enough.

157
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:09,637
He's been attacking Dumbledore as well.

158
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:16,190
Fudge is using all his power. including
his influence at the Daily Prophet...

159
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,398
...to smear anyone who claims
the Dark Lord has returned.

160
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,788
Why?

161
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,837
He thinks Dumbledore's after his job.

162
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:25,035
No one in their right mind
could believe that--

163
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,953
Exactly the point.
Fudge isn't in his right mind.

164
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,554
It's been twisted and warped by fear.

165
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:34,468
Now. fear makes people
do terrible things. Harry.

166
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,995
The last time
Voldemort gained power...

167
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:40,356
...he almost destroyed
everything we hold most dear.

168
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,274
Now he's returned. and I'm afraid
the minister will do almost anything...

169
00:15:44,439 --> 00:15:47,237
...to avoid facing that terrifying truth.

170
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,951
We think Voldemort
wants to build up his army again.

171
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,600
Fourteen years ago.
he had huge numbers at his command.

172
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:01,150
And not just witches and wizards.
but all manner of dark creatures.

173
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,599
He's been recruiting heavily. and we've
been attempting to do the same.

174
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,109
But gathering followers
isn't the only thing he's interested in.

175
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,672
We believe...

176
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,477
...Voldemort may be after something.

177
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:18,708
Sirius.

178
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,953
Something he didn't have last time.

179
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,316
You mean like a weapon?

180
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,359
No. That's enough. He's just a boy.

181
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:35,238
You say more and you might as well
induct him into the Order.

182
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,029
Good. I want to join. lf Voldemort's
raising an army. then I want to fight.

183
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,797
Harry.

184
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,109
You are hereby expelled.

185
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,953
Before the entire Wizengamot.

186
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:08,637
Trains. Underground.

187
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,994
Ingenious. these Muggles.

188
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,231
Here we are.

189
00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:35,237
I've never used the visitors' entrance
before. Should be fun.

190
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:40,072
Right. Good.
I'll just get my Muggle money.

191
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,238
Terrible. Lost a lot of Galleons
trading on the potions market.

192
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,551
Daily Prophet. ladies and gentlemen.
Anybody for Daily Prophet?

193
00:18:24,719 --> 00:18:27,597
Dumbledore: Is he daft.
or is he dangerous?

194
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:51,352
-Morning. Arthur.
-Morning. Bob.

195
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,393
Interdepartmental memos.

196
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:59,347
We used to use owls.
Mess was unbelievable.

197
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:07,555
Merlin's beard. Thank you. Kingsley.

198
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,472
They've changed the time
of your hearing.

199
00:19:09,639 --> 00:19:10,958
When is it?

200
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,157
In five minutes.

201
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,592
Department of Mysteries.

202
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:29,998
And I'm confident. minister.
that you will do the right thing.

203
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:32,195
Yes. but we must be--

204
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,315
Remember. during the hearing.
speak only when you're spoken to.

205
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,870
Keep calm.
You've done nothing wrong.

206
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:49,310
As the Muggles say. truth will out.

207
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:51,073
Yes?

208
00:19:52,199 --> 00:19:54,429
I'm not allowed in. I'm afraid.

209
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,672
Good luck. Harry.

210
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,869
Disciplinary hearing
of the 12th of August...

211
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:06,872
...into offenses committed
by Harry James Potter...

212
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,509
...resident at Number 4 Privet Drive.
Little Whinging. Surrey.

213
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:13,637
Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge.
Minister of Mag--

214
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:15,551
Witness for the defense.

215
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,757
Albus Percival Wulfric...

216
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:22,355
...Brian Dumbledore.

217
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,791
You got our message
that the time and place of the hearing...

218
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,394
-...had been changed. did you?
-I must have missed it.

219
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,347
But by a happy mistake. I arrived
at the Ministry three hours early.

220
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,349
The charges?

221
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,909
The charges against the accused
are as follows:

222
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:40,671
“That he did knowingly...

223
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,230
...and in full awareness
of the illegality of his actions...

224
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,278
...produce a Patronus Charm...

225
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,557
...in the presence of a Muggle.“

226
00:20:50,719 --> 00:20:53,870
-Do you deny producing said Patronus?
-No. but--

227
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:57,349
And you were aware that you were
forbidden to use magic outside school...

228
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,273
-...while under the age of 17?
-Yes. I was. but--

229
00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:03,670
Witches and wizards
of the Wizengamot--

230
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:05,955
I was only doing it
because of the Dementors.

231
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:10,157
Dementors?

232
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,352
In Little Whinging?

233
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,750
That's quite clever.

234
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:17,956
Muggles can't see Dementors.
can they. boy?

235
00:21:18,199 --> 00:21:20,235
-High|y convenient.
-|'m not lying.

236
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,868
-There were two of them. if I hadn't--
-Enough.

237
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:27,078
I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure
would be a very well-rehearsed story...

238
00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:31,551
...but since you can produce
no witnesses of the event--

239
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:36,111
Pardon me. minister.
but as it happens. we can.

240
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:42,277
Please describe the attack.

241
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:46,677
What did they look like?

242
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:52,439
Well. one of them was very large
and the other rather skinny.

243
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:56,198
Not the boys. The Dementors.

244
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,875
Oh, right, right. Well, big.

245
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,437
Cloaked. Then everything went cold...

246
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:09,315
...as though all the happiness
had gone from the world.

247
00:22:09,479 --> 00:22:14,348
Now. look here. Dementors don't just
wander into a Muggle suburb...

248
00:22:14,519 --> 00:22:17,989
...and happen across a wizard.
The odds are astronomical.

249
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:19,831
I don't think anyone would believe...

250
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,912
...the Dementors were there
by coincidence. minister.

251
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:28,072
I'm sure I must have misunderstood you.
professor.

252
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,519
Dementors are. after all. under
the control of the Ministry of Magic.

253
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,718
And it's so silly of me. but it sounded
for a moment as though...

254
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,714
...you were suggesting that the Ministry
had ordered the attack on this boy.

255
00:22:41,879 --> 00:22:44,552
That would be disturbing indeed.
Madam Undersecretary...

256
00:22:44,719 --> 00:22:48,712
...which is why I'm sure the Ministry
will be mounting a full-scale inquiry...

257
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,111
...into why the two Dementors
were so very far from Azkaban...

258
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:55,510
...and why they mounted an attack
without authorization.

259
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,476
Of course. there is someone...

260
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,313
...who might be behind the attack.

261
00:23:04,199 --> 00:23:08,636
Cornelius. I implore you to see reason.

262
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:13,156
The evidence that the Dark Lord
has returned is incontrovertible.

263
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,993
He is not back.

264
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,756
In the matter of Harry Potter...

265
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,628
...the law clearly states...

266
00:23:26,879 --> 00:23:31,077
...that magic may be used before
Muggles in life-threatening situations.

267
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,038
Laws can be changed if necessary.
Dumbledore.

268
00:23:34,199 --> 00:23:37,236
Clearly. Has it become practice
to hold a full criminal trial...

269
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,153
...to deal with a simple matter
of underage magic?

270
00:23:48,199 --> 00:23:51,635
Those in favor of conviction?

271
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:04,834
Those in favor
of clearing the accused of all charges?

272
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:20,509
Cleared of all charges.

273
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,112
Professor.

274
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,478
Padfoot. Are you barking mad?

275
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,915
You'll blow the entire operation.

276
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:53,473
Sirius. what are you doing here?
If somebody sees you....

277
00:24:53,639 --> 00:24:56,153
I had to see you off. didn't I?

278
00:24:57,879 --> 00:25:00,268
What's life without a little risk?

279
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,710
I don't wanna see you
get chucked back in Azkaban.

280
00:25:02,879 --> 00:25:04,278
Don't worry about me.

281
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:09,470
Anyway. I wanted you to have this.

282
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:17,551
Original Order of the Phoenix.

283
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:19,717
Marlene McKinnon.

284
00:25:19,879 --> 00:25:22,347
She was killed
two weeks after this was taken.

285
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,757
Voldemort wiped out her entire family.

286
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,878
Frank and Alice Longbottom.

287
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,473
Neville's parents.

288
00:25:29,639 --> 00:25:33,154
They suffered a fate worse than death.
you ask me.

289
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,395
It's been 14 years.

290
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,239
And still a day doesn't go by
I don't miss your dad.

291
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,280
Do you really think
there's going to be a war. Sirius?

292
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,752
It feels like it did before.

293
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,518
You keep it.

294
00:26:00,999 --> 00:26:05,197
Anyway. I suppose
you're the young ones now.

295
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,072
I'll see you at the train.

296
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,196
Bye-bye. darling.

297
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:13,472
I love you.

298
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:16,110
Hold my hand. Iovey.

299
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,555
There they are.
They're in the far carriage.

300
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,948
Bye.

301
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,238
I'm surprised the Ministry's
still letting you walk around free.

302
00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:04,832
Better enjoy it while you can.

303
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:08,150
I expect there's a cell in Azkaban
with your name on it.

304
00:27:10,639 --> 00:27:14,427
-What'd I tell you? Complete nutter.
-Just stay away from me!

305
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,352
It's only Malfoy.

306
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:19,911
What'd you expect?

307
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,195
Hi. guys.

308
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,952
-Hey. Neville.
-Hey there. Neville.

309
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,959
What is it?

310
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,157
-What's what?
-That. Pulling the carriage.

311
00:28:01,959 --> 00:28:04,189
Nothing's pulling the carriage. Harry.

312
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,915
It's pulling itself. like always.

313
00:28:19,999 --> 00:28:22,115
You're not going mad.

314
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,750
I can see them too.

315
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,428
You're just as sane as I am.

316
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,036
Everyone. this is Loony Love--

317
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,551
Luna Lovegood.

318
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,550
What an interesting necklace.

319
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,150
It's a charm. actually.

320
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,993
Keeps away the Nargles.

321
00:28:56,639 --> 00:28:58,072
Hungry.

322
00:28:58,719 --> 00:29:00,596
I hope there's pudding.

323
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:04,995
-What's a Nargle?
-No idea.

324
00:29:17,199 --> 00:29:18,757
Good evening. children.

325
00:29:19,999 --> 00:29:22,593
Now. we have two changes
in staffing this year.

326
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:25,671
We're pleased to welcome back
Professor Grubbly-Plank...

327
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,308
...who'll be taking
Care of Magical Creatures...

328
00:29:28,479 --> 00:29:31,789
...while Professor Hagrid
is on temporary leave.

329
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,434
We also wish to welcome our new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher...

330
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,637
...Professor Dolores Umbridge.

331
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:43,515
And I'm sure you'll all join me
in wishing the professor good luck.

332
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:49,069
Now. as usual. our caretaker. Mr. Filch.
has asked me to remind you--

333
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,314
She was at my hearing.
She works for Fudge.

334
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,952
Thank you. headmaster.
for those kind words of welcome.

335
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:12,794
And how lovely to see all your bright...

336
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,679
...happy faces smiling up at me.

337
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:20,989
I'm sure we're all going
to be very good friends.

338
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:23,309
-That's likely.
-That's likely.

339
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:28,872
The Ministry of Magic
has always considered...

340
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:34,432
...the education of young witches
and wizards to be of vital importance.

341
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:36,954
Although each headmaster...

342
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:41,749
...has brought something new
to this historic school...

343
00:30:43,239 --> 00:30:49,155
...progress for the sake of progress
must be discouraged.

344
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,515
Let us preserve
what must be preserved...

345
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,035
...perfect what can be perfected...

346
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:03,548
...and prune practices
that ought to be prohibited.

347
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:14,278
Thank you. Professor Umbridge.
That really was most illuminating.

348
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,592
-|||uminating? What a load of waffle.
-What's it mean?

349
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:21,389
Magic is forbidden in the corridors....

350
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,996
It means the Ministry's
interfering at Hogwarts.

351
00:31:43,959 --> 00:31:45,631
Dean. Seamus.

352
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,956
-Good holiday?
-All right.

353
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,436
Better than Seamus'. anyway.

354
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,950
Me mum didn't want me
to come back this year.

355
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:57,270
-Why not?
-Let me see. Because of you.

356
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,911
The Daily Prophet's been saying a lot
of things about you and Dumbledore.

357
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,354
What. your mum believes them?

358
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:04,350
Nobody was there
the night Cedric died.

359
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:07,477
I guess you should read the Prophet,
then. like your stupid mother.

360
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:10,995
-Don't talk about my mother.
-|'|| have a go at anyone calling me a liar.

361
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:13,548
-What's going on?
-He's mad. is what's going on.

362
00:32:13,719 --> 00:32:16,677
Do you believe the rubbish he's
come out with about You-Know-Who?

363
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,432
Yeah. I do.

364
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:21,276
Has anyone else
got a problem with Harry?

365
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,629
-You all right?
-Fine.

366
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,472
Seamus was bang out of order. mate.

367
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:39,634
-But he'll come through. you'll see.
-I said. I'm fine. Ron.

368
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:47,392
Right. I'll just leave you
to your thoughts. then.

369
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:15,628
Harry.

370
00:33:30,439 --> 00:33:32,509
Bring it over here. Over here.

371
00:33:33,399 --> 00:33:36,152
Oh. go on. Seamus. Go on. get it.

372
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,513
Good morning. children.

373
00:33:54,439 --> 00:33:59,388
Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations.

374
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,028
O-W-Ls.

375
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,591
More commonly known as OWLs.

376
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:09,751
Study hard and you will be rewarded.

377
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:15,107
Fail to do so.
and the consequences may be severe.

378
00:34:20,479 --> 00:34:25,314
Your previous instruction in this subject
has been disturbingly uneven.

379
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,550
But you'll be pleased to know.
from now on...

380
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:31,075
...you will be following a carefully
structured. Ministry-approved...

381
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:33,799
...course of defensive magic. Yes?

382
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,594
There's nothing in here
about using defensive spells?

383
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,239
Using spells?

384
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,710
Well. I can't imagine why you would
need to use spells in my classroom.

385
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,873
We're not gonna use magic?

386
00:34:46,039 --> 00:34:50,829
You'll be learning about defensive spells
in a secure. risk-free way.

387
00:34:50,999 --> 00:34:53,638
What use is that?
If we're attacked. it won't be risk-free.

388
00:34:53,799 --> 00:34:56,632
Students will raise their hands
when they speak in my class.

389
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:02,428
It is the view of the Ministry...

390
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,239
...that a theoretical knowledge
will be sufficient...

391
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,277
...to get you through
your examinations...

392
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,795
...which. after all.
is what school is all about.

393
00:35:09,959 --> 00:35:12,632
And how's theory supposed
to prepare us for what's out there?

394
00:35:12,799 --> 00:35:14,755
There is nothing out there. dear.

395
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,798
Who do you imagine
wants to attack children like yourself?

396
00:35:17,959 --> 00:35:21,110
Oh. I don't know.
Maybe Lord Voldemort.

397
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:35,672
Now. let me make this quite plain.

398
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:37,598
You have been told...

399
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,914
...that a certain dark wizard
is at large once again.

400
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:47,994
-This is a lie.
-|t's not a lie. I saw him. I fought him.

401
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,718
Detention. Mr. Potter.

402
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,950
Cedric Diggory dropped dead
of his own accord?

403
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,429
Cedric Diggory's death
was a tragic accident.

404
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,670
It was murder. Voldemort killed him.

405
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:58,272
Enough!

406
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,512
Enough.

407
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:04,832
See me later. Mr. Potter. My office.

408
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,709
Come in.

409
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:36,590
Good evening. Mr. Potter.

410
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:38,427
Sit.

411
00:36:45,799 --> 00:36:49,553
You're going to be doing some lines
for me today. Mr. Potter.

412
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:51,516
No. not with your quill.

413
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:54,791
Going to be using
a rather special one of mine.

414
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:01,072
Now...

415
00:37:01,999 --> 00:37:07,631
...I want you to write.
“I must not tell lies.“

416
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,437
How many times?

417
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:16,351
Well. let's say for as long as it takes
for the message to sink in.

418
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:19,872
You haven't given me any ink.

419
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:21,472
Oh. you won't need any ink.

420
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,033
Yes?

421
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:22,311
-Nothing.
-That's right.

422
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:26,987
Because you know. deep down...

423
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,151
...you deserve to be punished.

424
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,350
Don't you. Mr. Potter?

425
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,958
Go on.

426
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,795
-Skiving Snackboxes.
-Sweets that make you ill.

427
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,518
Get out of class whenever you like.

428
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:54,275
Obtain hours of pleasure
from unprofitable boredom.

429
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,514
Care for another?

430
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,114
-|'m not asking you to write all of it.
-P|ease.

431
00:38:59,279 --> 00:39:02,112
I've been busy studying
for these stupid OWL exams.

432
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:04,317
I'll do the introduction. That's all.

433
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,075
Hermione. you're honestly the most
wonderful person I've ever met.

434
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:12,312
-And if I'm ever rude to you again....
-|'|| know you've gone back to normal.

435
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,151
What's wrong with your hand?

436
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,079
Nothing.

437
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,111
The other hand.

438
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:28,271
-You've got to tell Dumbledore.
-No.

439
00:39:28,439 --> 00:39:30,555
Dumbledore's got enough
on his mind right now.

440
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:32,755
I don't want to give
Umbridge the satisfaction.

441
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,229
Bloody hell. Harry.
The woman's torturing you.

442
00:39:35,399 --> 00:39:39,187
-If the parents knew about this....
-I haven't got any of those. have I. Ron?

443
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,235
Harry. you've got to report this.

444
00:39:44,399 --> 00:39:47,789
-|t's perfectly simple. You're being--
-No. it's not.

445
00:39:47,959 --> 00:39:50,678
Hermione. whatever this is.
it's not simple.

446
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,636
You don't understand.

447
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:57,950
Then help us to.

448
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,877
Dear Padloot...

449
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,038
...I hope you're all right.

450
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:20,636
It's starting to get colder here.
Winter is definitely on the way.

451
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:27,711
In spite of being back at Hogwarts,
I feel more alone than ever.

452
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,717
I know you, of all people,
will understand.

453
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,516
Hello. Harry Potter.

454
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,477
-Your feet. Aren't they cold?
-Bit.

455
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:18,239
Unfortunately. all my shoes
have mysteriously disappeared.

456
00:41:18,759 --> 00:41:21,717
I suspect Nargles are behind it.

457
00:41:27,799 --> 00:41:31,269
-What are they?
-They're called Thestrals.

458
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,789
They're quite gentle. really. but people
avoid them because they're a bit....

459
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,158
Different.

460
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,435
But why can't the others see them?

461
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,956
They can only be seen
by people who've seen death.

462
00:41:51,999 --> 00:41:54,513
So you've known someone
who's died. then?

463
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,238
My mum.

464
00:41:56,759 --> 00:42:01,469
She was quite an extraordinary witch.
but she did like to experiment...

465
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,791
...and one day.
one of her spells went badly wrong.

466
00:42:04,959 --> 00:42:07,234
-I was 9.
-|'m sorry.

467
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,916
Yes. it was rather horrible.

468
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:15,199
I do feel very sad about it sometimes.
but I've got Dad.

469
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,880
We both believe you. by the way.

470
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,678
That He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
is back. and you fought him...

471
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,832
...and the Ministry and the Prophet
are conspiring against you.

472
00:42:28,999 --> 00:42:33,151
Thanks. It seems you're about
the only ones that do.

473
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,594
I don't think that's true.

474
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,872
But I suppose
that's how he wants you to feel.

475
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:41,757
What do you mean?

476
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,157
Well. if I were You-Know-Who...

477
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:48,035
...I'd want you to feel cut off
from everyone else...

478
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:50,793
...because if it's just you alone...

479
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,830
...you're not as much of a threat.

480
00:43:10,759 --> 00:43:15,310
-Do you ever stop eating?
-What? I'm hungry.

481
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:19,548
Harry.

482
00:43:21,319 --> 00:43:22,513
Can I join you?

483
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:27,351
Pardon me. professor.
but what exactly are you insinuating?

484
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:30,158
I am merely requesting
that when it comes to my students...

485
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:34,437
...you conform to the prescribed
disciplinary practices.

486
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,192
So silly of me. but it sounds...

487
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:40,318
...as if you're questioning my authority
in my own classroom...

488
00:43:40,479 --> 00:43:41,753
...Minerva.

489
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:46,198
Not at all. Dolores.
merely your medieval methods.

490
00:43:46,439 --> 00:43:48,828
I am sorry. dear.

491
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,197
But to question my practices
is to question the Ministry...

492
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:55,352
...and by extension.
the minister himself.

493
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:57,032
I am a tolerant woman...

494
00:43:57,199 --> 00:44:02,068
...but the one thing
I will not stand for is disloyalty.

495
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,478
Disloyalty.

496
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:10,908
Things at Hogwarts
are far worse than I feared.

497
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:14,435
Cornelius will want
to take immediate action.

498
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,191
What's happened to Dumbledore?

499
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,793
Having already revolutionized. . .

500
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:32,519
the teaching
of Defense Against the Dark Arts...

501
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:37,476
. . . Dolores Umbridge will,
as high inquisitor, have powers...

502
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:43,873
...to address the seriously falling
standards at Hogwarts School.

503
00:44:51,319 --> 00:44:53,389
Just one question. dear.

504
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:57,599
You've been in this post
how long. exactly?

505
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:08,989
You applied first for the Defense Against
the Dark Arts post. is that correct?

506
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,071
Yes.

507
00:45:11,479 --> 00:45:13,993
But you were unsuccessful?

508
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,469
Obviously.

509
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:51,795
Could you please predict something
for me?

510
00:45:53,479 --> 00:45:54,594
I'm
s
o
rry?

511
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,756
Move those mouths.

512
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,598
One teensy little prophecy?

513
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,639
Pity.

514
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,469
No. wait. Wait. no.
I think I do see something.

515
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,756
Yes. I do. Something dark.

516
00:46:22,999 --> 00:46:27,356
You are in grave danger.

517
00:46:28,759 --> 00:46:30,431
Lovely.

518
00:46:40,199 --> 00:46:42,269
Cho. What's going on?

519
00:46:42,439 --> 00:46:44,669
It's Professor Trelawney.

520
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,636
Sixteen years I've lived
and taught here.

521
00:47:16,799 --> 00:47:19,597
Hogwarts is my home.

522
00:47:21,439 --> 00:47:23,236
You can't do this.

523
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,790
Actually. I can.

524
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:36,638
Something you'd like to say?

525
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,360
Oh. there are several things
I would like to say.

526
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,393
There....

527
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:59,231
Professor McGonagall. might I ask you
to escort Sybil back inside?

528
00:48:00,479 --> 00:48:02,834
Sybil. dear. This way.

529
00:48:02,999 --> 00:48:04,432
Thank you.

530
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:09,439
Dumbledore. may I remind you
that under the terms...

531
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:12,716
...of Educational Decree Number 23.
as enacted by the minister--

532
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,917
You have the right
to dismiss my teachers.

533
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:19,516
You do not. however. have the authority
to banish them from the grounds.

534
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:22,592
That power remains
with the headmaster.

535
00:48:24,519 --> 00:48:25,713
For now.

536
00:48:31,879 --> 00:48:33,790
Don't you all have studying to do?

537
00:48:33,959 --> 00:48:35,074
Professor.

538
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:37,909
Professor?

539
00:48:38,359 --> 00:48:41,032
Professor Dumbledore. Professor!

540
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:43,235
Professor Dumbledore.

541
00:48:53,479 --> 00:48:55,515
That foul, evil, old gargoyle.

542
00:48:56,039 --> 00:48:58,109
We're not learning
how to defend ourselves.

543
00:48:58,279 --> 00:49:00,839
We're not learning
how to pass our OWLs.

544
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:03,155
She's taking over the entire school.

545
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:07,791
Security has been and will remain
the Ministry 's top priority.

546
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:10,679
Furthermore,
we have convincing evidence...

547
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,593
...that these disappearances
are the work...

548
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,991
...of notorious
mass murderer Sirius Black.

549
00:49:17,719 --> 00:49:19,232
Harry.

550
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,078
Sirius.

551
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:24,360
-What are you doing here?
-Answering your letter.

552
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:27,318
You said you were worried
about Umbridge. What's she doing?

553
00:49:27,479 --> 00:49:29,310
Training you to kill half-breeds?

554
00:49:29,479 --> 00:49:32,357
-She's not letting us use magic at all.
-Well. I'm not surprised.

555
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:36,559
The latest intelligence is that Fudge
doesn't want you trained in combat.

556
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:37,708
Combat?

557
00:49:38,199 --> 00:49:40,997
What does he think.
we're forming some sort of wizard army?

558
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,479
That's exactly what he thinks.

559
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:46,428
That Dumbledore is assembling
his own forces to take on the Ministry.

560
00:49:46,919 --> 00:49:50,116
He's becoming more paranoid
by the minute.

561
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:53,796
The others wouldn't want me
telling you this. Harry...

562
00:49:54,279 --> 00:49:56,998
...but things aren't going at all well
with the Order.

563
00:49:57,159 --> 00:49:59,719
Fudge is blocking the truth
at every turn...

564
00:49:59,879 --> 00:50:03,713
...and these disappearances
are just how it started before.

565
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,677
Voldemort is on the move.

566
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,393
Well. what can we do?

567
00:50:09,959 --> 00:50:11,358
Someone's coming.

568
00:50:11,519 --> 00:50:13,635
I'm sorry I can't be of more help.

569
00:50:13,799 --> 00:50:18,589
But for now. at least.
it looks like you're on your own.

570
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,870
He really is out there. isn't he?

571
00:50:33,639 --> 00:50:36,199
We've got to be able
to defend ourselves.

572
00:50:36,759 --> 00:50:40,354
And if Umbridge refuses to teach us
how. we need someone who will.

573
00:50:56,679 --> 00:50:58,749
Harry.

574
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:10,235
This is mad.
Who'd wanna be taught by me?

575
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,549
I'm a nutter. remember?

576
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:16,032
Look on the bright side: you can't be
any worse than old toad face.

577
00:51:16,279 --> 00:51:19,589
-Thanks. Ron.
-|'m here for you. mate.

578
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,310
Who's supposed to be meeting us. then?

579
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,516
Just a couple of people.

580
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:30,718
Lovely spot.

581
00:51:34,279 --> 00:51:36,315
Thought it would be safer
off the beaten track.

582
00:51:36,479 --> 00:51:38,549
Matey. come back here.

583
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,755
Hi.

584
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,913
So you all know why we're here.

585
00:51:51,079 --> 00:51:52,273
We need a teacher.

586
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,990
A proper teacher.

587
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:59,316
One who's had experience defending
themselves against the Dark Arts.

588
00:51:59,479 --> 00:52:01,151
-Why?
-Why?

589
00:52:01,319 --> 00:52:03,310
Because You-Know-Who's back.
you tosspot.

590
00:52:03,479 --> 00:52:04,992
-So he says.
-So Dumbledore says.

591
00:52:05,159 --> 00:52:07,195
So Dumbledore says because he says.

592
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,635
The point is. where's the proof?

593
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:13,872
If Potter could tell us more
about how Diggory got killed....

594
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:20,468
I'm not gonna talk about Cedric. so if
that's why you're here. clear out now.

595
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:23,915
Come on. Hermione. They're here
because they think I'm some freak.

596
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,594
Is it true you can produce
a Patronus Charm?

597
00:52:29,799 --> 00:52:31,152
Yes.

598
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:33,959
I've seen it.

599
00:52:34,119 --> 00:52:36,155
Blimey. Harry.
I didn't know you could do that.

600
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,759
And he killed a basilisk. with the sword
in Dumbledore's office.

601
00:52:40,919 --> 00:52:42,113
It's true.

602
00:52:42,279 --> 00:52:44,918
Third year. he fought off
about a hundred Dementors at once.

603
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,833
Last year. he really did fight off
You-Know-Who in the flesh.

604
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,274
Wait.

605
00:52:50,919 --> 00:52:55,276
Look. it all sounds great
when you say it like that...

606
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,876
...but the truth is.
most of that was just luck.

607
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:02,715
I didn't know what I was doing
half the time. I nearly always had help.

608
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:06,235
-He's just being modest.
-No. Hermione. I'm not.

609
00:53:08,679 --> 00:53:13,150
Facing this stuff in real life
is not like school.

610
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:17,470
In school. if you make a mistake.
you can just try again tomorrow.

611
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,073
But out there...

612
00:53:19,639 --> 00:53:22,790
...when you're a second away
from being murdered...

613
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,509
...or watching a friend die
right before your eyes....

614
00:53:29,159 --> 00:53:30,911
You don't know what that's like.

615
00:53:40,279 --> 00:53:42,110
You're right. Harry. we don't.

616
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,831
That's why we need your help.

617
00:53:44,999 --> 00:53:47,797
Because if we're going to have
any chance at beating...

618
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,035
...Voldemort. . ..

619
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:55,992
He's really back.

620
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:18,993
Right. First we need to find
a place to practice...

621
00:54:19,159 --> 00:54:20,512
...where Umbridge won't find out.

622
00:54:20,679 --> 00:54:22,749
-The Shrieking Shack.
-|t's too small.

623
00:54:22,919 --> 00:54:25,752
-Forbidden Forest?
-Not bloody likely.

624
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,911
Harry. what happens
if Umbridge does find out?

625
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:29,195
Who cares?

626
00:54:29,799 --> 00:54:34,429
I mean. it's sort of exciting. isn't it.
breaking the rules?

627
00:54:34,599 --> 00:54:36,794
Who are you and what have you done
with Hermione?

628
00:54:37,479 --> 00:54:40,994
Anyway. at least we know
one positive thing that came from today.

629
00:54:41,159 --> 00:54:42,387
What's that?

630
00:54:44,039 --> 00:54:46,599
Cho couldn't take her eyes off you.
could she?

631
00:54:49,239 --> 00:54:52,197
Right. Over the next few days.
we should each come up...

632
00:54:52,359 --> 00:54:55,078
...with a couple of possibilities
of places we can practice.

633
00:54:55,239 --> 00:54:58,914
We've got to make sure. wherever it is.
there's no chance she can find us.

634
00:54:59,079 --> 00:55:00,831
Will do. Harry.

635
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:13,159
All student organizations
are henceforth disbanded.

636
00:55:13,319 --> 00:55:16,789
Any student in noncompliance
will be expelled.

637
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,355
Watch where you're going.
Longbottom.

638
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,673
You've done it, Neville.
You found the Room of Requirement.

639
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:58,909
The what?

640
00:55:59,079 --> 00:56:01,388
It's also known as
the Come and Go Room.

641
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:04,835
The Room of Requirement only appears
when a person has real need of it.

642
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,560
And it's always equipped
for the seeker's needs.

643
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:11,315
So say you really needed the toilet....

644
00:56:12,439 --> 00:56:17,069
Charming. Ronald.
But. yes. that is the general idea.

645
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:21,916
It's brilliant. It's like Hogwarts
wants us to fight back.

646
00:56:32,519 --> 00:56:33,952
Exp elliarm us .

647
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,199
I'm hopeless.

648
00:56:40,359 --> 00:56:43,988
You're just flourishing your wand
too much. Try it like this. Expelliarmus.

649
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:51,074
You will please copy
the approved text four times...

650
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:54,118
...to ensure maximum retention.

651
00:56:54,479 --> 00:56:58,028
-There will be no need to talk.
-No need to think's more like it.

652
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,156
-Exp elliarm us.
-Wands away.

653
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:15,518
Stunning is one of the most useful spells
in your arsenal.

654
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,796
It's a wizard's bread and butter. really.

655
00:57:17,959 --> 00:57:21,395
So come on. then. Nigel.
Give it your best shot.

656
00:57:27,639 --> 00:57:28,992
Stupefy!

657
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:37,958
Good. Not bad at all. Nigel. Well done.

658
00:57:43,079 --> 00:57:45,115
Don't worry. I'll go easy on you.

659
00:57:45,479 --> 00:57:47,390
Thanks. Ronald.

660
00:57:49,959 --> 00:57:52,029
-Come on. Ron.
-Come on. Ron.

661
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,953
-You can do it.
-Come on. Ron.

662
00:57:55,479 --> 00:57:57,435
-One Sickle.
-You're on.

663
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,474
Stupefy.

664
00:58:10,919 --> 00:58:12,830
-Thank you.
-Shut up.

665
00:58:13,199 --> 00:58:17,636
I let her do that.
It's good manners. isn't it?

666
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,194
It was completely intentional.

667
00:58:46,759 --> 00:58:49,592
Up you come.
Would you like a cup of tea?

668
00:58:51,799 --> 00:58:55,587
Now. focus on a fixed point
and try again.

669
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,037
Exp elliarm us .

670
00:58:59,559 --> 00:59:01,993
Very good. Keep your concentration.

671
00:59:04,039 --> 00:59:05,472
Great.

672
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:08,193
A little higher.

673
00:59:16,359 --> 00:59:19,078
I'm okay. I'm okay.

674
00:59:36,359 --> 00:59:38,873
-Stupefy.
-Stupefy.

675
00:59:40,359 --> 00:59:43,590
Those wishing to join
the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...

676
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,513
...may sign up
in the high inquisitor's office.

677
00:59:46,679 --> 00:59:48,237
Diminuendo.

678
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:58,038
Working hard is important. but there's
something that matters even more:

679
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,316
Believing in yourself.

680
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,516
-Exp elliarm us.
-l.evicorpus. Got it.

681
01:00:02,679 --> 01:00:04,192
Think of it this way.

682
01:00:04,359 --> 01:00:08,193
Every great wizard in history
has started out...

683
01:00:08,519 --> 01:00:12,228
...as nothing more
than what we are now: students.

684
01:00:12,399 --> 01:00:15,232
If they can do it. why not us?

685
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,678
-Stupefy.
-Exp elliarm us .

686
01:00:28,759 --> 01:00:30,078
Exp elliarm us .

687
01:00:32,679 --> 01:00:34,112
Exp elliarm us .

688
01:00:39,399 --> 01:00:40,673
Reducto.

689
01:00:53,639 --> 01:00:56,517
-Exp elliarm us .
-Exp elliarm us .

690
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:58,910
Exp elliarm us .

691
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:04,671
Exp elliarm us .

692
01:01:08,359 --> 01:01:11,590
Fantastic. Neville. Well done. man.

693
01:01:13,159 --> 01:01:15,229
So that's it for this lesson.

694
01:01:15,399 --> 01:01:18,630
Now. we're not gonna be meeting again
until after the holidays.

695
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,952
So just keep practicing on your own
as best you can.

696
01:01:22,119 --> 01:01:25,316
And well done. everyone.
Great. great work.

697
01:01:29,959 --> 01:01:31,312
Well done. mate.

698
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:32,833
Thanks.

699
01:01:38,279 --> 01:01:40,554
See you after Christmas.

700
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:51,596
See you in the Common Room. Harry.

701
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:55,554
-Thanks a lot. Harry.
-No worries.

702
01:01:57,239 --> 01:01:59,514
-Thank you so much.
-Not at all. Merry Christmas.

703
01:01:59,959 --> 01:02:02,234
-Thank you. Harry.
-Thank you. Merry Christmas.

704
01:02:02,399 --> 01:02:04,196
-Merry Christmas.
-Have a good Christmas.

705
01:02:04,359 --> 01:02:06,827
-Have a great Christmas. Luna.
-We've been thinking.

706
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,309
We could always slip Umbridge
some Puking Pastilles.

707
01:02:09,479 --> 01:02:12,039
Or Fever Fudge. They give you
massive. pus-filled boils--

708
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:14,589
Sounds great. guys.
Would you excuse me?

709
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:29,636
Are you all right? I heard Umbridge
gave you a rough time the other day.

710
01:02:29,799 --> 01:02:32,074
Yeah. I'm okay.

711
01:02:32,759 --> 01:02:35,432
Anyway. it's worth it.

712
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:43,596
It's just. learning all this...

713
01:02:44,359 --> 01:02:47,669
...makes me wonder whether.
if he'd known it....

714
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:50,434
Cedric did know this stuff.

715
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,309
He was really good.

716
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:56,514
It's just. Voldemort was better.

717
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,598
You're a really good teacher. Harry.

718
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:06,593
I've never been able
to stun anything before.

719
01:03:15,399 --> 01:03:16,991
Mistletoe.

720
01:03:20,359 --> 01:03:22,190
Probably full of Nargles. though.

721
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:24,832
What are Nargles?

722
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,192
No idea.

723
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:50,436
Well, how was it?

724
01:03:51,159 --> 01:03:52,831
Wet.

725
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:54,912
I mean. she was sort of crying.

726
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,157
That bad at it. are you?

727
01:03:57,319 --> 01:03:59,958
I'm sure Harry's kissing
was more than satisfactory.

728
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:04,750
Cho spends half her time
crying these days.

729
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:07,070
You'd think a bit of snogging
would cheer her up.

730
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:11,239
Don't you understand
how she must be feeling?

731
01:04:15,479 --> 01:04:18,789
Well. obviously
she's feeling sad about Cedric...

732
01:04:18,959 --> 01:04:21,917
...and confused about liking Harry
and guilty about kissing him...

733
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:25,152
...conflicted because Umbridge might
sack her mum from the Ministry...

734
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:28,914
...and frightened of failing her OWLs
because she's worrying about everything.

735
01:04:30,759 --> 01:04:34,195
One person couldn't feel all that.
They'd explode.

736
01:04:34,359 --> 01:04:37,476
Just because you've got
the emotional range of a teaspoon....

737
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:54,239
Harry.

738
01:05:02,639 --> 01:05:05,597
Voldemort may be after something.

739
01:05:06,239 --> 01:05:09,117
Something he didn't have last time.

740
01:05:09,919 --> 01:05:11,113
Harry.

741
01:05:12,679 --> 01:05:13,907
Harry.

742
01:05:43,719 --> 01:05:46,995
In the dream.
were you standing next to the victim...

743
01:05:47,159 --> 01:05:48,592
...or looking down at the scene?

744
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:51,873
Neither. It was like I....

745
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:54,431
Will you please just tell me
what's happening?

746
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:56,830
Everard. Arthur's on guard duty
tonight.

747
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,309
Make sure he's found
by the right people.

748
01:05:59,479 --> 01:06:00,992
-Sir.
-Phineas.

749
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:03,355
You must go to your portrait
at Grimmauld Place.

750
01:06:03,519 --> 01:06:06,033
Tell them that Arthur Weasley
is gravely injured...

751
01:06:06,199 --> 01:06:10,192
...and his children will be arriving there
soon by Portkey.

752
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:13,318
They've got him. Albus. It was close.
but they think he'll make it.

753
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:15,869
What's more.
the Dark Lord failed to acquire it.

754
01:06:16,039 --> 01:06:17,870
Oh. thank goodness. Next we need to--

755
01:06:18,039 --> 01:06:19,188
Look at me!

756
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,556
What's happening to me?

757
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:36,916
You wished to see me. headmaster?

758
01:06:37,079 --> 01:06:41,789
Oh. Severus. I'm afraid we can't wait.
Not even till the morning.

759
01:06:42,159 --> 01:06:44,957
Otherwise. we'll all be vulnerable.

760
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,078
It appears there's a connection...

761
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,470
...between the Dark Lord's mind
and your own.

762
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:57,633
Whether he is. as yet. aware of this
connection is. for the moment. unclear.

763
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:00,872
Pray he remains ignorant.

764
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:04,191
You mean. if he knows about it. then...

765
01:07:04,639 --> 01:07:08,837
-...he'll be able to read my mind?
-Read it. control it...

766
01:07:08,999 --> 01:07:10,796
...unhinge it.

767
01:07:10,959 --> 01:07:14,190
In the past. it was often
the Dark Lord's pleasure...

768
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:16,510
...to invade the minds of his victims...

769
01:07:16,679 --> 01:07:20,115
...creating visions designed
to torture them into madness.

770
01:07:21,199 --> 01:07:25,795
Only after extracting the last exquisite
ounce of agony...

771
01:07:25,959 --> 01:07:30,077
...only when he had them literally
begging for death. would he finally...

772
01:07:30,239 --> 01:07:31,388
...kill them.

773
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:34,669
Used properly.
the power of Occlumency...

774
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:38,196
...will help shield you
from access or influence.

775
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:42,911
In these lessons. I will attempt
to penetrate your mind.

776
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:46,438
You will attempt to resist.

777
01:07:46,719 --> 01:07:48,118
Prepare yourself.

778
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:51,909
l.egilimens.

779
01:07:59,719 --> 01:08:03,155
Concentrate. Potter. Focus.

780
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,558
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.

781
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:33,280
Here we go.

782
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:35,509
Daddy's back.

783
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:42,030
Sit down. everybody. sit down.
That's it. Now. presents.

784
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:46,398
-And a nice big box for Ron.
-Big box for you. And....

785
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:51,196
Fred and George. Come on. open up.

786
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:53,555
-I want to see your faces.
-Yes.

787
01:08:53,719 --> 01:08:56,028
-Try it on.
-Thanks. Mum. It's perfect.

788
01:08:56,199 --> 01:09:00,317
-Just what he wanted. actually.
-Yeah. Right. Thanks. Mum.

789
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:03,233
Come on. then. everybody.
Let's clear this away.

790
01:09:03,399 --> 01:09:05,310
Oh. Harry. Harry.

791
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:07,311
There you are.

792
01:09:08,279 --> 01:09:10,031
-Happy Christmas.
-Thank you.

793
01:09:10,599 --> 01:09:12,351
-Love|y to have you with us.
-Thank you.

794
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:14,431
Now. Daddy. Pass that to Daddy.

795
01:09:14,599 --> 01:09:16,237
-Thank you.
-Has everybody got?

796
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:17,718
Fred? George?

797
01:09:17,879 --> 01:09:20,313
-Hermione.
-A Christmas toast.

798
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:22,276
To Mr. Harry Potter...

799
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:25,959
...without whom I would not be here.

800
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:31,629
-Harry.
-Harry.

801
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:32,994
Harry.

802
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:36,428
That is delicious.
I shall be needing some more of that.

803
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,875
Daddy. don't forget last Christmas.

804
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:42,399
I can't understand
why you don't want to wear it. Ronald.

805
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:45,552
I look like a bloody idiot. that's why.

806
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:47,472
No more than usual. Ron.

807
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:49,432
I don't know why....

808
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:59,591
Nasty brat. standing there
as bold as brass.

809
01:09:59,759 --> 01:10:04,310
Harry Potter.
the boy who stopped the Dark Lord.

810
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:07,358
Friend of Mudbloods
and blood-traitors alike.

811
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:10,274
-If my poor mistress only knew....
-Kreacher!

812
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:13,158
That's enough of your bile.
Away with you!

813
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:15,231
Of course. master.

814
01:10:15,399 --> 01:10:19,870
Kreacher lives to serve
the noble house of Black.

815
01:10:22,119 --> 01:10:23,916
Sorry about that.

816
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:27,995
He never was very pleasant.
even when I was a boy.

817
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,311
Not to me. anyway.

818
01:10:31,119 --> 01:10:32,996
What. you grew up here?

819
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,310
This is my parents' house.

820
01:10:35,639 --> 01:10:39,314
I offered it to Dumbledore
as headquarters for the Order.

821
01:10:40,399 --> 01:10:43,550
About the only useful thing
I've been able to do.

822
01:10:44,879 --> 01:10:47,154
This is the Black family tree.

823
01:10:48,039 --> 01:10:50,075
My deranged cousin.

824
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:52,834
I hated the lot of them.

825
01:10:52,999 --> 01:10:57,515
My parents with their pure-blood mania.

826
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:04,229
My mother did that after I ran away.

827
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:08,277
Charming woman.

828
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:11,072
I was 16.

829
01:11:11,879 --> 01:11:13,232
Where did you go?

830
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:16,434
Round your dad's.

831
01:11:17,879 --> 01:11:20,313
I was always welcome at the Potters'.

832
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:23,799
I see him so much in you. Harry.

833
01:11:24,399 --> 01:11:26,515
You are so very much alike.

834
01:11:27,399 --> 01:11:29,310
I'm not so sure.

835
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,719
Sirius. when I was....

836
01:11:34,439 --> 01:11:38,751
When I saw Mr. Weasley attacked.
I wasn't just watching.

837
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:41,313
I was the snake.

838
01:11:42,119 --> 01:11:44,952
And afterwards.
in Dumbledore's office...

839
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:49,159
...there was a moment
when I wanted to--

840
01:11:54,079 --> 01:11:56,832
This connection
between me and Voldemort.

841
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:00,916
What if the reason for it
is that I am becoming more like him?

842
01:12:02,199 --> 01:12:06,909
I just feel so angry all the time.

843
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:11,437
And what if. after everything
that I've been through...

844
01:12:11,599 --> 01:12:15,035
...something's gone wrong inside me?
What if I'm becoming bad?

845
01:12:17,559 --> 01:12:20,676
I want you to listen to me
very carefully. Harry.

846
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:24,678
You're not a bad person.

847
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:29,632
You're a very good person
who bad things have happened to.

848
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:31,309
You understand?

849
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:38,155
Besides. the world isn't split
into good people and Death Eaters.

850
01:12:38,319 --> 01:12:42,597
We've all got both light and dark
inside of us.

851
01:12:43,319 --> 01:12:46,436
What matters
is the part we choose to act on.

852
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,515
That's who we really are.

853
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:55,792
Harry. time to go.

854
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:01,598
When all this is over.
we'll be a proper family.

855
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:03,273
You'll see.

856
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:05,679
Come on.

857
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:42,715
ReaHy?

858
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:45,394
Harry. Harry.

859
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:47,391
Hagrid's back.

860
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:51,992
I'm sorry.

861
01:14:05,639 --> 01:14:08,676
I will say this one last time.

862
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:11,235
I'm ordering you to tell me
where you've been.

863
01:14:11,399 --> 01:14:14,277
I told you. I've been away
for me health.

864
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:18,593
-Your health?
-Yeah. Bit of fresh air. you know.

865
01:14:18,759 --> 01:14:23,389
Oh. yes. As gamekeeper.
fresh air must be difficult to come by.

866
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:27,749
If I were you.
I shouldn't get too used to being back.

867
01:14:27,919 --> 01:14:31,070
In fact. I mightn't bother
unpacking at all.

868
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:52,198
This is top-secret. right?

869
01:14:53,079 --> 01:14:55,354
Dumbledore sent me
to parley with the giants.

870
01:14:55,519 --> 01:14:56,952
Giants?

871
01:14:58,120 --> 01:14:59,109
You found them?

872
01:14:59,279 --> 01:15:02,988
Well, they're not that hard to find. to be
perfectly honest. They're so big. see?

873
01:15:03,839 --> 01:15:06,751
I tried to convince them
to join the cause.

874
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:09,479
But I wasn't the only one
that was trying to win them over.

875
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:11,991
-Death Eaters?
-Yes.

876
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:15,637
Trying to persuade them
to join You-Know-Who.

877
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:18,395
-Did they?
-I gave them Dumbledore's message.

878
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:22,473
Suppose some of them remember
he was friendly to them. I suppose.

879
01:15:25,959 --> 01:15:27,187
And they did this to you?

880
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:29,552
Not exactly. no.

881
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:33,794
Oh, go on, you have it, then,
you dozy dog.

882
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:49,235
It's changing out there.

883
01:15:49,639 --> 01:15:51,152
Just like last time.

884
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:54,118
There's a storm coming. Harry.

885
01:15:54,839 --> 01:15:57,797
We'd all best be ready when she does.

886
01:16:33,279 --> 01:16:36,191
We have confirmed
that 10 high-security prisoners...

887
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:39,079
...in the early hours of yesterday evening
did escape.

888
01:16:39,239 --> 01:16:42,754
And of course, the Muggle prime minister
has been alerted to the danger.

889
01:16:42,919 --> 01:16:44,910
We strongly suspect. . .

890
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:47,631
...that the breakout was engineered...

891
01:16:47,799 --> 01:16:51,838
...by a man with personal experience
in escaping from Azkaban...

892
01:16:51,999 --> 01:16:56,038
...notorious mass murderer Sirius Black...

893
01:16:57,440 --> 01:17:01,638
...cousin of escapee
Bella trix Les trange.

894
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:13,715
Dumbledore warned Fudge
this could happen.

895
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:16,917
He's gonna get us all killed
just because he can't face the truth.

896
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:18,149
Harry.

897
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:23,631
I wanted to apologize.

898
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:28,193
Now even me mum says the Prophet's
version of things don't add up.

899
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:34,037
So. what I'm really trying to say
is that I believe you.

900
01:17:40,679 --> 01:17:42,237
Neville?

901
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:56,350
Fourteen years ago...

902
01:17:56,520 --> 01:18:00,593
...a Death Eater
named Bellatrix Lestrange...

903
01:18:00,759 --> 01:18:03,831
...used a Cruciatus Curse
on my parents.

904
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:08,194
She tortured them for information...

905
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:10,430
...but they never gave in.

906
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:14,429
I'm quite proud to be their son.

907
01:18:15,360 --> 01:18:19,069
But I'm not sure I'm ready
for everyone to know just yet.

908
01:18:24,759 --> 01:18:28,718
We're gonna make them proud. Neville.
That's a promise.

909
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:36,349
Make it a powerful memory.
the happiest you can remember.

910
01:18:36,519 --> 01:18:39,795
Allow it to fill you up.
Keep trying. Seamus.

911
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:41,313
George. your turn now.

912
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:44,830
Expecto Patronum.

913
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:48,996
A full-bodied Patronus
is the most difficult to produce...

914
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:52,835
...but shield forms can also be equally
useful against a variety of opponents.

915
01:18:52,999 --> 01:18:54,193
Wow. that was really good.

916
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,359
Fantastic. Ginny.

917
01:18:56,520 --> 01:19:00,399
Just remember. your Patronus can only
protect you for as long as you stay focused.

918
01:19:00,559 --> 01:19:02,754
So focus. Luna.

919
01:19:06,319 --> 01:19:07,957
Think of the happiest thing you can.

920
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:09,996
Expecto Patronum.

921
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:12,913
-|'m trying.
-I know. It's good.

922
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:17,153
This is really advanced stuff. guys.
You're doing so well.

923
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:20,189
Expecto Patronum.

924
01:20:00,319 --> 01:20:02,753
I'll make short work of this.

925
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:05,951
Bombarda Maxima.

926
01:20:23,480 --> 01:20:24,799
Get them.

927
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:26,599
Been watching them for weeks.

928
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:28,637
And see. “Dumbledore's Army“...

929
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:32,589
...proof of what I've been telling you
right from the beginning. Cornelius.

930
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:35,876
All your fear-mongering
about You-Know-Who...

931
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:37,519
...never fooled us for a minute.

932
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:39,670
We saw your lies for what they were:

933
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:43,469
A smokescreen for your bid
to seize control of the Ministry.

934
01:20:43,639 --> 01:20:44,628
Naturally.

935
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:47,234
No. professor.
He had nothing to do with it. It was me.

936
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:50,915
Most noble of you. Harry. to shield me.
but as has been pointed out...

937
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:55,710
...the parchment clearly says
“Dumbledore's Army." not “Potter's.“

938
01:20:55,879 --> 01:20:58,393
I instructed Harry
to form this organization.

939
01:20:58,559 --> 01:21:01,869
And I. and I alone.
am responsible for its activities.

940
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:03,792
Dispatch an ow! to the Daily Prophet.

941
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:06,394
If we hurry. we should still make
the morning edition.

942
01:21:06,559 --> 01:21:11,155
Dawlish. Shacklebolt.
you will escort Dumbledore...

943
01:21:11,319 --> 01:21:12,672
...to Azkaban...

944
01:21:13,879 --> 01:21:18,828
...to await trial
for conspiracy and sedition.

945
01:21:18,999 --> 01:21:21,797
I thought we might hit this little snag.

946
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:26,230
You seem to be laboring
under the delusion that I'm going to--

947
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:28,159
What was the phrase?

948
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,833
--come quietly.

949
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,638
Well. I can tell you this:

950
01:21:32,039 --> 01:21:34,269
I have no intention
of going to Azkaban.

951
01:21:34,439 --> 01:21:35,633
Enough of this.

952
01:21:36,120 --> 01:21:37,155
Take him.

953
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:53,678
Well. you may not like him. minister...

954
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,876
...but you can't deny...

955
01:21:56,399 --> 01:21:59,038
...Dumbledore has got style.

956
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:26,591
Boys and girls are not permitted
to be within eight inches of each other.

957
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:30,036
Those wishing to join
the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit....

958
01:22:30,199 --> 01:22:35,034
Students will be submitted to questioning
about suspected illicit activities.

959
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:39,318
Any student in noncompliance
will be expelled.

960
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,158
Harry.

961
01:23:55,799 --> 01:23:59,075
You did everything you could.
No one could win against that old hag.

962
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:01,470
Even Dumbledore
didn't see this coming.

963
01:24:02,360 --> 01:24:04,430
Harry. if it's anyone's fault. it's ours.

964
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:06,591
Yeah. we talked you into it.

965
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:08,671
Yeah. but I agreed.

966
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:13,158
I tried so hard to help.
and all it's done is make things worse.

967
01:24:15,119 --> 01:24:17,474
Anyway. that doesn't matter anymore.

968
01:24:18,479 --> 01:24:22,518
Because I don't want to play anymore.
All it does is make you care too much.

969
01:24:22,680 --> 01:24:25,240
And the more you care.
the more you have to lose.

970
01:24:25,399 --> 01:24:28,436
-So maybe it's just better to....
-To what?

971
01:24:30,599 --> 01:24:32,430
To go it alone.

972
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:40,112
Hagrid.

973
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:46,029
Any idea where he's taking us?

974
01:24:46,199 --> 01:24:49,157
Hagrid. why can't you just tell us?

975
01:24:57,119 --> 01:24:59,679
I've never seen the centaurs so riled.

976
01:24:59,839 --> 01:25:02,273
And they're dangerous
at the best of times.

977
01:25:03,199 --> 01:25:05,429
The Ministry restricts
their territory much more...

978
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,716
...they'll have a full uprising
on their hands.

979
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:09,472
Hagrid. what's going on?

980
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:11,756
I'm sorry to be so mysterious. you three.

981
01:25:11,919 --> 01:25:16,674
I wouldn't be bothering you at all with it.
but with Dumbledore gone...

982
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:20,357
...I'II likely be getting the sack
any day now.

983
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:23,876
And I just couldn't leave
without telling someone about him.

984
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:29,472
Grawpy.

985
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:33,796
Down here. you great buffoon.

986
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:41,472
Grawpy.

987
01:25:42,239 --> 01:25:43,877
Brought you some company.

988
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:57,870
I couldn't just leave him. because--

989
01:25:58,039 --> 01:25:59,711
Because he's my brother.

990
01:25:59,880 --> 01:26:00,949
Blimey.

991
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:03,076
Well. half brother. really.

992
01:26:03,239 --> 01:26:08,267
He's completely harmless. just like I said.
Little high-spirited. is all.

993
01:26:10,319 --> 01:26:12,549
-Grawpy. that is not polite.
-Hagrid. do something.

994
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:15,028
We talked about this.
You do not grab. do you?

995
01:26:15,199 --> 01:26:17,349
That's your new friend. Hermione.

996
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:18,748
Grawpy.

997
01:26:22,919 --> 01:26:24,034
Grawp.

998
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,958
Put me down.

999
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:33,959
Now.

1000
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:46,675
You all right?

1001
01:26:47,919 --> 01:26:49,511
Fine.

1002
01:26:49,919 --> 01:26:52,114
Just needs a firm hand. is all.

1003
01:26:52,279 --> 01:26:54,588
I think you've got an admirer.

1004
01:26:56,999 --> 01:26:59,069
You just stay away from her. all right?

1005
01:27:27,959 --> 01:27:30,598
He gets his own food and all.

1006
01:27:31,799 --> 01:27:34,757
It's company he'll be needing
when I'm gone.

1007
01:27:36,039 --> 01:27:38,155
You will look after him. won't you?

1008
01:27:38,640 --> 01:27:41,234
I'm the only family he's got.

1009
01:27:54,279 --> 01:27:56,031
Feeling sentimental?

1010
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:02,875
-That's private.
-Not to me.

1011
01:28:03,159 --> 01:28:06,515
And not to the Dark Lord.
if you don't improve.

1012
01:28:08,839 --> 01:28:11,876
Every memory he has access to
is a weapon he can use against you.

1013
01:28:12,039 --> 01:28:16,032
You won't last two seconds
if he invades your mind.

1014
01:28:17,159 --> 01:28:19,309
You're just like your father.

1015
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:21,198
Lazy. arrogant.

1016
01:28:21,359 --> 01:28:23,509
-Don't say a word against my father.
-Weak.

1017
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:25,750
-|'m not weak.
-Then prove it.

1018
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:28,191
Control your emotions.

1019
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:31,193
Discipline your mind.

1020
01:28:33,919 --> 01:28:35,068
l.egilimens.

1021
01:28:41,959 --> 01:28:43,028
Harry.

1022
01:28:43,199 --> 01:28:44,837
Sirius.

1023
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:46,754
I may vomit.

1024
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:48,069
Stop it.

1025
01:28:49,159 --> 01:28:51,354
Is this what you call control?

1026
01:28:51,839 --> 01:28:54,751
We've been at it for hours.
If I could just rest.

1027
01:28:54,919 --> 01:28:58,195
The Dark Lord isn't resting.

1028
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:01,591
You and Black. you're two of a kind.

1029
01:29:01,760 --> 01:29:05,548
Sentimental children forever whining
about how unfair your lives have been.

1030
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:08,951
Well, it may have escaped your notice.
but life isn't fair.

1031
01:29:09,119 --> 01:29:12,907
Your blessed father knew that.
In fact. he frequently saw to it.

1032
01:29:13,079 --> 01:29:15,991
-My father was a great man.
-Your father was a swine.

1033
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,433
-L egilimens.
-Pro tego.

1034
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:25,239
Come on. Moony. Padfoot.

1035
01:29:25,399 --> 01:29:27,390
Snape. Expelliarmus.

1036
01:29:27,559 --> 01:29:29,311
Nice one. James.

1037
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:31,870
-Dad.
-Impedimenta.

1038
01:29:32,039 --> 01:29:33,950
Snivellus Greasy.
Snivellus Greasy.

1039
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:36,680
Right. Who wants to see me
take off Snivelly's trousers?

1040
01:29:36,839 --> 01:29:38,989
Snivellus Greasy.
Snivellus Greasy.

1041
01:29:39,159 --> 01:29:40,308
Enough.

1042
01:29:42,199 --> 01:29:43,712
Enough.

1043
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:54,394
Your lessons are at an end.

1044
01:29:54,559 --> 01:29:55,628


1045
01:29:55,799 --> 01:29:58,916
Get out.

1046
01:30:15,439 --> 01:30:17,509
-What's your name?
-Michae|.

1047
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:19,511
Your hand's gonna be fine. Michael.

1048
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:22,592
Yeah. It's not as bad as it seems. See?

1049
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:24,671
It's fading already.

1050
01:30:24,839 --> 01:30:29,390
You can hardly see ours anymore.
and the pain stops after a while.

1051
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:39,074
As I told you once before. Mr. Potter...

1052
01:30:39,239 --> 01:30:42,868
...naughty children
deserve to be punished.

1053
01:30:45,799 --> 01:30:47,073
You know. George...

1054
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:50,755
...I've always felt our futures lay outside
the world of academic achievement.

1055
01:30:50,919 --> 01:30:55,310
Fred. I've been thinking
exactly the same thing.

1056
01:32:04,319 --> 01:32:05,911
All right. professor!

1057
01:32:14,319 --> 01:32:16,037
Here you go.

1058
01:32:39,959 --> 01:32:41,711
Ready when you are.

1059
01:34:03,959 --> 01:34:07,076
I need that prophecy.

1060
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:08,992
You'll have to kill me.

1061
01:34:09,799 --> 01:34:14,190
Oh. I will.
But first. you will fetch it for me.

1062
01:34:14,360 --> 01:34:15,998
Crucio .

1063
01:34:18,439 --> 01:34:20,111
Crucio .

1064
01:34:31,039 --> 01:34:32,438
Sirius.

1065
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:33,589
Harry. are you sure?

1066
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:36,069
I saw it. It's just like
with Mr. Weasley.

1067
01:34:36,239 --> 01:34:38,036
It's the door I've been dreaming about.

1068
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:40,191
I couldn't remember
where I'd seen it before.

1069
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:42,191
Sirius said Voldemort
was after something.

1070
01:34:42,359 --> 01:34:45,510
Something he didn't have the last time.
in the Department of Mysteries.

1071
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:47,556
Harry. please. just listen.

1072
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,911
What if Voldemort
meant for you to see this?

1073
01:34:52,159 --> 01:34:55,151
What if he's only hurting Sirius
because he's trying to get to you?

1074
01:34:55,319 --> 01:34:58,675
What if he is?
I'm supposed to just let him die?

1075
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:02,196
Hermione.
he's the only family I've got left.

1076
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:05,629
What do we do?

1077
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,558
We'll have to use the Floo Network.

1078
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:10,711
Umbridge has the chimneys
under surveillance.

1079
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:12,359
Not all of them.

1080
01:35:15,079 --> 01:35:16,353
Alohomora.

1081
01:35:27,119 --> 01:35:28,757
Alert the Order if you can.

1082
01:35:28,919 --> 01:35:32,355
-Are you mental? We're going with you.
-|t's too dangerous.

1083
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:35,990
When are you going to get it
into your head? We're in this together.

1084
01:35:36,159 --> 01:35:39,231
That you are.

1085
01:35:39,399 --> 01:35:42,152
Caught this one
trying to help the Weasley girl.

1086
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:48,996
You were going to Dumbledore.
weren't you?

1087
01:35:49,159 --> 01:35:51,070
-No.
-Liar.

1088
01:35:51,239 --> 01:35:53,958
-You sent for me. headmistress?
-Snape. yes.

1089
01:35:54,119 --> 01:35:57,475
The time has come for answers. whether
he wants to give them to me or not.

1090
01:35:57,880 --> 01:35:59,359
Have you brought the Veritaserum?

1091
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:02,273
I'm afraid you've used up
all my stores interrogating students.

1092
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:05,477
The last of it on Miss Chang.

1093
01:36:09,359 --> 01:36:10,758
Unless you wish to poison him--

1094
01:36:10,919 --> 01:36:15,197
And I assure you. I would have
the greatest sympathy if you did.

1095
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:17,637
--I cannot help you.

1096
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:21,598
He's got Padfoot.

1097
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:25,956
He's got Padfoot at the place
where it's hidden.

1098
01:36:26,399 --> 01:36:28,435
Padfoot? What is Padfoot?
Where what is hidden?

1099
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:30,079
What is he talking about. Snape?

1100
01:36:36,479 --> 01:36:38,390
No idea.

1101
01:36:42,719 --> 01:36:44,198
Very well.

1102
01:36:45,159 --> 01:36:47,389
You give me no choice. Potter.

1103
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:50,593
As this is an issue
of Ministry security...

1104
01:36:50,760 --> 01:36:52,751
...you leave me with...

1105
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:55,357
...no alternative.

1106
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:58,236
The Cruciatus Curse
ought to loosen your tongue.

1107
01:36:58,399 --> 01:36:59,388
That's illegal.

1108
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:02,757
What Cornelius doesn't know
won't hurt him.

1109
01:37:09,959 --> 01:37:11,392
Tell her. Harry!

1110
01:37:12,839 --> 01:37:14,238
Tell me what?

1111
01:37:15,399 --> 01:37:17,310
Well. if you won't tell her where it is...

1112
01:37:17,959 --> 01:37:19,631
...I will.

1113
01:37:21,199 --> 01:37:22,917
Where what is?

1114
01:37:24,079 --> 01:37:26,274
Dumbledore's secret weapon.

1115
01:37:31,079 --> 01:37:32,558
How much further?

1116
01:37:32,719 --> 01:37:34,311
Not far.

1117
01:37:36,239 --> 01:37:39,788
It had to be somewhere
students wouldn't find it accidentally.

1118
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:45,359
What are you doing?

1119
01:37:45,520 --> 01:37:47,238
Improvising.

1120
01:37:55,399 --> 01:37:56,957
Well?

1121
01:37:58,199 --> 01:38:00,235
Where is this weapon?

1122
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:07,110
There isn't one. is there?

1123
01:38:09,799 --> 01:38:11,869
You were trying to trick me.

1124
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:17,393
You know...

1125
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:20,671
...I really hate children.

1126
01:38:35,639 --> 01:38:39,871
You have no business here. centaur.
This is a Ministry matter.

1127
01:38:42,439 --> 01:38:44,031
Lower your weapons.

1128
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:49,513
I warn you. under the law. as
creatures of near-human intelligence....

1129
01:38:49,679 --> 01:38:50,873
Pro tego.

1130
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:52,189
How dare you?

1131
01:38:52,840 --> 01:38:54,273
Filthy half-breed.

1132
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:55,989
Incarcerous.

1133
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:11,148
Please. Please stop it. Please.

1134
01:39:11,319 --> 01:39:15,790
Now. enough. I will have order.

1135
01:39:24,279 --> 01:39:26,747
You filthy animal.

1136
01:39:26,920 --> 01:39:29,753
Do you know who I am?

1137
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:32,639
Leave him alone. It's not his fault.

1138
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:34,597
No. he doesn't understand.

1139
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:45,270
Potter. do something.
Tell them I mean no harm.

1140
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:47,271
l' m sorry. professor.

1141
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:49,158
But I must not tell lies.

1142
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:50,309
What are you doing?

1143
01:39:50,479 --> 01:39:54,108
I am Senior Undersecretary
Dolores Jane Umbridge.

1144
01:39:54,599 --> 01:39:56,669
Let me go!

1145
01:39:59,239 --> 01:40:00,991
Thank you. Grawp.

1146
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:04,516
Hermione. Hermione. Sirius.

1147
01:40:12,439 --> 01:40:15,875
-How'd you get away?
-Puking Pastilles. It wasn't pretty.

1148
01:40:16,039 --> 01:40:18,075
Told them I was hungry.
wanted some sweets.

1149
01:40:18,239 --> 01:40:20,673
They told me to bugger off
and ate the lot themselves.

1150
01:40:21,479 --> 01:40:22,912
That was clever. Ron.

1151
01:40:23,720 --> 01:40:26,109
-Has been known to happen.
-It was brilliant.

1152
01:40:26,279 --> 01:40:28,031
So how are we getting to London?

1153
01:40:29,319 --> 01:40:32,709
Look. it's not that I don't appreciate
everything you've done. all of you...

1154
01:40:33,519 --> 01:40:36,113
...but I've got you
into enough trouble as it is.

1155
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:39,113
Dumbledore's Army's supposed to be
about doing something real.

1156
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:41,476
Or was that all just words to you?

1157
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:46,352
Maybe you don't have to do this
all by yourself. mate.

1158
01:40:51,080 --> 01:40:53,150
So how are we going to get to London?

1159
01:40:54,479 --> 01:40:56,629
We fly. of course.

1160
01:41:45,599 --> 01:41:47,669
Department of Mysteries.

1161
01:41:56,160 --> 01:41:57,798
This is it.

1162
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:50,830
Ninety-two. Ninety-three.

1163
01:42:52,479 --> 01:42:53,798
Ninety-four.

1164
01:42:54,999 --> 01:42:55,988
Ninety-five.

1165
01:43:08,039 --> 01:43:10,678
-He should be here.
-Harry.

1166
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:14,508
It's got your name on it.

1167
01:43:38,679 --> 01:43:42,877
The one with the power
to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches.

1168
01:43:43,680 --> 01:43:45,989
And the Dark Lord
shall mark him as his equal...

1169
01:43:46,159 --> 01:43:48,832
...but he shall have power
the Dark Lord knows not.

1170
01:43:54,279 --> 01:43:59,399
For neither can live
while the other survives.

1171
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:02,869
Harry.

1172
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:14,353
Where's Sirius?

1173
01:44:14,519 --> 01:44:19,388
You know. you really should learn
to tell the difference between dreams...

1174
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:24,270
...and reality.

1175
01:44:25,480 --> 01:44:30,235
You saw only what the Dark Lord
wanted you to see.

1176
01:44:30,920 --> 01:44:32,353
Now. hand me the prophecy.

1177
01:44:32,520 --> 01:44:34,511
If you do anything to us. I'll break it.

1178
01:44:37,159 --> 01:44:39,627
He knows how to play.

1179
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:43,429
Itty. bitty baby.

1180
01:44:43,599 --> 01:44:44,793
Potter.

1181
01:44:45,320 --> 01:44:47,117
Bellatrix Lestrange.

1182
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:50,113
Neville Longbottom. is it?
How's Mum and Dad?

1183
01:44:50,280 --> 01:44:52,032
Better. now they're
about to be avenged.

1184
01:44:54,760 --> 01:44:59,390
Now. let's everybody
just calm down...

1185
01:44:59,839 --> 01:45:01,272
...shall we?

1186
01:45:01,439 --> 01:45:03,794
All we want is that prophecy.

1187
01:45:03,959 --> 01:45:06,075
Why did Voldemort
need me to come and get this?

1188
01:45:06,239 --> 01:45:07,797
You dare speak his name?

1189
01:45:09,279 --> 01:45:10,792
You filthy half-blood!

1190
01:45:10,959 --> 01:45:13,473
It's all right.
He's just a curious lad. aren't you?

1191
01:45:15,319 --> 01:45:20,552
Prophecies can only be retrieved
by those about whom they are made.

1192
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:23,359
Which is lucky for you. really.

1193
01:45:26,959 --> 01:45:28,836
Haven't you always wondered...

1194
01:45:29,320 --> 01:45:34,269
...the reason for the connection
between you and the Dark Lord?

1195
01:45:34,999 --> 01:45:37,388
Why he was unable to kill you...

1196
01:45:37,559 --> 01:45:39,993
...when you were just an infant?

1197
01:45:41,320 --> 01:45:45,916
Don't you want to know
the secret of your scar?

1198
01:45:46,799 --> 01:45:51,031
All the answers are there. Potter.
in your hand.

1199
01:45:52,199 --> 01:45:54,110
All you have to do...

1200
01:45:54,640 --> 01:45:56,517
...is give it to me.

1201
01:45:56,800 --> 01:45:59,951
Then I can show you everything.

1202
01:46:08,360 --> 01:46:10,078
I've waited 14 years.

1203
01:46:10,639 --> 01:46:11,867
I know.

1204
01:46:13,159 --> 01:46:15,957
I guess I can wait a little longer.
Now. Stupefy.

1205
01:46:16,119 --> 01:46:17,472
Stupefy.

1206
01:46:32,959 --> 01:46:33,948
Levicorpus.

1207
01:46:40,199 --> 01:46:42,155
Pe trificus To talus .

1208
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:44,038
Well done. Neville.

1209
01:46:52,159 --> 01:46:53,638
Stupefy.

1210
01:46:55,319 --> 01:46:56,513
-Stupefy.
-Stupefy.

1211
01:47:07,199 --> 01:47:08,996
Stupefy.

1212
01:47:16,239 --> 01:47:18,434
Reducto.

1213
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:35,836
Get back to the door.

1214
01:48:09,680 --> 01:48:13,992
Department of Mysteries.
They got that bit right. didn't they?

1215
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:20,831
The voices.

1216
01:48:21,359 --> 01:48:23,315
Can you tell what they're saying?

1217
01:48:24,920 --> 01:48:26,990
There aren't any voices. Harry.

1218
01:48:27,720 --> 01:48:29,392
Let's get out of here.

1219
01:48:29,559 --> 01:48:31,072
I hear them too.

1220
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:36,594
Harry. it's just an empty archway.

1221
01:48:39,239 --> 01:48:40,592
Please. Harry.

1222
01:48:41,320 --> 01:48:43,117
Get behind me.

1223
01:49:27,760 --> 01:49:30,354
Did you actually believe...

1224
01:49:30,520 --> 01:49:34,911
...or were you truly naive enough
to think...

1225
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:40,435
...that children stood a chance
against us?

1226
01:49:43,799 --> 01:49:47,394
I'll make this simple for you. Potter.

1227
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:54,117
Give me the prophecy now...

1228
01:49:54,280 --> 01:49:58,114
...or watch your friends die.

1229
01:50:10,519 --> 01:50:11,872
Don't give it to him. Harry.

1230
01:50:37,080 --> 01:50:39,719
Get away from my godson.

1231
01:51:08,599 --> 01:51:11,067
Now. listen to me.
Take the others and get out of here.

1232
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:13,152
What? No. I'm staying with you.

1233
01:51:13,319 --> 01:51:16,038
You've done beautifully.

1234
01:51:16,679 --> 01:51:18,237
Now. let me take it from here.

1235
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:19,389
Black.

1236
01:51:45,439 --> 01:51:46,713
Exp elliarm us!

1237
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:48,154
Nice one. James.

1238
01:51:55,080 --> 01:51:56,513
Avada Kedavra.

1239
01:52:15,880 --> 01:52:18,110
No. No.

1240
01:52:41,160 --> 01:52:43,628
I killed Sirius Black.

1241
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:46,437
-You coming to get me?
-Crucio.

1242
01:52:58,280 --> 01:53:01,317
You've got to mean it, Harry.

1243
01:53:01,479 --> 01:53:05,074
She killed him. She deserves it.

1244
01:53:08,760 --> 01:53:11,832
You know the spell, Harry.

1245
01:53:22,919 --> 01:53:24,477
Do it.

1246
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:34,673
So weak.

1247
01:53:41,160 --> 01:53:44,232
It was foolish of you
to come here tonight. Tom.

1248
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:46,072
The Aurors are on their way.

1249
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:50,279
By which time I shall be gone.
and you...

1250
01:53:51,720 --> 01:53:53,756
...shall be dead.

1251
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:04,357
You've lost. old man.

1252
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:24,669
Harry.

1253
01:56:28,639 --> 01:56:30,072
So weak.

1254
01:56:30,559 --> 01:56:32,675
So vulnerable.

1255
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:37,789
Look at me.

1256
01:56:40,200 --> 01:56:44,273
Harry. it isn't how you are alike.

1257
01:56:44,440 --> 01:56:46,829
It's how you are not.

1258
01:56:51,559 --> 01:56:52,992
Harry?

1259
01:57:24,079 --> 01:57:25,478
You're the weak one...

1260
01:57:26,079 --> 01:57:30,038
...and you'll never know
love or friendship.

1261
01:57:33,319 --> 01:57:36,072
And I feel sorry for you.

1262
01:57:58,199 --> 01:58:01,509
You're a fool. Harry Potter.

1263
01:58:02,440 --> 01:58:07,355
And you will lose everything.

1264
01:58:21,680 --> 01:58:23,272
He's back.

1265
01:59:28,239 --> 01:59:29,831
I know how you feel. Harry.

1266
01:59:29,999 --> 01:59:31,557
No. you don't.

1267
01:59:36,959 --> 01:59:38,278
It's my fault.

1268
01:59:38,440 --> 01:59:41,591
No. the fault is mine.

1269
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:44,232
I knew it was only a matter of time...

1270
01:59:44,400 --> 01:59:47,358
...before Voldemort made the connection
between you.

1271
01:59:48,119 --> 01:59:52,192
I thought by distancing myself from you.
as I have done all year...

1272
01:59:52,359 --> 01:59:57,387
...he'd be less tempted. and therefore
you might be more protected.

1273
02:00:00,079 --> 02:00:03,276
The prophecy said:

1274
02:00:03,879 --> 02:00:07,667
“Neither one can live
while the other one survives.“

1275
02:00:08,959 --> 02:00:14,750
It means one of us is gonna
have to kill the other. in the end.

1276
02:00:16,680 --> 02:00:18,193
Yes.

1277
02:00:18,639 --> 02:00:20,152
Why didn't you tell me?

1278
02:00:20,319 --> 02:00:23,755
For the same reason
you tried to save Sirius.

1279
02:00:23,919 --> 02:00:26,274
The same reason your friends saved you.

1280
02:00:27,079 --> 02:00:30,435
After all these years.
after all you've suffered...

1281
02:00:30,599 --> 02:00:33,397
...I didn't want to cause you
any more pain.

1282
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:36,836
I cared too much about you.

1283
02:01:00,680 --> 02:01:02,910
How come you're not at the feast?

1284
02:01:03,079 --> 02:01:07,436
Lost all my possessions. Apparently
people have been hiding them.

1285
02:01:07,599 --> 02:01:08,588
That's awful.

1286
02:01:08,759 --> 02:01:10,556
Oh. it's all good fun.

1287
02:01:10,719 --> 02:01:14,029
But as it's the last night.
I really do need them back.

1288
02:01:14,199 --> 02:01:16,474
Do you want any help finding them?

1289
02:01:19,240 --> 02:01:22,312
I'm sorry about your godfather. Harry.

1290
02:01:29,079 --> 02:01:31,070
Are you sure you don't want
any help looking?

1291
02:01:31,240 --> 02:01:32,832
That's all right.

1292
02:01:32,999 --> 02:01:35,069
Anyway. my mum always said...

1293
02:01:35,239 --> 02:01:38,914
...the things we lose have a way
of coming back to us in the end.

1294
02:01:42,040 --> 02:01:45,157
If not always in the way we expect.

1295
02:01:46,599 --> 02:01:49,193
Think I'll just go have some pudding.

1296
02:02:23,399 --> 02:02:26,197
I've been thinking about something
Dumbledore said to me.

1297
02:02:26,359 --> 02:02:27,997
What's that?

1298
02:02:28,559 --> 02:02:31,232
That even though
we've got a fight ahead of us...

1299
02:02:31,400 --> 02:02:34,358
...we've got one thing
that Voldemort doesn't have.

1300
02:02:34,519 --> 02:02:35,952
Yeah?

1301
02:02:37,799 --> 02:02:40,029
Something worth fighting for.
