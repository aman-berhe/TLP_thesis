upon you all tonight...

this castle's walls.

their greatest weapon is you.

-So I noticed.

was teaching Potions.

-Yes. Miss...?
-Granger. sir.

381
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:31,797
That one there is Veritaserum.
It's a truth-telling serum.

382
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,554
And that would be Polyjuice Potion.

383
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,632
It's terribly tricky to make.

384
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:41,755
And this is Amortentia...

385
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,228
...the most powerful
love potion in the world.

386
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:48,794
It's rumored to smell differently to each
person according to what attracts them.

387
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,951
For example. I smell...

388
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:56,559
...freshly mown grass.
and new parchment. and...

389
00:32:56,719 --> 00:32:59,916
...spearmint toothpaste.

390
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,589
SLUGHORN: Amortentia doesn't create
actual love. That would be impossible.

391
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:09,550
But it does cause
a powerful infatuation or obsession.

392
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:16,114
And for that reason. it is probably
the most dangerous potion in this room.

393
00:33:21,439 --> 00:33:24,112
Sir? You haven't told us
what's in that one.

...is a curious little potion
known as Felix Felicis.

397

-Liquid luck.
-Yes. Miss Granger. Liquid luck.

You crush it. Don't cut it.

No. The instructions
specifically say to cut.

Draco Malfoy for a mission?

I know it sounds mad.

Has it occurred to you Snape was
simply pretending to offer Draco help...

851
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:11,029

what he was up to?

Well. I don't suppose it's going

1189
01:42:46,599 --> 01:42:47,748
My thoughts exactly.

1190
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:54,155
Always have a ampoule or two about
my person for just such occasions as this.

01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:02,195
I wish you could've seen him
in his prime.

1193
01:43:02,359 --> 01:43:05,874
Magnificent. he was. Just magnificent.

Oh. dear.

-Would you like me to say a few words?
-Yes.

He had a family. I trust?

Oh. yeah.

[SLUGHORN 8: HAGRID SINGING]

1206
01:44:11,839 --> 01:44:15,309
I had him from an egg. you know.
Tiny little thing he was when he hatched.

1207
01:44:15,479 --> 01:44:19,028
No bigger than a Pekinese.
A Pekinese. mind you.

1208
01:44:19,199 --> 01:44:24,148
How sweet. I once had a fish. Francis.
He was very dear to me.

1209
01:44:24,319 --> 01:44:29,268
One afternoon I came downstairs.
and he'd vanished.

1210
01:44:29,439 --> 01:44:30,952
Poof.

1211
01:44:31,120 --> 01:44:34,192
-That's very odd. isn't it?
-It is. isn't it?

1212
01:44:34,360 --> 01:44:37,909
But that's life. I suppose.

1213
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:43,200
You go along and then suddenly. poof!

[HAGRID SNORING]

1216
01:45:00,839 --> 01:45:03,831
It was a student who gave me Francis.

1217
01:45:04,799 --> 01:45:08,917
One spring afternoon
I discovered a bowl on my desk...

1218
01:45:09,799 --> 01:45:12,632
...with just a few inches
of clear water in it.

1219
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:16,790
And floating on the surface
was a flower petal.

1220
01:45:18,280 --> 01:45:20,635
As I watched. it sank.

1221
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:24,799
Just before it reached the bottom...

1222
01:45:24,959 --> 01:45:26,358
...it transformed...

1223
01:45:27,679 --> 01:45:29,431
...into a wee fish.

1224
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:33,076
It was beautiful magic.

1225
01:45:34,040 --> 01:45:36,190
Wondrous to behold.

1226
01:45:38,719 --> 01:45:41,358
The flower petal had come from a lily.

1227
01:45:43,640 --> 01:45:44,629
Your mother.

1228
01:45:46,600 --> 01:45:48,989
The day I came downstairs...

I know why you're here.

But I can't help you.

1233
01:46:07,960 --> 01:46:09,598
It would ruin me.

Do you know why I survived. professor?

The night I got this?

1236
01:46:19,480 --> 01:46:21,038
Because of her.

1237
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:23,638
Because she sacrificed herself.

1238
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:26,315
Because she refused to step aside.

1239
01:46:26,479 --> 01:46:29,551
Because her love was more powerful
than Voldemort.

RIDDLE:
I was in the library the other night...

1256
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:11,670
...in the Restricted Section...

1257
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:15,990
...and I read something rather odd
about a bit of rare magic.

1258
01:48:17,239 --> 01:48:19,878
It's called. as I understand it...

1259
01:48:21,119 --> 01:48:22,393
...a Horcrux.

1260
01:48:24,159 --> 01:48:26,798
-I beg your pardon?
-Horcrux.

1261
01:48:27,199 --> 01:48:29,759
I came across the term while reading...

1262
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:32,798
...and I didn't fully understand it.

1263
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:34,632
I'm not sure what you
were reading. Tom...

1264
01:48:34,799 --> 01:48:37,267
...but this is very dark stuff.
very dark indeed.

1265
01:48:37,439 --> 01:48:38,918
Which is...

1266
01:48:39,999 --> 01:48:41,751
...why I came to you.

1267
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:49,873
A Horcrux is an object in which a person
has concealed part of their soul.

1268
01:48:50,039 --> 01:48:52,553
But I don't understand
how that works. sir.

1269
01:48:55,039 --> 01:48:58,873
One splits one's soul and hides
part of it in an object.

1270
01:48:59,039 --> 01:49:02,509
By doing so. you're protected. should
you be attacked and your body destroyed.

1271
01:49:02,680 --> 01:49:03,749
Protected?

1272
01:49:03,919 --> 01:49:06,991
That part of your soul
that is hidden lives on.

1273
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:10,709
In other words. you cannot die.

1274
01:49:17,600 --> 01:49:20,637
And how does one split his soul. sir?

1275
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:23,473
SLUGHORN: I think you already know
the answer to that. Tom.

1276
01:49:24,639 --> 01:49:26,072
Murder.

1277
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:27,834
Yes.

1278
01:49:28,360 --> 01:49:33,070
Killing rips the soul apart.
It is a violation against nature.

once? For instance. isn't seven...?

01:49:38,639 --> 01:49:40,072
Seven?

1281
01:49:40,799 --> 01:49:45,873
Merlin's beard. Tom. Isn't it bad enough
to consider killing one person?

1282
01:49:46,039 --> 01:49:49,634
To rip the soul into seven pieces....

1283
01:49:50,760 --> 01:49:53,672
This is all hypothetical. isn't it. Tom?
All academic?

1284
01:49:58,240 --> 01:49:59,514
Of course. sir.

1285
01:50:02,360 --> 01:50:04,271
It'll be our little secret.

HARRY:
Sir.

1287
01:50:28,679 --> 01:50:30,715
This is beyond anything I imagined.

1288
01:50:30,879 --> 01:50:33,439
You mean to say he succeeded. sir.
in making a Horcrux?

1289
01:50:33,600 --> 01:50:36,592
Oh. yes. he succeeded. all right.
And not just once.

1290
01:50:36,759 --> 01:50:37,748
What are they exactly?

1291
01:50:37,919 --> 01:50:41,116
Could be anything.
Most commonplace of objects.

1292
01:50:44,159 --> 01:50:45,797
A ring. for example.

1293
01:50:46,399 --> 01:50:47,832
Or a book.

1294
01:50:49,079 --> 01:50:51,354
-Tom Riddle's diary.
-|t's a Horcrux. yes.

1295
01:50:51,839 --> 01:50:53,875
Four years ago. when you saved
Ginny's life...

1296
01:50:54,040 --> 01:50:56,235
...in the Chamber of Secrets.
you brought me this.

1297
01:50:56,399 --> 01:50:58,230
I knew this was
a different kind of magic.

1298
01:50:58,399 --> 01:51:03,189
Very dark. very powerful. But until tonight
I had no idea just how powerful.

1299
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:05,271
-The ring?
-Be|onged to Voldemort's mother.

1300
01:51:05,639 --> 01:51:10,190
Difficult to find.
Even more difficult to destroy.

1301
01:51:10,360 --> 01:51:14,069
But if you could find them all.
if you did destroy each Horcrux....

1302
01:51:14,239 --> 01:51:15,354
One destroys Voldemort.

1303
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:18,318
But how would you find them?
They could be hidden anywhere.

1304
01:51:18,479 --> 01:51:21,596
True. But magic. especially dark magic...

1305
01:51:34,999 --> 01:51:36,796
...Ieaves traces.

1306
01:51:44,279 --> 01:51:46,270
It's where you've been going.
isn't it. sir?

1307
01:51:46,439 --> 01:51:48,634
-When you leave the school?
-Yes.

1308
01:51:49,439 --> 01:51:52,397
And I think perhaps
I may have found another.

1309
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:56,473
But this time.
I cannot hope to destroy it alone.

1310
01:51:57,959 --> 01:52:02,430
Once again.
I must ask too much of you. Harry.

1311
01:52:06,240 --> 01:52:08,435
SNAPE: Have you ever considered
that you ask too much...

1312
01:52:08,600 --> 01:52:11,114
...that you take too much for granted?

1313
01:52:11,280 --> 01:52:16,115
Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind
that I don't want to do this anymore?

1314
01:52:16,280 --> 01:52:18,316
Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.

1315
01:52:19,159 --> 01:52:24,711
I will not negotiate with you. Severus.
You agreed. Nothing more to discuss.

1316
01:52:42,360 --> 01:52:43,918
Oh. Harry.

1317
01:52:46,399 --> 01:52:48,629
You need a shave. my friend.

1318
01:52:51,320 --> 01:52:55,359
You know. at times.
I forget how much you've grown.

1319
01:52:55,519 --> 01:52:59,307
At times. I still see the small boy
from the cupboard.

1320
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:03,075
Forgive my mawkishness. Harry.

1321
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:04,953
I'm an old man.

1322
01:53:05,119 --> 01:53:06,711
You still look the same to me. sir.

1323
01:53:08,119 --> 01:53:10,997
Just like your mother.
you're unfailingly kind.

1324
01:53:11,159 --> 01:53:14,231
A trait people never fail to undervalue.
I'm afraid.

1325
01:53:16,879 --> 01:53:21,191
The place to which we journey tonight
is extremely dangerous.

1326
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:24,716
I promised you could accompany me.
and I stand by that promise.

1327
01:53:24,879 --> 01:53:26,631
But there is one condition:

1328
01:53:26,799 --> 01:53:29,871
You must obey every command
I give you. without question.

1329
01:53:30,719 --> 01:53:32,277
Yes. sir.

1330
01:53:32,439 --> 01:53:34,475
You do understand what I'm saying?

1331
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:37,429
Should I tell you to hide. you hide.

1332
01:53:37,599 --> 01:53:39,829
Should I tell you to run. you run.

1333
01:53:39,999 --> 01:53:43,833
Should I tell you to abandon me
and save yourself. you must do so.

1334
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:50,313
Your word. Harry.

1335
01:53:51,879 --> 01:53:53,312
My word.

1336
01:53:54,080 --> 01:53:55,672
Take my arm.

1337
01:53:57,039 --> 01:53:59,348
Sir. I thought you couldn't
Apparate within Hogwarts.

1338
01:53:59,999 --> 01:54:03,309
Well. being me has its privileges.

1339
01:54:48,639 --> 01:54:50,197
DUMBLEDORE:
This is the place.

1340
01:54:50,959 --> 01:54:52,472
Oh. yes.

1341
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:55,828
This place has known magic.

1342
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:04,999
-Sir!
-In order to gain passage...

1343
01:55:05,159 --> 01:55:06,512
...payment must be made.

1344
01:55:06,680 --> 01:55:10,150
Payment intended
to weaken any intruder.

1345
01:55:11,679 --> 01:55:13,431
-You should've let me. sir.
-No. Harry.

1346
01:55:13,879 --> 01:55:16,473
Your blood's much more precious
than mine.

1347
01:55:37,479 --> 01:55:41,916
Voldemort will not have made it easy
to discover his hiding place.

1348
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:45,277
He will have put certain defenses
in position.

1349
01:55:47,759 --> 01:55:49,112
Careful.

1350
01:56:11,679 --> 01:56:12,748
There it is.

1351
01:56:14,199 --> 01:56:16,793
The only question is.
how do we get there?

1352
01:56:38,080 --> 01:56:39,832
