In time, the brothers reached a river

But being learned in the magical arts...

1183
01:46:18,399 --> 01:46:23,348
...the three brothers simply
waved their wands and made a bridge.

1184
01:46:24,639 --> 01:46:26,630
Before they could cross, however...

1185
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:30,759
...they found their path blocked
by a hooded figure.

1186
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:34,709
It was Death, and he felt cheated.

1187
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:37,838
Cheated because travelers would
normally drown in the river.

1188
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:39,956
But Death was cunning.

1189
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:43,438
He pretended to congratulate
the three brothers on their magic...

1190
01:46:43,599 --> 01:46:48,673
...and said that each had earned a prize for
having been clever enough to evade him.

1191
01:46:49,200 --> 01:46:53,591
The oldest asked for a wand
more powerful than any in existence.

1192
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:58,151
So Death fashioned him one
from an elder tree that stood nearby.

1193
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:03,638
The second brother decided he wanted
to humiliate Death even further...

1194
01:47:03,799 --> 01:47:08,077
...and asked for the power
to recall loved ones from the grave.

1195
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:12,598
So Death plucked a stone from the river
and offered it to him.

1196
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:17,108
Finally,
Death turned to the third brother.

1197
01:47:18,280 --> 01:47:19,633
A humble man...

1198
01:47:19,799 --> 01:47:23,838
...he asked for something that would
allow him to go forth from that place...

1199
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:27,037
...without being followed by Death.

1200
01:47:28,080 --> 01:47:33,712
And so it was that Death reluctantly
handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.
